Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.
Mondays.
Well, good morning to you too.
Oh, hey.
Where? I'd love hay.
In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around premiered on ABC.
The show, in which a young, bachelor horse is forced to reevaluate his priorities when he agrees to raise three human children, was initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharine and not good, but the family comedy struck a chord with America and went on to air for nine seasons.
The star of Horsin' Around, BoJack Horseman, is our guest tonight.
Welcome, BoJack.
It is good to be here, Charlie.
Sorry I was late.
The traffic It's really no problem.
I parked in a handicapped spot.
I hope that's okay.
You parked in a I'm sorry, disabled spot.
Is that the proper nomenclature? Maybe you should move the car.
No, I don't think I should drive right now.
I'm incredibly drunk.
You're telling me that you're drunk right now? Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview? I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.
Yes.
Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around.
To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal? Charlie, listen, you know, I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at the time, I can tell you Is it okay to say "shit"? Please don't.
'Cause I I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it is.
It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay.
You know, because in real life Did I already say the thing about the urethra? Well, let's talk about real life.
What have you been doing since the show's cancellation That's a great question, Charlie.
I, uh Uh, I Um Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury! In the case of one-year-old Phoenix, you are the father.
Morning, sunshine.
Why so gloomy, roomie? First of all, we're not roommates.
You are my houseguest.
Well, we don't need to put labels on things.
You sleep on my couch, and you don't pay rent.
I've had tapeworms that were less parasitic.
I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place.
Because my parents kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go, and even though you don't want anyone to know it You secretly have a good heart.
You told me they didn't approve of your "alternative lifestyle.
" I thought you were, like, a troubled gay teen or something.
I didn't realize by "alternative lifestyle" that you meant you were lazy.
That's on you for making assumptions.
Also, if you're looking for the Toaster Strudels, I got really high last night and ate them all.
Did you say you've had tapeworms? Thanks for meeting me here.
I would have invited you to my office, but the electric company shut off our power.
That's unfortunate.
Just an issue with the bank and a lack of money in it.
Now, as you know, Penguin is very eager to publish your memoirs, but you keep missing your deadlines.
I know, and I'm sorry, but I am making great progress.
The BoJack Horseman Story, written by BoJack Horseman.
Chapter one.
Chapter one.
Chapter One.
Look, we really need a bestseller here at Penguin.
Things are not that great for me, money wise.
Aren't you an editor at a major publishing house? Yeah, a publishing house.
When was the last time you saw a book? I thought I saw someone reading one in the park the other day, but it turned out it was a takeout menu.
Whenever you're ready.
We're living month to month here.
We're kind of counting on your autobiography to save the company, no pressure.
That's actually a lot of pressure.
Have you considered working with a ghostwriter? Ugh, no, thank you.
Look, just give me one more week, and I will give you some pages that'll knock your ass back to the South Pole.
I'm from Cincinnati.
It that doesn't matter.
I'll call you in a week.
Yes, one week.
I'm telling you, this book is a top priority for me.
Oh, right.
Yeesh.
You're wearing that to the prom? What, you don't think it's cute? Neigh way, Jose.
"Neigh way, Jose.
" I improvised that line.
I mean, it was written, but I gave it the old BoJack spin.
Hey, how many times have you watched this episode? Yeah, but do you get it, though? Because "nay" means no, but it's also a thing that horses say.
It works on every level.
I get it.
Ah, you don't get it.
Are you drunk? Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.
It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.
Yes.
Ah, yeah, I see.
You're just bummed out because Princess Carolyn dumped you last night.
BoJack, we need to talk.
Hey, check out the rug on that guy.
Slow and steady, am I right, ladies? Ha-cha-cha.
Who does he think he's fooling? Turtles don't have hair.
Stop embarrassing me.
That is Lenny Turteltaub.
You know, I am not crazy about the bread here.
Mm.
Why do I keep eating it? BoJack, can you please just listen for a second? You have my undivided attention.
I think we should see other people.
Were we not seeing other people? BoJack, I'm almost there.
Wait.
Shh! Shut up.
Now, that's a horse of a different cruller? Oh! God, that's good comedy.
BoJack! What? Everyone gets a mulligan, and my mulligan was Carey Mulligan.
I'm kidding, jeez.
It was Emily Mortimer.
What is the problem here? Are you embarrassed of me because I'm a has-been? Because you know that I'm writing that book that is gonna make everybody love me again.
You're not really writing a book.
Well, I already spent my advance, so that's a first step.
Look, this has been a lot of fun, but I need to start thinking about my future.
I mean, you don't even respect me enough to have a baby with me.
Whoa, what? I never explicitly said that.
You said it with your actions.
What actions? Oh, look at that baby.
Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw? What? What? What? No, no, wha Step away from the stolen vehicle, sir! No, no, no.
Misunderstanding, officer.
I was running away from my girlfriend whom I don't respect enough to have a baby with.
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? Oh, face it.
You're afraid of commitment.
I'm not afraid of commitment.
I commit to things all the time.
It's the following through on that commitment that I take issue with.
Hey, stupid, isn't that your friend over there? Oh, Mr.
Peanutbutter? God, I hope he doesn't see us.
Is that BoJack Horseman? Oh, jeez, here we go.
Mr.
Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same room.
What is this, a crossover episode? You know, that gets funnier every time.
You're being sarcastic, but I think it does actually get funnier every time.
We're actually in the middle of breaking up right now, so if you could just Yeah? You're in the middle of it? Yeah, that's right.
So would it be awkward if I joined you right now? Yes, actually, it's very awkward.
Is that not clear? Yeah, this is awkward right now? Yes, please leave.
How are you, Mr.
Peanutbutter? Oh, living the dream, P.
C.
, living the dream.
Why are you making conversation? Oh, let's see, it's the English word It's called being polite, BoJack.
But am I crazy that this is a bad time? Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh, BoJack? What? You'll get that one later, man.
Erica, get out of here with that face.
Would it kill you to be civil? This is why we're breaking up.
So it's not because of the thing with the baby? It's because of a lot of things! Waiter, could we please have the check? Thank you.
We haven't even ordered yet.
I have wasted so many dinners on you, BoJack Horseman.
I don't know how you can expect anyone else to love you when you so clearly hate yourself.
Here you go.
Let me see that.
$10 for bread? I don't want to live in a society where the premeal bread isn't free.
It is free if you order a meal.
Can you take me home, please? Yeah, but I didn't even eat that much bread.
What did I have? I must have had You ate nine baskets, sir.
Nine really? Great, now I'm gonna feel like a fat ass all week.
You've seen me naked.
Do you think I'm getting chubby? You want to know the real reason we're breaking up? What was that? Sorry.
Couldn't hear you over the sound of my calories not metabolizing.
This is so classic you.
You're using this bread thing to avoid talking about our relationship.
No, that is definitely not happening.
I'd like to go home now.
You think I'm fat.
So yeah, technically I was dumped, but the real headline of the evening was, "Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end.
" What kind of headline is that? Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago? God damn it! Stop the presses.
You're not fat.
Oh, hey, let's throw a party.
That'll cheer you up.
No, it won't.
It'll cheer you up.
I'll stand in the corner by myself eating cotton candy until I barf like I did at your last party.
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? That was a good party.
Hey, didn't we get a cotton candy machine for that party? Who told you Princess Carolyn and I broke up? She did.
What? You never took me home, jerk! Oh, everything's my fault.
Take me home.
Okay, jeez.
But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.
I'll slow the car down to a crawl, and you can duck and roll.
You know what, you can take a last look at this face, because it's the last time you're gonna see it.
Hey-up! Hello? I've got Princess Carolyn for you.
Uh, okay.
BoJack.
Oh, my God, we just broke up.
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.
I pride myself on my ability to separate my professional life from my personal life.
Great.
Then, as my agent, do you think I'm getting fat? No way.
You are in the prime of your life, never looked better.
What about as my ex-girlfriend? You look like a pile of crap ate a second pile of crap and then crapped out a third pile of crap.
Wait, wait, so which pile of crap do I look like? The third one.
What? That's the worst one.
I'm not calling you as your ex.
I'm calling you as your agent.
Remember that book you're pretending to write? Well, Penguin wants an update on your progress.
Does Tuesday work for you, or are you gonna be too busy this week masturbating to old pictures of yourself? I told you, that's not what was happening that time.
I was masturbating to what the picture represented.
You walked in at the worst possible moment! So, Tuesday, though? Yes, fine! Whoo! You don't have anything? Hey, you got the electricity back.
Good for you.
This company is in dire straits.
We made a series of very bad investments.
Ever hear of a young adult franchise called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu? Uh, no.
Then why did we spend $20 million on marketing? It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.
Uh Look, I know you're a busy guy.
Actually, I am a busy guy.
I live a very active lifestyle.
Can't I just stay home with you? I know kindergarten is scary, but you're a big girl now, and you have to be brave.
Okay, Daddy.
Wait, did you just call me "Daddy"? Little Sabrina grew up right before our eyes, right, Todd? Todd? Todd! What? Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes? Yes! We're tired of waiting.
We're hiring you a ghostwriter.
Diane "Nugent"? She's great, and she's got a thing for horses.
Check this out.
Hey, Secretariat.
You know, I always wanted to play Secretariat in a movie.
He's kind of my personal hero.
Could never get the project off the ground, though.
I mean, there was this one time I came close in the '90s, and people got tired of seeing running on-screen.
Don't tell me.
Tell her! She's cute.
Call her.
That's a loan, by the way.
We can't afford to be giving out free books to people, but you can take anything you want from the Swamp Monsters swag box.
Oh, God, I'm a failure.
Oh, you're not a failure.
Why did I say I could write a book? Because you have an amazing story to tell.
Relax.
Relax? Easy for you to say, you hippie.
You've never had a day of stress in your life.
Ow.
Why? And that's for trying to sell E on the cartel's turf.
Oh, where's Gabriela? She went back to Mexico City, ese, to be with her husband.
What? No! Gabriela, why? Who? We were talking about me.
Can you try to focus for, like, a second? Oh, yeah, sorry.
You were saying? Never should have signed this book deal.
You know what my problem is? I can't say no to people because I want everyone to like me.
You want everyone to like you? Yeah, why? Do people not like me? Uh Uh What were we talking about? I can see the headline now, "Stupid BoJack writes a stupid book about his stupid life, nobody cares.
" What newspapers are you reading? Hey, why don't you just let that lady write your book and be done with it? Better question, why are you in my kitchen? I'm making breakfast.
We had sex last night, dummy.
Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone on airplane mode when I drink.
This lady probably thinks I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.
I hate her and her stupid, impossible-to-pronounce last name, Na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga.
You haven't even met her.
Give her a chance.
Oh, you should invite her to the party.
What party? Why are you so obsessed with throwing a party all of a sudden? Ow, ow, ow! You know how much money we lost 'cause of you? I can't even afford a hall now for my daughter's 15th birthday, and now I got a hundred guests coming and nowhere to put them.
You owe me a party, cabrÃ³n, and if you don't deliver Because parties are fun? This book is really important to me.
I don't want to just hand it off to some stranger.
If it's so important, why have you written literally nothing in a year and a half? It's too much pressure.
This book is my one shot at preserving my legacy.
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good, I'm gonna be a joke forever.
Everyone thinks that I'm just this washed-up hack, but actually Oh, God, actually, what if they're right? I can't breathe.
Am I dying? Toast.
I smell burning toast! Oh, my God, my toast! Todd, on my grave, I want it to say that I was born in 1975.
No one's gonna believe Damn it, can't you respect a dying man's wish? You're not dying.
Well, we did everything we could.
Nurse, record the time of death.
It doesn't get easier.
It never gets easier.
What I don't What do you mean he's dead? That's right, sweetheart.
He died of a broken heart because you didn't appreciate him enough, and now he's gone forever.
We might have gone too dark on that series finale.
I'm required to hand you over to the child protective services.
You're the state's problem now.
No! Do you just take those DVDs with you everywhere you go? Linus walked around with a blanket.
No one gave him shit for it.
How long is that doctor going to take? I have a meeting with another client at 3:00.
You have other clients? No, I make a living off you sitting on your ass all day.
Are your other clients more talented than I am? Your silence speaks volumes.
Well, BoJack, it looks like what you experienced was a mild anxiety attack.
Jesus, if that's mild, I don't want to know what spicy feels like.
Too smart for the room? It was a salsa joke, people.
You've been overstressed.
I need you to take it easy.
Take it easy, are you kidding? He doesn't have a job.
He has no real responsibilities.
He doesn't do anything but take it easy.
Well, can you take it even easier? I can try, doctor.
I can try.
This book deal is obviously stressing you out.
Will you just call the ghostwriter already? What, you want me to call this woman on the phone? Well, you just had another anxiety attack.
And Entertainment Weekly said I wasn't consistent.
Really, not even a pity laugh? I did almost die.
Ha.
I have to check on some other patients.
You have other patients? BoJack, let's have a party, okay? I'll organize the whole thing.
You can invite the ghostwriter and have a nice, casual conversation in a fun, pressure-free environment.
Okay, fine.
We'll have a party.
Oh, thank God.
But we're not getting a cotton candy machine.
I can't control myself around those things.
I totally hear what you are saying, and I will do my best.
SeÃ±or Horseman, I will never forget your generosity today.
You have made a powerful ally for life.
Mwah.
Let's dance! Todd, who was that guy? Who are all these people? Oh, you know, just a variety of folks from all walks of life.
Is this a quinceaÃ±era? Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls is a quinceaÃ±era? Now who's racist? I find that piÃ±ata offensive.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present.
BoJack! Oh, good Lord.
Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Can you believe this, the two of us in the same house? Is this a crossover episode? No, I'm just kidding around, man.
Seriously, though, how are you? Well, I've been kind of up and Living the dream, huh? Yeah.
Hey, we'll catch up later, all right? I want to talk to you.
Erica, how are you looking so beautiful? I'm furious.
Hey, BoJack, right? BoJack Horseman? Yes.
Oh, I'm I'm sorry, I don't want to mispronounce your name.
It's Diane.
Oh, Diane.
Thanks for inviting me to your party.
Sorry I haven't really been mingling.
I get kind of awkward at parties.
Have you tried alcohol? I don't know.
Parties make me anxious in a real broad sense.
Like, look at that guy.
He's having fun.
Why haven't I figured it out? What guy? No, there's no guy there.
I'm just saying, like, a guy, you know? Oh, okay, yeah.
I'm probably just overthinking it because I never got the practice because I didn't get invited to any parties in high school.
What am I talking about? You don't care about any of that.
Shut up, Diane.
You're at a party, compliment the host.
You have a lovely home.
Yeah, well, if you're gonna throw away most of your adult life on some dumb sitcom, you might as well get a sweet house out of the deal, right? So what are you working on these days? Well, mostly I just sit around the house and complain about things.
Yeah, how's that working out for you? I can't complain, so you know.
No, I will not have sex with you! This girl wants me to have sex with her.
No, I'm just kidding around.
You're a good sport.
Ugh, you know who that is? Mr.
Peanutbutter? Yeah, he was on that show Mr.
Peanutbutter's House about that dog who adopted the three human kids.
What a dumb idea for a TV show.
You people are all right.
Who wants an autograph? He's so stupid he doesn't realize how miserable he should be.
I envy that.
Hey, do you know the story of the dad from The Brady Bunch? Do I know his story? If I recall correctly, he was bringing up three boys of his own.
Right, but They were four men living all together, but they were all alone.
That is profoundly sad.
No, the story is that the guy who played the dad hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor, and he considered it beneath him.
Sound familiar? That's not all that was beneath him.
Gay joke.
Sorry, I'm better than that.
Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives.
You're actually in a really good position now, because you can pretty much do anything you want.
You're responsible for your own happiness, you know? Good Lord, that's depressing.
No, it's not.
I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.
Todd! I need help.
What would make you happy? Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.
Is that all? I can help you with that.
Yeah? I mean, would you even want to? You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.
You'd probably get sick of me.
I don't think that's going to happen.
No? No, BoJack.
Okay.
Well, then I guess you're hired, but don't put all that stuff about how sad I am in the book.
Oh, that doesn't count.
We weren't on the clock yet.
Yeah, exactly.
You're only my ghostwriter starting nah Starting now.
You got it.
BoJack! Ugh, this guy.
Hey, man, wanted to let you know, you are out of beer.
Oh, I see you've met my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.
You drank all my beer? Also, you two are dating? Yeah.
You're dating him? Yes.
This is your boyfriend? That is correct.
Uh-huh.
You are going out with you? Uh-huh.
But in a sexual way, not just as friends? That's right.
You have seen her naked.
Many times, yes.
You are attracted to this? Yes.
This penis has been inside this vagina.
Yep.
But in a sexual way.
Oh, yes.
Humph.
Ugh.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay? I'm just I'm fine.
I'm just I'm really happy for you.
Should we get someone, or No, everything's Oh, this is really Wonderful.
Oh, God.
Starting now.
Boxer versus raptor.
Say when.
When.
Yeah, you'll never guess who's here.
Think '90s.
No, BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around.
No, I mean, he got a little fatter, but it's definitely him.
He looks really sad.
It's hilarious.
Get over here now.
I told you, I don't know where it is.
Don't put things in my butt if you want them back.
And hold for Princess Carolyn, please.
Thanks, Laura.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d d Jellicles do and Jelli d BoJack, it's your favorite agent.
Yeah, some agent, you couldn't even get me in the room for War Horse.
There were, like, ten horses in that movie.
I didn't need to be the warhorse.
Listen, dummy, I want to make sure you're all set for your first day with Diane tomorrow.
Is she gonna ask me a bunch of personal questions? The woman we're paying to ghostwrite your memoir? Yeah, probably.
Okay, all right, there's no need to get What, catty? Are you gonna say catty? I was not gonna say catty.
Oh, what were you gonna say? I was gonna say catty because you're a cat.
Goodbye, BoJack.
Laura, I know you're listening.
You got it, right? Laura, do not respond to him.
Goodbye, BoJack.
She got it.
Oh, my God.
Take another one.
Take another one.
Excuse me, I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight, and I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it.
Excuse me? I was actually already in a bad mood, but I thought maybe for one night, I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself, but now because of you and your friends, I feel more self-conscious than ever.
If we were bothering you so much, why didn't you just leave? Because I didn't think of that, and now I feel stupid.
Look, I have a right to be here.
No! Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away with things, but I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others, and I hate you, and you are a horrible person, and you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person.
You think I'm pretty? Well, that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices.
What'd you say? I was tweeting about all the weird stuff you do in bed.
Good morning.
Ah! Why are you here? I slept here.
Yeah, but why are you still here? Breakfast.
That better not be my last Toaster Strudel.
No, there were three left.
Well, get out of here.
My memoirist is gonna show up soon, and I don't need you What's your name? Pam.
I don't need you Pam-ing up the place when she gets here.
Hey, BoJack.
Ah! Why are you here? You told me to come at 9:00.
That doesn't sound like me.
I have your email right here.
"Diane, why don't you come over Tuesday morning at 9:00? Also, you should bring this email with you because I might not remember it because I just took a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha ha.
Also, please don't put in my book that I use horse tranquilizers, ha ha.
I just use a small dose to help me fall asleep at night and then a much, much larger dose to get me through the day.
Also, I'm drunk.
Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone.
Please don't put that in my book, book, book, book 'em, dildo.
Does it taste like magenta in here?" Then I think you fell asleep on the keyboard because it just says the letter "B" 27 times.
That does sound like me.
Well, anyway, this is my businessperson Excuse me? Here to help me with some business needs.
All very above board.
Uh, what'd you say? No need to mention her in the book either, unless it's a business book.
Ha ha, classic BoJack.
Why are you here? Oh, funny story, I'm filming a reality show later, so I thought I'd drop by with the old tennis ball and chain.
That is neither funny nor a story nor a reason for you to drop by.
Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag about his reality show.
Get this, I am starring in a pilot presentation for a celebrity reality show.
It's pretty cutting edge, huh? Yeah, if it's 2003.
Ha ha.
Don't tell VH1 that.
Seriously, though, please don't tell VH1 that.
We are calling it Peanutbutter and Jelly.
Get it? Because I'm Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Okay, who's jelly? No, no, no.
It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
It's wordplay.
You may have too forgiving a definition of the word "wordplay.
" Well, it's a working title.
Well, it could be working harder, and that's wordplay.
How'd you even get in here? Your roommate let us in.
Mi casa es su casa.
And that is the last of the Toaster Strudels, and now my morning is ruined.
Could you guys keep it down, okay? I'm kind of on a date right now.
In America, I am actually considered very handsome.
Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast, and when I get back, I want everyone out of my house except for you and you and Who are you again? The girl you had sex with.
Right.
You definitely should have already been gone.
I really shouldn't eat chocolate 'cause it can literally kill me.
Oh, I know.
But I love chocolate.
Story of my life.
Hey, excuse me.
Yes, I am BoJack Horseman, star of Horsin' Around.
Yeah, okay, I don't care.
Those are my muffins.
I'm sorry, I I don't understand.
Did you bring them into the store with you? No, but I was going to buy them.
That's the last box, and I had dibs on them.
Really? You had dibs? Yeah, dibs.
I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom.
Look, I don't even want the muffins.
I was just looking at them, but I got to say, if you put muffins down, they're not your muffins.
So what, I was supposed to take them into the bathroom with me? You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.
You just left them out here.
Yeah, in the produce section.
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section.
That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs? Look, I don't want to get into a whole thing here.
Then give me the muffins.
No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.
You think that because you're a pseudo-celebrity, normal rules don't apply to you? Pseudo? Would you say that to Eric McCormack? Look, I've had a rough morning, so I don't need You've had a rough morning? I spent the last ten months Hey! Sorry, wasn't listening.
See ya.
You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman.
Oh, really? I'm gonna regret buying muffins? What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them? Oh, man, they do have a lot of saturated fat.
Why'd I buy these? Man, I really regret buying those muffins and then eating them all on the drive home.
Well, my date with Ayako went really well.
Thanks for asking.
I specifically didn't ask, and I'll thank you to respect my total lack of interest in your personal life.
She's hilarious.
I never met a girl who was so curious about American bank routing numbers.
Still not interested.
Should we get started on the book? What's your hurry? What do you guys think I should get Ayako for our 12-hour anniversary? She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name.
Okay, let's get to work.
Let's start at the beginning.
What was your childhood like? Normal.
Normal? Yeah, it was, uh, normal normal childhood stuff.
Here's your omelet.
I'm sorry it's not as good as the omelets your secretary makes, but then you're not married to your secretary, are you? Well, maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion, I would be.
Mommy, can I have an omelet? You're the birthday boy.
Normal childhood, and then just get right into the big, famous part.
Look, if you're not ready to talk, we can wait.
I am ready to talk.
Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents? They're so normal.
That's crazy.
You sound like a crazy person, not me.
Stop being so crazy, crazy.
Why are you calling me crazy? Okay.
Was your father Hold on, I got to take this.
Hello? Hey, BoJack, I've got Princess Carolyn for you.
It's urgent.
Great, put her on.
Just a sec.
I'll see if she's available.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And d BoJack, are you watching MSNBSea right now? Great question.
Well, I didn't fall down on my remote, randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea while simultaneously crippling myself, thus physically forcing me to watch MSNBSea, so no.
No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.
Yeah, well, Hamlet, you might want to turn it on.
They're talking about you.
Ooh! Good things, I hope.
Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal, a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.
Welcome to the program, Neal.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, I met this guy.
All Neal wanted when he got home and I emphasize, from Afghanistan was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins.
When he went to the supermarket and called dibs on the last box Well, tell us what happened, Neal.
BoJack Horseman, from the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around, refused to respect my dibs.
Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman? Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.
Oh, not the sneezing pic Why do they always use the sneezing picture? In the '90s, we laughed at your antics.
Oh, how we laughed.
"Ha ha ha," we chortled in rapturous glee.
But when you deny the dibs called by our men and women on the frontlines, that is a sick joke, sir.
A sick, sick joke, indeed, and you'll forgive me if I chortle no longer, for, to me, there is nothing the least bit funny about stealing a meal from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.
Wait, wait, you stole muffins from a Navy SEAL? I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL.
I just thought he was the regular kind of seal.
This is classic Hollywood elitism.
BoJack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV, that makes him better than everybody.
Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV, so now I'm better than everybody! That's right, Neal.
You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow.
You guys think I should call in and set the record straight? BoJack, these people feed off controversy.
If you dignify the story with a response, it's just gonna fan I'm now receiving word that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.
Sorry, stopped listening.
You were ramping up to a "yes," right? BoJack, what you did today was a slap in the face of America's heroes.
Will you apologize? Okay, enough about America's heroes.
Can we talk about dibs? Because he didn't even really have dibs.
If he had legitimate dibs Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.
I hid them in the produce section! You left them totally out in the open.
That's hiding? How did you survive in Afghanistan? Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins! Hey, guess what, I can't give them back 'cause I ate them all, okay? Dude.
Hold on, just to be clear, since this morning, you ate all the muffins? Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
Is that what you want to hear? Neal, was it a small container of muffins, like two to four muffins? No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that.
Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box? Yeah, there were exactly 12! I ate 12 muffins, and I didn't even want one! There's your goddamn news story, the mystery of my missing goddamn self-respect! How'd I come off? Well, that went slightly better than the worst it could have possibly gone, so hooray? It's not even about the muffins.
Everyone is just out to get me because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.
Well, at least you've got some privacy.
My boyfriend's filming a reality show at our house.
If I want to be alone, I have to go to the roof because it's the only place they don't have insurance to film.
You go on the roof? Yeah, just to get some work done.
Is that really weird? No, it's adorable.
When I was a kid, I used to climb onto the roof with my dad and look at the stars.
What about you? Were you close with your father? Happy Father's Day, Daddy.
What is this supposed to be, a lima bean? It's a heart.
That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.
I tried my best.
No, you didn't.
You slacked off and took the easy way out.
In this world, you can either do things the easy way or the right way.
You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat? Um, the canal? You go around the horn the way God intended! Uneventful.
What? What? I asked if you were close with your father, and you sat here in silence for five minutes and then said, "Uneventful.
" You know what, this is a really good conversation, and I definitely want to keep having it, but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing, so maybe we could put a pin in this thorough deconstruction of my past, so I can put that other thing to bed before it spirals out of con I had dibs! My dibs were on those muffins! Your dibs were void! I spent a year in Afghanistan making America safer, and this is the thanks I get? Really, you, specifically, made America safer? Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree that the troops are heroes.
I don't agree to that.
Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically.
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.
Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.
What? Did you just say you think the troops are jerks? Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you? I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.
No, no, no.
The troops are jerks? Oh, God.
Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun Hello? Princess Carolyn needs to talk to you immediately.
Great, put her on.
She's actually just getting out of a meeting.
Can you hold for a sec? You called me.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d Ugh.
d Jellicles would And Jellicles can d BoJack.
Ah! I'm gonna level with you, honey.
This whole you hating the troops thing is not great.
I don't hate the troops.
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.
I just think that he's wrong about the muffins.
I know, BoJack just like always, you're right, and everyone else is wrong.
But if you don't swallow your pride, this is never gonna let up.
I know you're stubborn I'm not stubborn.
I'm proud.
That's kind of the same thing.
No, it's an important distinction.
Okay, fine.
You're not stubborn.
But I'm about to tell you something very important, so I want you to listen carefully.
I'm getting another call.
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d It is now day three of the great BoJack jerk-off Really? That's the name we came up with for this? Who came up with that? Was it Randy? Did Randy come up with that? Anyway, the former television actor who hates our troops has not left his home since his controversial remarks on Monday about how he hates the troops.
BoJack Horseman makes me sick.
He voiced his opinion, even though it was unpopular, and that's the most cowardly thing a person can do.
After we made love, he covered himself in sheets like an Arab.
At this very moment, Congress is voting on a major education bill that could completely restructure the Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we've got some big news on the BoJack Horseman front.
It appears that BoJack's Lexus is coming out of the garage.
This is very big news, indeed.
Any comment on BoJack's controversial remarks this week? Uh, nope.
So where are we going? Don't worry, I've got a plan.
Whoa! Jeez.
Ayako, hey, I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto.
_ _ _ _ _ Hey, I meant I was rich because I have friends like George Bailey.
_ _ _ Hello? Well, I'm out of ideas.
We can hide out at my place while we make a plan.
Yeah, great, just get me away from the cameras.
Do we really need to be filming this? It's for my reality show.
You never know when gold's gonna strike.
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.
That's why you never know.
BoJack, be nice.
Just pretend they're not there.
Okay.
Well, I Could you speak up, please? I'd like to Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's too loud.
I want to fix this as quickly as possible.
I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore, even though I was definitely right.
I just want my privacy back, so I can finish writing my tell-all memoir, so everyone will pay attention to me again.
I've already reached out to the McBeal camp.
He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize and present to him a box of muffins as a symbol of your great admiration for the American military and everything they do.
But I ate the muffins.
I know.
We got another box.
It's in the cupboard.
Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.
We've been here for ten minutes! It's okay, we'll get more muffins.
I'll get the muffins, and they're on me.
I just found out I got I'm helping! Hooray! So where are we gonna do this? Do I have to go on MSNBSea? No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.
Oh, why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly? You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly if there's no jelly.
It's a pun.
It's not a pun if it only works one way.
Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now? Look, I know tempers are high, but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality show, which we all agree is really clever.
We can edit this to make me look smart, right? d Yeah d d Peanutbutter d d Come on d How's this look? Looks good? Okay.
Marker, sound, speed.
Well, here I am, hanging out with my good friend BoJack Horseman, enjoying each other's company, as we often do.
Yes, this is all very authentic and natural.
Oh, someone's at the door! I will see who it is.
Wow, this is a surprise.
Neal McBeal.
Hello, sir.
Thank you for inviting me into your home.
It is lovely.
BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal? Ahem.
Oh, yeah, Todd? What the hell is this? I tried to buy the muffins, but my bank card got declined for some reason.
But don't worry, I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.
I'm sorry? Yeah, they're just giving them away behind In-N-Out.
Why does anybody pay for anything? Ow.
Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration, please accept this bag of stale hamburger buns.
What? Yes, hamburger buns.
It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash, sadly, far too often.
I'm listening.
We send our muffins overseas, and they come back as stale hamburger buns, but that doesn't mean we should love them any less, because in their own way, aren't stale hamburger buns just as good? Mmm.
American made.
So what you're saying is, you think I'm a hero.
Well, I don't know if I Say it, BoJack.
Say I'm a hero.
You're a hero.
The troops are all heroes, every single one.
Great.
And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns.
Okay, you can let go of the bag now.
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.
Yeah, me neither.
I think we're in agreement here.
Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.
Okay.
And finally, I don't Hey, look, Mr.
Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.
Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am? Hey, where'd he get that bucket from? Who gave him a bucket? Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make.
Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? Come on.
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Hey, can anyone find a handle? Oh, thank you, my friend.
You're a real hero.
Unbelievable.
What's your name, young lady? Well, my real name's Angela, but my friends call me Jelly.
What? Oh, my God, did we get that? Please tell me we got that.
You want a day-old hamburger bun? I'm all right.
How'd it go down there? You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe.
No one ever wants to hear the truth.
I want to hear the truth.
I don't know if you want to tell it, though.
What do you mean? Mr.
Normal Childhood, Mr.
Uneventful Father? Look, I can write you the standard empty-calorie celebrity tell-some, if that's what you're looking for, but I thought you might want more than that.
I do.
Well, then you're going to have to open up and give me something real.
What, you think I can't open up? Well, I don't know if you can or not.
You certainly haven't.
Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all.
You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you? I don't know, are you an asshole? Okay, full truth, here we go.
You want to know about my parents? They drank a lot.
My father was a failed novelist.
My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for it.
He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records.
He made me build my own tree house, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty, Christian nails, I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails.
Like I said, totally normal.
Prickly Muffin Who wants chocolate chip pancakes? I do! I do! Ethan, didn't you already eat your pancakes? As Oliver North would say, "I do not recall.
" Hey, where's Sabrina? Not hiding under the table, that's for sure.
Aww Why don't you guys leave this one to me? Why aren't you dressed for school, prickly muffin? I'm scared.
Olivia told me sometimes, at school they have pop quizzes.
I don't want to pop! That's too much, man.
Sabrina, nobody's popping on my watch.
You stick with me, and I promise you, everything's gonna be just fine.
Cut, boom in the shot.
What? I'll be in my trailer.
Nah, I'm just horsin' around.
You folks enjoying the show? And how about Sara Lynn as Sabrina? Isn't she wonderful? Oh.
Thank you.
Sarah Lynn.
You remember that name.
Back to one, everybody.
Hey, you see those people? Yeah.
Well, those boobs and jerk wads are the best friends you'll ever have.
Without them, you're nothing.
Remember that.
Let's take it back to "prickly muffin.
" Your family will never understand you, your lovers will leave you or try to change you, but your fans, you be good to them, and they'll be good to you.
We are rolling.
Sound speed.
The most important thing is, you got to give the people what they want, even if it kills you, even if it empties you out until there's nothing left to empty.
No matter what happens, no matter how much it hurts, you don't stop dancing, and you don't stop smiling, and you give those people what they want.
And action.
Why aren't you dressed for school, prickly muffin? You might remember her as adorable Sabrina from Horsin' Around, but on her new dance pop album, Sarah Lynn wants you to know that she is hot to trot.
Why don't you touch my prickly muffin? My prickly muffin Ooh, prickly And it's muffin, and it's It's ready for your stuffing What is the message behind your music? America needs to know that I'm not that little girl anymore.
I'm a grown up, sophisticated woman now, and I have sex, and I do sexy things.
People like sex, okay, and since I'm sexy right now, they like me.
Are you at all worried that audiences will grow bored and abandon you for the next sexy thing? Are you kidding? I'm Sarah freaking Lynn.
I'm gonna be sexy forever! Pop star and child actress, Sarah Lynn, celebrates her 30th birthday this month, raising the question, "does anyone care about Sarah Lynn anymore?" After all, she is 30.
Here to answer that question, sexy, 14-year-old dubstep wunderkind, Sextina Aquafina.
Hey! Sextina, what's your take? I love Sarah Lynn.
I grew up on her music, okay, and she's, like, an inspiration, but now, she is old, and shriveled, and gross, and nobody want her no more, okay? They want Sextina Aquafina, baby! Ha ha! You're delightful.
So where does Sarah Lynn go from here? Oh, you know where she should go? She should go wherever famous people go when they're done being famous, and nobody cares if they live or die.
Who could that be? Who-o-o wants chocolate chip pancakes? I do! I do! Why are you talking to me? I thought maybe if I said that, you'd make me chocolate chip pancakes.
Oh, come on, buddy.
It's a beautiful morning, the sun is shining, birds are chirping Hey, BoJack, any plans for the weekend? Still hate the troops, Boj? Why don't you refill your bird feeder, huh? Yeah, who's a bird got to blow to get some seed around here? Good one.
Let's do something fun today.
Like what? Like a cannonball! Like a "buying you a new bed"? Wow, everything in this store is made out of old train tracks and a reclaimed pier.
Oh, great, for ten grand, I can sleep like a hobo.
Do we need letter openers made out of Confederate bayonets? It says they're stained with authentic Yankee blood.
O-M-G.
O-M-G! O-M-M-F-C-S-D-V-R-Q-Q-P-Q-F-G! I know.
Ugh.
Yeah, it's me, straight off your TV screens and into your shitty lives.
It's Sarah Lynn and Andrew Garfield.
Huh? What the ? And what's your name, darling? I mm I'll just make it out to "Evelyn.
" Uh Um, hi.
Sarah Lynn, hi.
BoJack? Hey.
Andrew, this is BoJack, my TV dad.
Oh, hello, I'm Andrew Garfield.
Andrew's my boyfriend.
We're a celebrity power couple.
It's no big deal.
It's a really big deal.
Sarah Lynn, I actually wanted to talk to you about that.
When we started dating, you were the biggest star in the world, but your last few albums tanked, so now, I don't even know what you are anymore.
Are you Are you breaking up with me? Oh, bother.
Um, are those candy pills, 'cause if so, that is a lot of sugar.
Why are you doing this to me?! Do you like seeing me suffer? Because you know I'll bleed for you.
Oh! Damn! Oh, dear.
Whoa-oh-oh.
Um Darling, please, I wanted to do this in a public place so you wouldn't make a scene.
You think I won't make a scene, you limey bastard? Then you really don't know me at all.
Hey, everyone! Who wants to see me take a dump on that sofa? And then she took a dump on a sofa made out of a reclaimed propeller.
Where's Sarah Lynn now? I checked her into Promises.
How did it feel to check the girl you raised on television into rehab? It was tough.
I would have liked to reconnect with her.
At least we got to bond a little on the drive to Malibu.
I can see my organs.
Oh, whoa! She is losing a lot of blood, BoJack.
Beautiful day for a drive, though, huh? Well, maybe the two of you can catch up some more when she gets out of rehab.
People don't usually want to hang out with me after rehab.
I'm really more of a before-rehab friend.
I think it's gonna be a long time before I see Sarah Lynn again.
Who could that be? Look, BoJack, I appreciate what you were trying to do, but I don't need rehab.
Look, good as new, huh? Oh, great, well, that's a relief.
Uh, should you be taking all those pills? It's dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.
I got it from a doctor.
Your doctor or just a doctor? I don't know, some doctor, okay? I met him at Adam Levine's Halloween party.
I think he said his name was Dr.
Who.
Yeah, I don't think that was Ohh, God damn.
Uh, are you supposed to be snorting it like that? Ugh! What are you, the paramedic who restarted my heart at Adam Levine's Halloween party? Okay, so before we put to bed the whole you going to rehab thing BoJack, all my life, I've never been forced to confront my problems head on.
No one has ever said "no" to me, ever, so is it cool if instead of confronting my problems head on, I just hide out here for a little bit? Sarah Lynn, I hear what you're saying, and I think I know what you need.
You just need a strong, responsible adult to say: "Yes.
Yes, you can move in with me.
" This is gonna be fun.
Hey, everyone, the old gang's getting back together.
Three little orphans One, two, three Who-o-o wants chocolate chip pancakes? I do! I do! Uh, what's going on in here? Morning, sleepy-pooh, you want pancakes? Yeah, that sounds great.
Ooh, tough break, champ.
I just gave the last one to Sarah Lynn.
Early bird gets the worm.
More like early turd gets the sperm.
Wha "Early turd gets the sperm," nice one, Sarah Lynn.
You should do a Shouts and Murmurs.
Help yourself to some cold wheat bran, sport.
Ugh.
Thanks for letting me crash here, BoJack.
The guest room is yours as long as you want.
You have a guest room? Why have I been sleeping on the couch for five years? You'll get the guest room when you've earned the guest room.
These pancakes are so good.
All Andrew ever wanted to eat was stupid lasagna.
Andrew Garfield loves lasagna? I don't want to talk about him! BoJack, can you drive me to the mall today? I really want to go shopping, but I'm not allowed to drive because somebody got a DUI.
Uh, that somebody was you, right? I don't have to answer your questions! What are you, the cop that pulled me over after Adam Levine's Halloween party? Honey, do you really think going to the mall's a good idea? I seem to recall another time you went shopping when things got pretty out of control.
Oh, that's too much, man! Oh.
Really? Not the time when she gored herself with a bayonet and shat on a floor model? Hey, I'm not the crazy one.
Andrew's the one who flies off the handle whenever his agent sets up an audition on a Monday.
Andrew Garfield hates Mondays and loves lasagna? I said I don't want to talk about it! She said drop it, Todd! Whatever, I don't want to go to the stupid mall.
I'll just tell my friends to come here.
Muffin, I've got to work on my book today, and I can't have a bunch of folks over making a lot of noise.
Oh, I see.
I'm a burden to you.
No, no, no, no, no.
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart.
I'm no longer cute, so I have nothing to offer this world.
Honey, of course your friends are always welcome here.
Cool.
Bye.
Can I invite a frien No.
You let that basket case into your house? That girl is a PR hurricane that you don't need right now.
She has nowhere else to turn.
She broke up with her boyfriend.
She stabbed herself and closed the wound with duct tape.
She fired her agent.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back it up, horsey.
Did you say Sarah Lynn doesn't have an agent? Laura, hold my calls, cancel everything! Ahab's got a white whale to catch, baby! Uh, hello? Still there? Oh, th that's that's fragile.
Uh, no, oh, no, wait.
Careful.
Careful.
Careful.
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Ah! Lemur! Great party, Sarah Lynn.
Hi, what it is, banana bread? I'm not looking for a new agent right now.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Who says I'm looking for a new client? Slow your roll, Speed Racer.
We're just two single ladies having a no-presh rap sesh.
I'm not one of those agents who can't turn it off.
Your Ari Emanuels and Vanessa Geckos and what have you.
Vanessa Gecko is actually Andrew's agent, and she's really great.
Is she? I've heard that.
I didn't realize you were so into house music.
Look, I asked her to turn it down, but apparently, this volume was prescribed by Dr.
Who to treat something called "uptight dickhead disease.
" What do you What do you think about Sarah Lynn? Oh, I don't really think about her all that much.
I mean, obviously, I'm a fan of her early work which both satirized and celebrated youth culture's obsession with sex, but I do wonder as a third-wave feminist if it's even possible for women to reclaim their sexuality in this deeply entrenched patriarchal society, or if claiming to do so is just a lie we tell ourselves so we can more comfortably cater to the male gaze.
Uh, what? But you know, on the other hand, I worry that conversations like this one often dismiss her as a mere puppet of the industry That's my same worry.
incapable of engaging in these discussions herself Obviously.
and infantilization, which is itself a product of the deeply misogynistic So deep.
society we live in.
But like I said, I don't really think about her all that much.
Okay, well, that is very interesting, but I was more asking, like, what do you think about her living here? Oh, right.
Well, what was your relationship like with her when you were working on the show? It was very good, very professional.
BoJack, where did you go to college? Don't bother him, honey.
Oh, it's no problem.
Honey, college is for ugly people who can't tap dance.
I want to be an architect.
Sweetheart, Mommy didn't do what Mommy did to that Star Search producer so that you could be an architect.
Aw.
All right, take it sleazy, everybody.
Wait, BoJack, um, what are you doing this weekend? I don't know.
I'll probably just go to the amusement park, maybe the circus, fly a kite on the beach, watch the sunset, then I'll head back to my place to watch any number of Disney princess movies while eating ice cream straight from the tub.
Whoa, that sounds like so much fun.
Can I come? Yeah, like I want to spend my weekend hanging out with a little girl.
Good one! You should write for the Shouts and Murmurs.
See you Monday! So the makeup they were putting on you was not for the show, it was just for the weekend? Why does that matter? I'm just trying to understand the story.
Do you think it's possible that you inviting Sarah Lynn into your house now is your way of compensating for not No, Diane, I'm just helping out a friend.
I'm not trying to play out some weird, sick dad fantasy, or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect, or even try to retroactively fix my own childhood by recreating someone else's, and I'm especially not doing all those things at once! Okay.
What happened? Did somebody hurt my precious baby? Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the ? Oh, hey, BoJack.
I told my friends they could tear this wall out to build a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet.
Is that cool? No, that's not cool.
Oof.
Way to harsh the vibe, Kissinger.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn could finally be Sarah Lynn, but I guess that's too much, man.
I always loved that catch phrase.
Can your friends at least take the artwork off the wall first? Ooh.
I want to say yes, but no.
Okay, good talk.
Wha Are you serious? The reason I have called this house meeting is Todd, how many times have we been over this? You don't have the authority to call house meetings.
Only I can call a house meeting.
You can propose a house meeting.
All right, fine, fine, fine, but the reason I propose this house meeting Your proposal has been submitted and is under board review.
Proposal denied.
BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing is getting out of control, okay? She's taking advantage of you.
What? No she's not.
We have a special relationship.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Oh, my God.
Look at what she's done to your house.
All right, look, I mean, I stepped on a needle earlier.
I think I'm addicted to heroin now, so now, that's probably gonna be a whole thing.
I have to say, I agree with Todd.
You're not this girl's father, and you're not doing her any favors by refusing to set boundaries.
Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV, so I think I know a little bit more about parenting than you two jokers.
The kids on Horsin' Around didn't need boundaries.
All they needed was some good, old-fashioned love.
BoJack! This is not a TV show, okay? This is real life.
Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire! Some good, old-fashioned love, and I'm gonna give it to her.
I'm gonna give it to her so hard.
You know, I feel like we don't ever hang out.
Here you are, milady, a gin and nutmeg just like you asked.
Ugh.
Too much nutmeg.
Well, you know what would taste even better? An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt.
Could Vanessa Gecko get you that? Vanessa Gecko got Andrew The Social Network, and she has skybox seats at the Staples Center.
What do you have? Well, I've got a table at the Comedy Central roast of Gloria Stein Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say we spend the day together, just you and me, away from all the haters? I want to say yes, but Great, let's go.
It really seems like Some things are forever in this world Don't you know I'm feeling fine together with my girl Daddy's girl She's daddy's girl You know, Sarah Lynn, I got a feeling everything's gonna be okay.
Uh-huh.
Hey, did you hear Kazaz got cancer? What? Herb Kazaz has cancer? Yeah, in the butt.
He's got, like, six months I think.
Well, that's horrible.
Why would you tell me that now? I don't know.
The sun setting over those two hills made me think of a big ass, and that made me think of ass cancer, and that made me think of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer.
You really didn't know? No, Herb and I aren't on the best Look, I'm trying to have a moment here.
I can't Hey, I want to give you something.
Is this your TV Guide award? It's the most prestigious award I ever won.
I always thought if I ever had kids of my own, I'd give it to them one day.
I want you to have it.
Oh, wow.
BoJack, thanks.
You're sweet.
Na-na-na-na La-la-la-la Na-na-na-na La-la-la-la What are you doing? Shh.
Just let the credits roll, let the credits roll.
Sha-na-na-na-na-na Special moment Exec Producer Garry Marshall Na-na-na Such a happy day "Sit, Ubu, sit.
" "Good dog.
" "Arf.
" Can we go home now? Yeah, okay, we're done.
Hey now, boy, come and try My clitoris is ginormous Hello? BoJack Horseman.
Did you get rid of your old TV Guide award? This pawnshop on La Cienega was selling one with your name on it.
What? Wait, why were you at a pawnshop? Oh, I just have a guy there who calls me whenever TV awards come in so I can buy 'em.
I put my name on, it's like I won it myself! I have two Golden Globes and a People's Choice forTemple Grandin.
Sarah Lynn! Hello? You still there? My clitoris is ginor Okay, party's over.
Everybody out.
Aw! Not you.
You are in big trouble, young lady.
I can't believe you pawned my award.
It wasn't personal.
I just thought your award was stupid, and I already have a billion other awards, and I wanted to get money for drugs.
Look, things have been tough for you, and I understand that.
I know what you're going through right now.
Oh, you know what I'm going through? Why? Because you were on some dumb kids show a million years ago? Hey, now.
I had my own fashion line when I was ten.
By 20, I was packing stadiums.
I get letters every day from boys telling me that I was the first girl they masturbated to.
Literally, someone tells me that every day.
That is gross.
Oh-ho, I know! You sit up here in your little house and feel sorry for yourself? Oh, guess what, Bo-J, in order to be a has-been, you have to have actually, you know, been.
You are way out of line! You're not my dad.
You're just a rugged, older man who provided me with a strong, masculine presence during my formative years.
I'm not your dad, and you're not my child.
We're just a man and a lady living in a house together, and we're both adults, and we're both a little drunk.
Who-o-o lit my ottoman on fire? Seriously, you seriously don't know? I'm a bad "widdle" girl.
Yeah, you are bad, very bad! You want me to put it out with my boob? Uh, what? Your boob is a very impractical way to put out a fire.
What is happening? I think you have a serious drug problem.
The only drug I need is horse.
Guys, guys, what are you doing? Please don't do this.
No, no.
Why are you This is a very bad idea.
Can I at least get my blanket let me get my blanket out from under Oh G Oh, my God, my arm.
You got my arm.
Ow! Ow! I'm in it now.
Oh, God, no! I'm a part of it.
I still haven't regained the feeling in my fingers.
That was the longest two minutes of my life.
Um, I think it was a little longer than two minutes.
It was longer than two minutes.
How do you not get that this is terrible? Oh, you mean from a P.
R.
standpoint? Yeah, 'cause if this got out, oh, I would get flayed! Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason.
It's exhausting.
I got to take an angry nap.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
I know.
I know.
She's taking advantage of me.
Actually, it kind of feels like you're the one taking advantage of her.
She's the one with substance abuse problems and daddy issues.
Hey, we both have substance abuse problems and daddy issues.
Yeah, but she came to you for help.
Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you, playing hard to get? Only makes you want me more.
Ugh.
Go stand on the other side of the room.
Okay.
Sarah Lynn, get your coat.
I'm taking you to rehab.
Nah, I was gonna keep hanging out here if that's all right.
No, it's not all right.
What? This place isn't good for you.
You need to go where you can get help, real help.
But I thought you were always gonna be there for me like you said.
I will always be there for you.
Cut, let's take ten.
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.
These pages are shit.
you understand? Shit.
I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages.
It would defeat the whole purpose of wiping my ass.
Phone for you.
Uh-huh.
You get me points on the back end? Well, I told you I'm not gonna do it unless I get points.
Oh, they can't find any? Well, maybe they could suck some out of my dick! I'm on the phone.
You're being very rude.
You promised me you would always be there.
Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good.
You can't stay here anymore.
Okie-doke.
I guess I'll just move out and find one of the billion people who will let me party at their house.
Uh, well, you should not do that.
Oh, I know.
I know, but I can, so I will.
I'm at a place right now where I never need to grow as a person or rise to an occasion because I can constantly just surround myself with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.
Wh-What? Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me.
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.
Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gecko, and I'm meeting with her tomorrow.
Thanks for the suggestion.
No! No, no, no, no, no! Hey, you guys want to hear my new catchphrase? Suck a dick, dumb shits! Laura, the dummy took the bait.
Now for phase two.
Is she gone? Is it safe to come out? Leak to the trades that Andrew Garfield's agent is taking meetings with his ex, get it all over town, wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew on the books for this weekend, someplace Italian.
I really blew it, didn't I? I mean, maybe you could have been a better role model when she was young, but also, she never really had a chance.
This is what our celebrity culture does to people.
So what you're saying is: Everything is society's fault, and we as individuals never need to take responsibility for anything? Uh, no.
Not exactly.
I was just saying that Yeah.
I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong because I can't do anything wrong because we're all just products of our environment, bouncing around like marbles in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos that is our random and cruel universe.
Wait, no, that's not even what I'm saying Yeah, It's not my fault.
It's society.
Everything is because of society! BoJack, that Dude, just let him have this.
Hooray! Everything is meaningless! Nothing I do has consequence! So what'd you get, anything good? Oh, I got everything.
Zoes and Zeldas And he says he says, "Why the long face?" And I say, "Hey, buddy, I can't help it.
" You get that? Long face.
Horses have long faces.
I am a horse, my face is long.
You get it, right? Good, good.
What about the Rock Hudson stuff? Felt like that flew over your heads.
Did you get that? Keep this up, and the only thing we're gonna get is our money back! Okay, okay, it wasn't that funny.
Maybe you didn't get it.
Uh, hey, guys, guys Hey, let me buy you a drink.
Get cancer, jerk wad.
You've got some good material, you really do.
The Gorbachev stuff, it's killer.
But you gotta stop asking people if they get things.
But then who do I know if they got it? They'll laugh.
Why are you giving me advice? Look, I've been doing stand-up for a year now, and it's the responsibility of big shots like me to always be looking out for the little guy.
Let me buy you a drink.
Oh, I don't drink.
BoJack Horseman.
Herb Kazazz.
Oh, God! Goddamn it, Todd, clean up your shit.
What am I supposed to do, okay? You don't give me any closet space.
Not my problem.
A better man than you once said, and I quote, "It's the responsibility of little guys like you to be looking out for big shots like me.
" Who said that? I don't know, Jesus, Ghandi, Malcolm-Jamal Warner.
Clean up your shit! Oh! Gloria Steinem, one of the leading lights of modern feminism.
You will surely go down in the annals of history just as surely as Lisa Lampanelli will go down in the locker room of the Houston Rockets.
Hey, BoJack, settle a bet.
Are you a Zoe or a Zelda? Don't know what that means.
Well, I was talking to Wayne.
Who's Wayne? I'm Wayne.
Wayne's writing an article about me for BuzzFeed.
BuzzFeed? What'll they think of next? Fun fact: Wayne is also my ex-boyfriend.
You're funny.
Pretty cool, eh, BoJack? Diane's writing a book about you, Wayne's writing an article about me.
We're the same! How could you think that that's the same? My book will be in libraries for hundreds of years.
Your BuzzFeed article will be crammed between an animated GIF of a cat falling asleep and a list of fun facts about Legally Blonde.
Ha! Classic Zoe.
I still don't know what that means.
Well, are you familiar with Mr.
Peanutbutter's House? Do you mean his sitcom that coincidentally had the exact same premise as my sitcom? Not the exact same.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's House featured a pair of twins, Zoe and Zelda.
Zelda was the sunny, fun-loving extrovert.
Look at my pumpkin, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.
Aww Whereas Zoe was the smart, cynical introvert.
My pumpkin's throwing up because Halloween encourages excessive consumption of refined sugar at a time when obesity rates are sky high.
Plus, Halloween costumes are a gateway to casual racism.
Why don't I keep the knife, Zo-bo? Who's that dog? Mr.
Peanutbutter Knick-knack, paddywhack Give a dog a bone Now, was the show's acting ham-fisted and the writing moronic? N-n-no? Yes, but the Zoe/Zelda paradigm rang true.
I believe everyone's either a Zoe or a Zelda.
For example, Nixon was a Zoe and Kennedy, a Zelda.
Al Gore, Zoe.
George W.
Bush, total Zelda.
It's R2-D2 and C-3PO, Zooey and Emily Deschanel.
So Zooey's a Zoe? No, Zooey's a Zelda.
Emily's the Zoe.
What a crazy world.
So which one are you, BoJack? I think I'm above this.
Said the Zoe.
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.
Or maybe you're the third kind of person, whose only function is to drain the energy and life force from his host organism.
Come on, BoJack.
Nah, he's right.
I'm pretty much worthless.
See? You say something to someone enough times, and eventually, he internalizes it.
The system works.
I don't have a job, I don't have any prospects.
I probably won't ever finish the rock opera I'm working on.
What? Since when are you working on a rock opera? Oh, no.
Why'd I ask that? Basically, it's Tommy by way of Cirque du Soleil set in space, with heavy erotic overtones, and the gripping psychodrama of a thriller with plenty of heart and more than a little humor.
I call it Newtopia Rising, Book 1: The Search for a New Utopia.
Book 1? You've got me thinking sequel here.
Traveling on a spaceship I'm in.
I'm out.
So far away from home To find a new and better place A planet rich with loam Loam? "Rich with loam?" Yeah, it's a kind of soil.
These people are simple, agricultural types.
On a spaceship? We learned a lot And had some laughs But they couldn't make us slaves No! No, they couldn't make us slaves No! No, they could-n-n-n't Make u-u-u-us One, two "Slaves.
" Just say "slaves.
" Sla-a-a-a-a-a-aves That was and I don't say this lightly worse than a hundred September 11ths.
Yeah, you're right.
This was stupid.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Well, guess I'll give up forever.
That's the spirit.
Now, you have to understand that as a port city, Liverpool had unique access to all aspects of American culture, especially Blues music and its unruly nephew, Rock and Roll.
I thought this story was about running into Paul McCartney in the bathroom at the Golden Globes.
It is.
I thought you would appreciate some context.
Let's skip that one for a minute.
Tell me about Todd.
Todd? What's to tell? Five years ago, he found his way into one of my house parties and never left.
And you've never asked him anything about himself? I've asked him to get a job, I've asked him to move out.
With a little encouragement, I'll bet he could really flourish.
I mean, didn't you have anyone who helped you when you were just starting out? Um, actually, no.
Todd clearly thinks the world of you.
Todd thinks the world of Pop-Tarts.
Look, I get that helping other people is not your thing, but What? I let Todd live rent-free in my stately manse.
I am his own personal Mother Teresa.
But do you let him stay here because you're kind or just because you're terrified of being alone? That is insane! I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.
Mmm if that were really true, I don't think you'd be clipping Todd's wings all the time.
What? That's unbelievable.
Todd! What? Clean up my shit? Yes, but also, I would like to help you with your dumb-ass rock opera.
What? I am supporting you.
I-I don't understand.
Oh, my God, are you dying? No.
I think you have great depth of untapped potential and I wish to mentor you in your art.
Really? Yes.
Wait, is this going to be like that time you promised to take me ice skating, and I got really excited about the ice skating, but then instead of ice skating, you left me at home so you could go to the strip club and then you took the strippers ice skating? No.
Then hooray! Let's dig in.
Where to start? Okay, well, the headline is, I hate it.
I hate everything about it.
The premise is bad and the execution is also bad.
It's an irredeemable jumble of shit.
Tough but fair.
Ahem.
That said, I don't see why we can't make something really great here.
Okay, thank you.
I'll work on that.
Are you close? No! How 'bout now? No! Now? You're not even inside of me.
Oh, God! Did you get there? Okay, so you know in the second act closer when the seekers of Newtopia are in the Turbidians' dungeon and they learn their ship has been destroyed? No.
Well, what if we move that to the fourth act? I have no idea what you're talking about, but that idea is terrible.
I hear the note.
Let me see what I can do.
And that's why this planet su-u-u-u-u-cks So? How can I put this? Imagine if the Holocaust happened every four years like the Olympics.
I would rather that happened than your rock opera.
That's not really a note.
In fact, none of your notes have been notes.
I feel like you're not even listening.
Yeah, well, you know what? Maybe I would listen if the Turbidians had some reason to enter the Cave of Swollen Dreams that didn't break the pact they made in act one with Queen Darneesa.
You have been listening.
This just doesn't make sense.
The Turbidians are a loyal people.
They they wouldn't betray their queen.
Unless They were working for Queen Darneesa, who gave them a potion that would counteract the effects of the Elixir of Failed Remembrance so they could bring the secret knowledge from the cave back to her, and then establish Newtopia as a vassal state to the Craterman kingdom! Well, don't just sit there! Get this down! Oh, you like that.
You like daddy's good stuff? Not especially.
Did you get there? Okay, what if there isn't a robot army? I think you just blew this thing wide open.
We'll make this our Newtopia-a-a # Up a fifth # # Ah # # Down a fifth # # A-a-ah # That was great! This train is moving.
Let's take a break and get lunch.
Wait, you want to get lunch with me? Yeah, that's right.
Is this like the time you invited me to lunch, but then, when I got to the restaurant, you texted me to tell me you weren't coming because you were at a strip club "eating stripper" for lunch, and also, it was my birthday? No.
Then hooray! And that was a last time I worked with David O.
Russell.
What's that old expression? "Fool me once, shame on me, but fool me twice fiddle-dee-dee.
" I do believe that is the expression.
Ooh, hold on.
I gotta take this.
Erica, I don't have time to be charmed to death right now.
So how long have you been dating Mr.
Peanutbutter? Is it serious? I'm only asking for the article.
Better question: How long does it take to write a BuzzFeed article? I want to be thorough.
What?! Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane! Do you know what today is? Sunday? It's "burritos as big as your head" day at El Taco Loco! We gotta go right now! I thought we were going to see the Diane Arbus show at LACMA today.
You know I love Diane Arbus.
I see what's happening here.
Her name is Diane, and your name is Diane.
That's not what's happening.
I can go to the Arbus show with you, Diane.
What? I've actually been meaning to go myself.
Oh, man, you guys are perfect for each other.
Why did you ever break up? Okay, less yakking, more snacking.
Let's go ride in the car! Here's your steak.
Uh, sorry.
Mm-hmm.
You mean to tell me that for a full year you were on the run from the Russian mafia? Well, a Russian mafia.
I can't believe you never told me any of this stuff.
I just thought you were a dumb freeloader who ate all my food and played video games all day.
You should have seen me in high school.
There was this one game, Decapathon.
I remember that game.
I was up for Dr.
Decapitator in the movie version.
They said they wanted someone hipper, but the part ended up going to Robert Downey.
Junior? If it was Junior, I would have said, "Junior.
" That game basically destroyed my life.
I flunked out of school, my girlfriend left me.
I mean, I didn't stop playing until my mom threw me out of the house.
I mean, that's when I first realized, you know, I'm a total screw-up.
You're not a screw-up anymore, Todd.
You're about to have a hit rock opera on your hands.
I'm really glad you think that.
I got Princess Carolyn to invite Virgil Van Cleef to our next rehearsal.
Who in the what Van? Virgil Van Cleef is the biggest name in rock opera.
Okay, think of all the great rock operas from the last 20 years.
Okay.
He had a piece of all of them.
Wow, Todd, are you sure we're ready for that? Hey, you said yourself the train is moving, but if you think we're not ready, I mean, I'll listen to you.
Hey, you've done enough listening, buddy.
Maybe it's about time I start listening.
Well, I feel like Gotta take this.
Hello? Hello? BoJack Horseman? We have some very delicate pictures you might have an interest in not getting into the wrong hands.
I am very happy with my current long distance provider, thank you.
What? Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm having lunch with my friend.
But if you just listen All right, gang, when Virgil Van Cleef gets here, look alive.
This could be Todd's big break, so clap really hard and laugh at all the jokes, even if they're not funny, but also, be careful, because a lot of things you might think are jokes are not jokes, so, you know, look out.
That was not a joke.
That was not a real laugh.
I hope you don't mind I brought Wayne along.
Who's Wayne? I'm Wayne.
I just wanted to make sure he had everything he needs for the big BuzzFeed cover story.
BuzzFeed is a website.
There is no cover.
Eh, "tomato," "tomato.
" It's "tomato," "to-mah-to.
" You say, "tomato," "to-mah-to," I say, "tomato," "tomato.
" Oh, hey, Diane, I got you something.
Oh, plane tickets? Yep, to San Francisco.
That's where the Arbus exhibit is heading next.
Oh, my God.
Thanks, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Gentlemen, dazzle me.
What you're about to see is rough, very rough.
It's a vomit pass at what might become a rock opera.
Right now, it's set mostly in space, but we're not married to that.
Todd is neither a singer nor a trained musician.
In fact, he never even graduated high school, he told me in confidence.
Keep all that in mind as you give it up for Todd.
Okay, so we start in 1887 with a young Emma Goldman.
No they couldn-n-n-n't make u-u-u-us sla-a-a-a-a-aves It needs a third act showstopper.
I had the same note.
But in all, it's spellbinding.
All right! Whoo! You know, I run a small theater in North Hollywood.
We were supposed to mount a J.
C.
Superstar revival next month, but of course, Andrew Lloyd Webber has to be a real hot penis about everything.
Oh, Andy.
Fool me once, shame on you, but teach a man to fool me, and I'll be fooled for the rest of my life.
Anyway, could this show be ready to debut in six weeks? Six weeks? Uh, damn.
Yeah, I guess so.
Marvelous! We'll schedule an investor showcase posthaste.
In the meantime, libations! Ah! Popping, what? This is great.
You know, just when you think you have a person pegged, he can still find ways to surprise you.
Yeah, Todd really rose to the occasion, didn't he? I was talking about you.
Ah, well, it was nothing.
Maybe the Zoe has a little Zelda in him after all.
I appreciate the sentiment, but I still think that game is stupid.
Hey, BoJack, do you realize what this means? I mean, if this thing's a hit, I could finally move out.
Oh, uh, you're gonna move out? You won't have to yell, "Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!" Or, "Todd, why haven't you cleaned up your shit yet?" Or, "Todd, what was the name of that guy from Perfect Strangers? Not Bronson Pinchot, but the other one?" Good, that's great.
That's great and good.
So good, so great.
Just great, and also good.
Mm-hmm.
And as you can see, progress has been swift.
For tomorrow's investor showcase, we'll have choreography and pyrotechnics for you.
This is all just happening so fast.
I don't I don't think Todd is ready for this.
Todd's not ready or you're not ready? Don't make this about me.
I've seen what happens when baby birds get pushed out of the nest too soon.
It's not your fault.
I thought he was ready.
He seemed ready.
It's not your fault.
You're right.
In these heady times, what Todd needs is an agent.
Ha! Ha! I just need you to deliver Hoo! Ha! That third act showstopper Ha! and then we'll be fully financed! Todd can do it! Todd can do anything! Can I get your autograph? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And another autograph, and initial here, here, here, and here.
Right here? And the last four digits of your social.
Okay.
So I think the big third act number Virgil wants might be a big anthem that Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy, I'm not gonna let you start on this until we stock up on snacks and Red Bull.
I do get snacky.
You think of everything.
'Scuse me, young man.
Can you hand me that Ronnie Milsap cassingle in the 10-cent bin? Sure thing, lady.
Oh, my God.
Decapathon VII? This just came out.
Todd, put it down.
Is this really only a dime? If it's in there, that's the price.
Todd, this is no time for a relapse.
Look, okay, I'll buy it now, but I won't play it till after I've written the new song.
Todd, this is a bad idea! Whoa! All sales are final.
Okay, let's see here.
I wonder if it still smells the same.
I assure you, it still smells like cheap plastic and child labor.
Okay, here we go.
Song time.
Or should I just play one game now, just to get the creative juices flowing? We both know that if you play that game tonight, you'll never leave this couch! Ah, no, you're right, of course.
Thank you.
Good night.
Come on, Decapathon, come on.
Oh, come on, Decapathon.
Oh.
Wake up! It's the morning! Damn it, Todd, the investor showcase is in half an hour.
Did you work on the song? Huh? Pull yourself together, man! Ugh! Why did the water have to come out of your mouth? Well, I'm awfully sorry to have wasted your time.
I don't think our man is going to show.
Wait! Good God, what's happened? He looks like he was up all night playing some sort of videographic game.
He's in no condition to debut a song.
Give the kid a chance, Van Cleef.
Loam, loam, loam And a uh, little room to, uh, roam And on this planet It's our home In space Rock opera? More like "schlock flop-era.
" Loam Enough! Clearly, Van Cleef has shown a rare lapse in taste and judgment.
I apologize for wasting your time with this talentless imp.
Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready for the high-flying world of rock opera or the larger world outside of my living room couch, but you know what? He's a good friend.
I don't see how that's relevant.
No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today, but you're worse off in the long run, because you're gonna die alone and unloved, you pompous, affected asshole! Mon dieu! Never have I ever! Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge.
I could still beg for a second chance.
Shut your mouth, Todd.
And you shut yours, Van Cleef, or I will buck it shut.
Suck a dick, dumb shits! Oh, that damn video game.
No, it's not the video game's fault.
I blew it.
For a second, I actually convinced myself I was more than just a worthless screw-up.
Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me chicken soup with rice.
I guess there's a reason they don't call it "the rock opera fun.
" They call it "the rock opera business.
" Guess I won't be needing this piece of junk anymore.
Hey, no.
Hold on to that.
Why don't you just put it in the living room closet? Really? In fact, from now on, you can keep all your stuff in the living room closet.
Thanks, BoJack, for everything.
This, I will get rid of.
What the Don't look at those! Those are private! Are these the notes you've been taking on Mr.
Peanutbutter? It's gibberish! Have you just been mashing keys this whole time? It's a it's a work in progress.
What's really going on here? Look, I've been following you two around for the last couple weeks, and I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that you shouldn't be with Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You should be with me.
No, I've dated you.
Sure, you're smart and sophisticated and cool, but you're also mean.
What's your article on Mr.
Peanutbutter called? The working title is, "Nine Jokes From the '90s We Haven't Stopped Laughing at.
" I knew it! Come on! Like you're not gonna tear BoJack apart in your book.
I'm not "tearing him apart.
" I'm writing a nuanced portrait of a complicated man.
Well, then, we might be doing different things.
Mr.
Peanutbutter is nice to me! He's kind and he's generous and he's loyal.
You know what your problem is? You're trying to be a Zelda but you're so obviously a Zoe.
Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.
You can live your happy Zelda life in this happy Zelda town and pretend you're a happy Zelda, but I know you, and this isn't you.
People don't change, Diane, not really.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's a Zelda.
He's happy and he's carefree and he's loving, but you and me, we're Zoes.
Yeah, I bought this earlier, and I'd like to return it.
I don't know where the receipt went.
I remember you.
You came in yesterday.
No problem.
We're Zoes, Diane.
We're cynical and we're sad and we're mean.
Thanks for your help, character actress Margo Martindale.
I don't feel good about what we did here, BoJack.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This never happened.
There's a darkness inside you, and you can bury it deep in burritos as big as your head, but someday soon, that darkness is gonna come out, and when it does, I want you to call me.
I like that guy.
Come on! Oh, is it this guy? Never travel without it.
Stop holding up the line, idiot! It's not his fault.
He's just doing his job.
It's your fault, dummy.
I'm sorry, sir, no liquid over three ounces.
This is Pappy Van Winkle, friend.
Do you know how old this bourbon is? If this was a person, I would've stopped having sex with it a year ago.
I'm sorry, sir.
Do you know who I am? Come on.
I'm actually a huge celebrity on my way to New York for an important meeting with a book publisher, who wants to publish a book about me because I am famous.
That's not Fine, you want me to dance? I'll dance.
Give me ten seconds, Diane.
This guy's being a total fascist.
Diane? Diane? Over here, BoJack.
How'd you get through so fast? I followed the basic requirements for air travel that have been in place for over a decade.
Ugh, weird.
Sir, whoever you are, please Really? You've never heard of my TV show? You know very well who I am.
And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to New York.
Ah, no.
More? Come on! Oh, you know what? Could be this.
Oh, my God, he's got a gun.
Relax, it's a lighter.
How much lighter fluid can I take on the plane? And before you answer, remember, I'm a celebrity.
We're gonna need a full body cavity search.
Thanks for coming to New York for this.
Let's just say, it's better for everyone's kneecaps if I stay out of California for a little bit.
Always nice to get a change of scenery, am I right? I think the New York air's been good for my health.
I mean, I did find a lump, but hey, who needs health insurance when you've got BoJack Horseman writing a book, huh? How's it coming along? It's great.
I'm pumping out heartfelt anecdotes and witty observations left and right, and this one is spinning it all into gold.
Your telephone is ringing.
I'm Ira Glass.
Thank you for being a sustaining member of public radio.
Everyone has a story, and your phone's story is that it's ringing.
Excuse me.
Hello? Hurry back, superstar.
I don't think Diane's working out.
What? Why? Is Diane no good? She's too good.
I don't know if Diane is damaged enough to tell my story.
She's so functional.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr.
Horseman, she's too functional.
Why don't I just get on the phone and call a less functional What are you talking about? This is a very bad time, BoJack! All right.
You need to promise me that your book will be on the shelves and making money by October! All right.
Jesus.
Uh-huh? Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Got it.
Sorry I took so long.
Who was that? The library? Thanking you for never returning a book late? That was my brother Tommy.
My dad just died.
Oh, my God.
Did we talk about firming up the release date? I was thinking late September.
I am so sorry.
It's fine, he was old and also the worst.
Such a terrible tragedy really puts everything in perspective.
Where does that leave us as far as the book of it all? Not a problem.
I just got to swing by Boston and give my condolences real quick.
BoJack can come with me.
We'll get some work done while we're there, and then that way the whole trip won't be a total waste of time.
Great.
Call me if you need anything, but hang up after one ring, and I'll call you back from the phone booth where my wife and I are living.
Todd bless these scrambled eggs Eggs from the fridge Sunny side them And guide them Todd, stop singing your dumb scrambled eggs song.
Who said that? If you're wondering who said that, it's this note that you're reading.
You're hearing my voice in your head, because that's how reading works.
Oh, yeah.
As you might've noticed, Todd, I've left you home alone for the day, and frankly, I already regret that decision.
Here's what you need to do.
Nothing.
Don't touch my stuff, and don't make a mess.
Pick me up at the airport tomorrow, and until then, don't do anything.
Well, seal's broken.
Might as well enjoy myself.
Whee! Cheers to bath time.
Great story, Todd.
I love our friendship.
Here we go! The great Toddini! And here we have the home of a truly dynamic and unique talent, TV's own David Boreanaz.
Ohh! Sounds like we have some fans of Person of Interest on board, or Castle, or whatever his show is.
Sorry, dudes, you got the wrong house.
Aww.
Crikey, I would've paid $50 U.
S.
to see where David Boreanaz lives.
He's the American Hugh Jackman.
Oh, yeah, 50 bucks? He's so good in Burn Notice.
What? 50 bucks? In that case, come on in, friends.
Some guy named David Boreanaz lives here.
Hooray! Hey, so listen, I really want to be here for you in your time of need, but I'm not really good with funerals or death or families or feelings or people.
Don't worry.
You can wait in the car.
It's probably better you don't meet my brothers.
They're narrow-minded, mean-spirited dirtbags.
I wish I had brothers growing up.
Touch football on the weekends, noogie parades on the reg.
Life as an only child can get pretty lonely.
Daddy, do you want to meet my imaginary friend? Imaginary friends are freeloaders invented by communists to rip-off welfare.
Why don't you do something productive, like bang your head against the wall until your brain isn't so stupid? Okay, Daddy.
Yeah, well, I was pretty lonely, too.
My family made my life miserable, and then they never forgave me for leaving.
So, what, you're like the black sheep? No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.
I'm just the member of the family nobody likes.
And my dad was the worst of them all.
You told me that you and your father used to sit on the roof and look at the stars together.
Oh, yeah, I was just trying to get you to open up, so I used an old writer's trick called "me lying to you.
" Oh, yeah? Well, I'm using an old me trick called "that hurts my feelings.
" And the truth is, I used to sit alone on the hill out by the dump and dream of waking up as Chelsea Clinton, but with my hair.
You do have great hair.
I know.
That's us.
I'll just pop in for a quick hi and bye.
Then we'll be on our way.
Ten minutes, swear to God.
You can play with this kaleidoscope I got you at the airport.
What? A kaleidoscope? I'm not five Shapes and colors the likes of which I've never seen.
Hello.
Hey, yeah, Deedee came home! Gary, Marty, Artie, Deedee's back! Come here! Game.
Watching the game.
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing? Marty, it's a game from '86.
You've seen it a hundred times.
And how many times does Buckner break your heart? 100 times.
Aw, thank God you're here, Deedee.
Pops is wicked departed.
Oh, yeah, man.
He departed so hard.
And I do not like them apples, Deedee.
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.
Yeah, make that two, Deedee.
Gary, Marty, I just got home.
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't want to get her brother a beer.
Hey, Ma, come look what the Pats dragged in.
Oh, hello! Look who decided to come home.
Queen Deedee blesses us with her presence.
To what do I owe the honor? Look, I'm just here to offer my condolences.
Oh, sure, in and out, like a Protestant on Christmas.
Why would you want to stick around, be with your family in their time of need? Come on, Ma.
Don't fight while the game's on.
It's bad Juju.
It's the '86 World Series.
They lose.
Ah, why'd you have to Oh, we're just a bunch of savages, right? We're not like your fancy California friends.
Your George Clooney and your California Raisins.
Oh, come off it, Ma.
She don't mean no harm.
For five years she didn't come home.
Why don't you make like A-Rod and blow.
Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.
Ah, don't go.
Deedee, please.
Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.
Ma don't know what she wants.
She wants you here.
We all do.
Ain't that right, Marty? Can't look up from the game.
Besides, we need your help organizing all the funeral stuff.
We didn't go to college.
We're not smart like you.
Fine, I'll help.
Is there a number for me to call? Yeah, try Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.
And do it quick.
The ice is melting.
Oh, my God.
Is that dad? Did someone draw balls on his forehead? That was before we knew he was dead.
We just thought he was wicked hung over.
In your face, Dad! In your face forever.
Welcome to the home of David Boreanaz, famous from television shows such as dramas on networks.
That will be $50 please.
Oy, mate, this picture of David Boreanaz fell apart.
Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle that.
Why don't you just go look through David Boreanaz's underwear drawer, okay? It's in his bedroom.
Oh, knickers.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Uh-oh, am I reading something again? No, this is your conscience.
BoJack trusted you to take care of his house.
Is this really What are you doing? Dun-dun-dun-dun Dun-dun-dun It's a great day on Todd's phone.
How can I help you? Are you trying to cut me out of this David Boreanaz deal? I'm your agent, damn it.
How'd you find out about Boreanaz House? Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here batting a ball of yarn around while you do the real work.
I want to take your project to the next level.
We need to go bigger.
Have you thought about attaching Mila Kunis to this thing? Attach her? How? You do your job.
I'll do mine.
Who is this? Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.
Diaaaaane! You show me nothing What do you want from me? You have no right to barge in here after five years and judge us, Diane.
I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand instead of sitting on the couch watching the game all day.
Ah, Deedee.
You know very well his leg's still sore from the accident at the quarry.
Yeah, he's got to rest up if he's gonna be a wide receiver for B.
C.
He didn't get into B.
C.
Ah, what's the point of getting off the couch anyway? All the jobs are going to immigrants these days.
What do you We're immigrants.
How do you figure? We're Vietnamese? Step off! We're American as fuck.
And that's the same crap you always pull What do you want from me? Come on! Excuse me.
Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane.
Does anyone here speak English? Pull over and park the car.
Is that the frickin' horse from Horsin' Around? Again, does anyone here speak English? Oh, no way What? A TV star! Boreanaz house.
Seventy-five each.
Children and seniors free.
Please stay behind the ropes and keep your hands and belongings on your person at all times.
Next we'll head to the kitchen where Is that Mila Kunis? Ooh! Note the letters B.
H.
on all hand towels and linens.
That stands for "Boreanaz House.
" Yeah, do you pick up bodies? Is that a service you provide? Corpse removal? Hey, BoJack, you ever meet any Boston celebrities? Well, one time at Bristol Farms, Ben Affleck and I did reach for the same bunch of grapes.
Oh, he eats grapes just like us? Hey, Ma, Ben Affleck eats grapes! He don't eat grapes! BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes.
He was graping it up with the Daredevil himself.
This is the greatest day of my life.
Oh! Hey, I don't suppose you boys would have any interest in maybe playing some touch football later? Are you kidding? Touch football with a star like you? That would be mad wicked pisser.
Ooh, you know what else we got to do? We got to watch the Cryane video.
Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that? No, we don't need to revisit that.
When Deedee was 16, we made up a secret pen pal for her named Leo.
Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.
We all took turns writing her letters, pretending to be this sensitive boy from Cambridge.
It was wicked messed up.
"Oh, Diane, we're two misunderstood souls.
Everyone else is a phony.
Yours forever, Leo.
" What? That is amazing.
After six months of letters, we hired a homeless guy to pretend to be Leo and take her to the homecoming dance.
Look at her.
Watch, watch this part.
I like your boutonniÃÂ¨re.
Why don't we watch this every day? Look at her face.
Now that's a good prank.
I was humiliated.
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.
It's a brothers thing, right, brothers? Whoo! That's Cryane for you.
What a pussy.
You know, it's nice that years later we can all laugh about this.
Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing.
I'm gonna go meet with the funeral director.
Any of you boys want to come? Nah, I ain't so big on funeral homes, Deedee.
All them dead bodies, they give me the jeebies.
Yeah, Deedee, why do we got to go? Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.
Come on, BoJack.
Why you got to take BoJack with you?! Boo! Boo! Boys, you have stolen my heart like Dave Roberts stole second base.
Hey! He knows our things! I must go now, but I'll see you all at the funeral, okay? And when I do, you're all getting noogies.
Funeral! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Funeral! Funeral! Funeral! And now, a very special treat just for our platinum members.
Let's take a peek at the slumbering Mr.
Boreanaz himself.
Get out of my room, Todd! I'm David Boreanaz.
Ohh! And thus concludes our tour.
Have a Boreanderful day.
Tell me about your father.
Well, he was a mean, sadistic alcoholic, who never supported anything I did and actively delighted in seeing me fail.
Hmm, I see.
Sounds like you're looking for our Piece of Shit Dad Package.
That would be too good for my father.
Hmm, I see.
Might I then suggest our Piece of Shit Dad Package Would Be Too Good For Him Package.
Yeah, that's the one.
Excellent choice.
Hey, can I suggest something? You might want to loosen up a little.
I think you could actually learn a thing or two from your brothers.
Are you kidding? If I was like my brothers, nothing would ever get done.
I'm just saying, if you can't find a way to let off some steam you're going to explode.
God damn it! Are you god damn kidding me? I keep getting calls from this unlisted number.
Ignore.
Who are these assholes? Why don't you just answer, and then you'll know? Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they? Ugh, how are we supposed to blackmail him if we can't reach him? Maybe we got to get him where he lives? You mean ? That's right, his house.
What the Whose house is this? Is that David Boreanaz? I could've sworn BoJack Horseman lived here.
Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh? You want to stop and chat, you gotta pay for the extended stay ticket.
Ah, so much, so much, so much.
Another five Gs, T-Bag, and we are in the pink.
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money, and the books aren't adding up.
Plus the men's lav needs to be serviced, and I had to fire Janine in the gift shop for stealing Boreabble heads.
I mean, how did I end up with all this responsibility? Hey, I'm not screwing around here, small fry.
You better make those numbers sing.
I don't think these offshore banks we've been using are 100% legal.
Yeah, well, my mother told me never to slap an idiot.
What? Ow! Now we're both breaking the rules.
You listen, and you listen good.
I've gotten used to a certain lifestyle since Boreanaz House went public, and I'm not going back to the old way.
Mommy likes her shoes, see? And her pearls.
Oh, I'm in too deep.
I don't know what to do.
I'll tell you what you should do.
Who said that? It's me, David Boreanaz.
Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like? Uh, sure.
Let me give you some advice.
As we say on my show I want to say, New Girl? just keep doing what you're doing, and you'll be fine.
Wow, thanks, Davie B.
Never call me that! Unbelievable.
It's 4:00.
I don't think anyone's coming.
Unbe-goddamn-lievable! All those jerk wads had to do was show up, and they couldn't even do that! Where's the body even? Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.
My goons went to pick your father up, but nobody was home.
For a nominal fee, we can scrounge up another body for you.
Would you care to peruse our loaner closet? Hey, assholes! Where were you? I planned the whole funeral, like you asked me to, and nobody showed.
Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't have wanted some stuffy funeral.
He would've wanted his body to be chopped up into chum and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.
Yeah, suck it, Jeter! Wait, what? Where is Dad? We got him chummed.
He's in the truck.
You chummed Dad? It's what your father wanted, honey, but then you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Let me get this straight.
So instead of coming to the funeral that I paid for and spent all day organizing, you had Dad's body ground into chum, so you could throw his mushy remains on Derek Jeter? No, not just on Derek Jeter.
We're gonna throw it into his fat face.
Yeah, his fat face.
In his fat face.
The Yankees are in town this week.
The planets are aligning, Deedee.
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.
Why does everything always got to be about big-shot Diane? Too good for her home.
I don't think I'm too good for my home.
Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.
Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.
She's writing a book that's not even gonna have her name on it.
You think this is how she expected her life would be going at 34? She lives with her rich boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.
She's not too good for anything.
What? Diane's a freeloader? Even I pay rent.
BoJack helping? Whoa.
This is why I told you to wait in the car! Oh, she snapped.
Here comes Cryane.
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.
Diane, you are making a public spectacle of yourself.
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.
Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.
Dad's chum is in the back.
No! No, no, no! Suck a dick, dumb shits! Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took Pops.
Oh, no, what are we gonna do? And it's a one-hopper back to the pitcher.
Easy out at first.
So what we're gonna do is nothing? Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.
Does anyone know where she might have gone? Ah, she used to run off like this all the time in high school, too.
Who knows where crazy goes? I think I know where she went.
Wait, you can't leave.
The party's just getting started.
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset, and she's got your dad.
Oh, don't go, BoJack.
You're like the fifth brother I never had.
I Really? Yeah, don't leave, bro.
After this, we'll go play touch football and do a noogie parade.
Ah, um Everyone please disperse.
This is an unlawful gathering.
Disperse immediately.
Oh, this isn't looking good, Princess Carolyn.
What are we gonna do? What do you mean, we? Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.
Ha! Mr.
Boreanaz, I presume.
Um, would you like a Boreabble head? The amazing thing is, the house looks just like BoJack's house.
They must have the same architect.
Anyway, how are things with you? Not good.
I should've known it was a waste of time to come back here.
Oh, that's awful.
Well, when you get back, I'll give you one of my patented Peanutbutter hugs.
Crunchy and creamy.
You know that patent wasn't approved, but I'll take it.
I have to go.
BoJack's here.
BoJack, well, what's he doing ? Hey.
Sorry I said all that stuff about you.
It's all true, isn't it? I found this letter back at the bar.
I think it's for you.
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.
"Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo.
This definitely isn't BoJack Horseman writing this.
" Keep reading.
"You're a good person, Diane, and that's the most important thing.
Even if no one appreciates you, it's important that you don't stop being good.
I like how you always bring your own bags to the grocery store, and how you're always organized to go places.
I like how you chew gum on the airplane so your ears will pop.
A lot of people might not appreciate that about you, but I do.
Yours forever, Leo.
" That's the best letter he ever wrote me.
Look, take it from someone with his own shitty parents, family is a sinkhole, and you were right to get out when you had the chance.
The stupid thing is, even now I still just want them to be proud of me and think I did good.
Is that really stupid? Yep.
No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
You want those guys to be proud of you? I guess I was just hoping to get some modicum of closure.
Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn't exist in the real world.
The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.
Yeah, but every time I come back here they So don't come back here.
What's great about Los Angeles is nobody cares about where you're from or who you are.
It's a superficial town where you can worry about stupid shit like keeping your pool clean, and what artisanal nuts to put on your salad.
I do like salad.
Oh, it's the best.
Why do you think people keep moving there? Thanks, BoJack.
The good news is, your dad can't hurt anyone ever again.
Uh-oh.
Gonna spend the day Over at Fenway Thank you so much, Derek Jeter.
I thought a big baseball hotshot like you would be too busy to help us old ladies across the street.
I always have time to look out for my elders, Yankee fan or no.
Is that a barrel of chum? Only at Fenway Ba-dum, ba-da-dum Um, I'll meet you inside.
I have to make a call.
Okay.
It's Herb.
You know what to do.
Hey, Herb, look, I think we have some unfinished business.
It seems like life's too short to hold grudges and stuff like that, you know what I'm saying? About life being too short? Well, of course you know what I'm saying.
You're the one with terminal I feel like I'm doing all the talking here.
So anyway, I thought maybe we could chat.
Why don't you give me a call, okay? Um so smell you later? This is BoJack.
Horseman.
Obviously.
Ugh, who keeps calling me? Come on, BoJack.
Pick up, pick up.
I'm sure he'll pick up.
It's BoJack.
You know what to do.
Huh? Oh, uh, it's a pet name.
I don't have actual honey.
Diane! Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Mwah.
BoJack Horseman! Put her there! That's all right.
I'm gonna get that handshake.
No, you're not.
Since when am I Honey? Since now.
I made up the nickname while you were back east.
Yeah, really? You made up calling someone honey? Uh, I do believe so.
Yes.
Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride? That's okay.
Todd's supposed to pick me up.
Where is he? First day, huh? Well, stick with me.
You're gonna be just fi Probably just forgot, the lazy bum.
Hey, I'll take the ride as long as it's not as bumpy as that pilot's landing.
That was seriously very scary.
Hey I'm just glad you were there, because I really would have freaked out by myself.
Be stiller, my beating heart.
Stiller crazy after all these years.
Did I miss something funny? I love funny somethings.
No, we were just laughing about this Ben Stiller article from the plane.
Ooh, he is the best.
What did it say? You wouldn't get it.
Either you read Hemisphere's Magazine, or you don't.
Hey, I might be crazy, because this is such a dumb question, and I'm embarrassed to even ask, but do I have anything to worry about with you and Diane? What? What? Get out of here.
I got to say, BoJack, that is a relief.
Ho-ho! Whoo! Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner? Or at least some road sodas, so I don't have to go through the ordeal of sobering up and then having to get drunk all over again? Oh, I actually already made special plans for just the two of us.
Oh, come on.
You're the one who's always saying you want to hang out with BoJack more, and how it's weird that BoJack never returns your calls, and how I should hang up the phone because maybe BoJack's trying to call you right now.
Uh, okay.
I guess we can make this work.
Oh.
Oh, man.
Remember that guy in 34-B? Do I? Can't stop remembering him.
Uh, hey.
Diane and I have memories, too.
This place reminds me of a cliff side meal we had one romantic vacay to Cabo.
Boring.
I wasn't there.
Can we keep this general interests? Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.
Mmm.
Oh, oh.
Ew.
There's something in my food.
Ah, crap.
Someone get the manager.
No, no, no.
Wait.
It's supposed to be in there.
Welcome home, honey.
I got you a D pendant, because I am D-pendant on you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Real Real cute.
A D for dog.
It's for Diane.
This is the sweetest choking hazard anyone's ever given me.
Mwah.
Well, how about some champagne for the happy couple.
Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.
You're too kind, but everyone knows you go off menu for the good stuff.
Yes, get me your most expensive bottle from the back.
Perhaps a 1922-ISH Heidsieck Diamant Bleu? A toast on me to Diane and Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I'd like a round of drinks for everyone.
Off the menu, of course.
BoJack, folks.
What a sport.
And while we're all in giving moods, I'd like to buy you all an Xbox, courtesy of me.
Wow.
You guys don't have to do this.
Look, I could happily go down this petty road of raising and re-raising one another.
Please do! But I'd instead like to highlight the fact that Mr.
Peanutbutter's ripping off my toast the same way he ripped off my entire career.
Uh, we prefer gifts over observations.
Okay.
Well, here's something I didn't rip off.
This brand new helicopter I just bought.
Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride in the chopper? Okay, guys.
This has been fun, and also an offensive display of extravagant wealth, but maybe we should call it a night.
What's the rush? Because I just bought the restaurant, and we can stay as long as we want.
Hey, you.
I own you now.
Do a dance.
Oops.
Oh, no.
Hey, sorry, bud.
It's all yours.
Please, you first.
Apparently, we both like to be clean.
I love being clean.
That's so coincidental.
I'm Todd.
Klaus.
Look, I know you're new here, being white, into cleansing.
I think you'd enjoy hanging out with me and the gang.
When you say "the gang," do you mean a gang? Check this out.
If you want to lift weights, we got great yard connections.
If you like toilet wine, we spent the past 20 years perfecting pruno.
The Aryan nation is number one for a reason.
Never thought I'd say this, but you put a pretty good spin on Nazis.
Hey, tell you what.
Drop by our party tomorrow.
Shoot the shit with the guys, mostly about Jews, and make up your own mind.
Until then, take my card.
Whoa.
Uh, where were you keeping that card? Forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven Guys, can we give this thing a rest? Rest? Why rest? I'm not tired.
I'm twice as not tired.
_ Or D, sex and candy? BoJack! Todd, where the hell have you been? I had to carpool home from the airport like a goddamn environmentalist.
I'm sorry, but I'm in jail, dude.
Well, you called the right person, because I need your help and you're my phone-a-friend.
Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in which two sciences? A, chemistry and physics.
B, biology and physics Oh, B! The answer's B! It's A! Damn it, Todd! This was life or death.
Same with me.
The bail's set at 50 bucks.
I'll be here wai Yes! I am the champion of the games! Did you see that, Diane? Diane? You win, old friend.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take my girlfriend to bed.
We're still out? Night, BoJack.
Good night, Diane.
Give me a bottle of something to help me forget my problems.
Ooh, maybe not that strong.
What is this, breakfast? Yeah, that's about right.
Well, that worked effectively.
It's a Holly-who-done-it as police are scrambling to figure out who stole the D from the famed Hollywood sign.
Holly-what? All of Tinseltown's at DEFCON 5 until their diabolically displaced D is demonstrably displayed once more.
Can we cool it with the alliteration? Who wrote this copy? Randy, looking at you.
Weird.
Weirder.
Why the hell would I steal a giant D? Ding-dong! It's Diane.
D D Damn! Meanwhile, local authorities are already investigating several suspects.
David Duchovny, Dick Van Dyke, DMX, and of course Dane Cook, who we all know is a thief.
Hey, D-voted memoirist.
I can't work on the book today.
Too ill.
Cough.
Are you ill, or hung-over? Because instead of coughing you just said the word cough.
Plus you left me a long, drunken voice-mail last night.
Ooh, was it bad? It was mostly a lot of wheezing, as if you were climbing something, followed by the sounds of dismantling metal, and then grunting like you were dragging something heavy at least a few miles.
I didn't say anything incriminating, did I? As incriminating as that question? No.
Good.
Well, just as a general rule, you probably shouldn't be listening to any voicemails I leave after What time do I start drinking? Noon? Yup.
See you later.
But we had an appointment.
What's that? An actor flaking on an obligation? Welcome to Hollywood.
I think you mean Hollywoo.
Did you see? Someone stole the D off the sign.
Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough.
Cough, cough, cough, cough, door slam.
What is it, BoJack? You know, I'm tied up with all my Deans today.
Kane, Norris, Winters, and Koontz, all being questioned by police.
It was me.
I stole the D.
What? Now be a good agent and make this not my problem.
How did you even? You know, your scandal-to-work ratio is, like, five to one.
Look, I need to get rid of this before Diane sees it.
Why do you care if Dia Oh, fish.
Are you in love with your biographer? What? What? Get out of here.
You stole the D for Diane.
Unbelievable.
Yeah, I don't know.
The D might be for David, because apparently when I was drunk, I printed out a bunch of pictures of David Boreanaz.
Yeah.
You did that.
Look, I'll keep your little crush busy long enough for you to get rid of the contraband, but the next three weddings I'm invited to, you're my date, dummy.
Since when to women your age get invited to weddings? I have a lot of nieces and nephews! Well, you pulled it off, you deviant.
Get it? D-viant? I got it.
Tell me, how are you gonna complete your giant bracelet? With the chain-link fence from Dodger's Stadium? No.
How'd you figure out it was me? Oh, how did I figure it out? Well, I just followed the clues, used deduction, puzzle-solving, a little bit of forensics, and also, what did I do? Oh, I listened to the voice-mail you left me saying you were stealing the D because of Diane so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D.
" Stop leaving voicemails! Admit it! You like my girlfriend.
Oh, come on.
I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure.
Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah.
Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably.
Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions.
Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure, of course, but do I like her? The answer's no.
You have nothing to worry about.
I'll cut you a deal.
I help you get rid of that D, and you never talk to Diane again.
Well, I have to talk to her, because she's writing my book.
Okay, but just don't pursue her romantically? Deal.
Ha! I knew I'd get that handshake.
I regret this already.
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.
Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.
Did we just say that Oh! At the same time? Look, I saw you talking to Klaus in the shower.
Now, the Aryan's are good guys.
Don't get me wrong.
But I don't know if you're gonna get the right attention over there.
Uh, I'd hate to get lost in a shop that big.
Now we can't offer you the works, but in the Latin Kings, you'll be a star.
We're number two, and that means we try harder.
Am I really being courted by two gangs? Oh, I feel like the belle of the ball.
So, this is the shapeless biographer I've heard so much about.
We've met several times.
Did you just call me here to insult me? What is your secret, lady? I mean, how do you get two grown men fighting over you like a foul ball at a football game? First of all, football doesn't have foul balls.
Ugh, sports.
Second of all, nobody's fighting over me.
Open your eyes.
BoJack's clearly in love with you.
Wha? Get out of here! Get out of here? Why would I get out of here? You get out of here.
This is my office.
I get the army men are police, but what's the mustard packet again? Oh, that's just a mustard packet.
It's left over from lunch.
Oh.
Well, can we move it off the table? No.
I still might want it later.
Good call.
So how do we get the D from here all the way up to here? What, with all these cops and mustards, it's gonna be a pickle.
Oh, no.
The pickle's a SWAT van, but I see your point.
Might be easier to just ditch the evidence.
But how? I I don't know.
You think these coffees would get the juices flowing.
Well, they do have Bailey's in them.
Is that why I feel drunk? Because I've had, like, seven or eight coffees.
I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas, but it's been great for camaraderie.
Couldn't agree more.
Ooh, hey.
What time is it? I probably need to move my helicopter.
It's in a two-hour zone.
You beautiful bastard, that's it! We can pick up the D with your chopper, fly it out of here, and then dump it out into the ocean.
Stupendous! Take that, the ocean.
What now, Todd? Listen.
So, kind of landed myself in a two-dates-to-the-prom situation.
The dates being prison gangs and the prom being a jump-in, so do you remember how you got out of the same jam on Horsin' Around? Ah, a classic conundrum.
Well, I recall one time on Mr.
Peanutbutter's House I think he's talking to me, pal.
You know, the guy whose show invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.
You may have invented it, but I think our show perfected it.
The only thing you ever perfected was stealing my thunder.
Stealing your thunder, eh? Now you're even stealing the words I'm saying.
You know, it's tough.
I agree with the Latin Kings on social issues, but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.
Well, juggling both never ends well.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, anything to contribute? He's just staring blankly now.
Stealing your thunder.
You could also just bail me out of here, as I said.
It's only 50 bucks Got to go, pal.
Hope it's a magical night.
All right, you ready for the plan? Oh, yeah.
But we are gonna need a big distraction to keep the eyes off the skies.
You leave that to me.
Whoa, wait.
You had a lot to drink.
You better have a cup of coffee.
Who loves you, people? Look this way, news media.
A celebrity is throwing away his hard-earned cash.
Everyone pay attention to me.
Oh, it's only one-dollar bills, folks.
Don't bother.
No, it's still free, spendable money.
This is a huge story.
Dollars are like the new penny.
Yeah.
Cash is for poor people.
What is wrong with you bozos? Just riot over the damn money already.
Well, nothing to see here, I guess.
Ooh, ooh Whoa! Jesus Christ, my ankle Oh, my God.
American singer-songwriter BeyoncÃ© is hurt.
Somebody help her! Ring the alarm.
Irreplaceable pop icon and independent woman BeyoncÃ© has been injured.
What more can you give us? Details are sketchy at this point, but we do know BeyoncÃ© is a survivor, and presumably she will keep on surviving.
But what happened? Well, Tom, I'm being told she fell on all the single dollars.
All the single dollars? All the single dollars.
All the single dollars? All the single dollars.
Bills, bills, bills.
We promise to provide live, unflinching coverage of this harrowing ordeal of a star gone from dangerously in love to dangerously in peril.
Don't stop watching.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, take her home.
Doctors have confirmed that BeyoncÃ© will never perform again.
This just in.
A break in the story of the Hollywoo heist.
We now go live to the house of Mr.
Peanutbutter, star of Mr.
Peanutbutter's House.
Ah, jeez.
What did that idiot do? Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I, and I alone, stole the D from the Hollywoo sign.
Just tell us, why'd you do it? Oh, I'll tell you why.
I did it all for my girlfriend, Diane.
Aww.
Son of a bitch.
That literal son of a bitch.
If you're joining us, Mr.
Peanutbutter has confessed to stealing the D for his girlfriend Diane in what many are calling the most romantic gesture in the history of romance and gestures.
We now await the L.
A.
P.
D.
's move.
The day they make love a crime is the day I turn in my badge.
And here's our lady of the hour now, Diane.
Diane! What do you think? Wow, Mr.
Peanutbutter, uh, it's kind of a lot.
I don't really like to be on camera.
And? Do you love anything or anyone? I got to go.
We'll talk about it later.
Ooh Oh, my Todd.
You look You look beautiful, holmes.
What? This old thing? The guards made me wear it.
Yeah, well, it suits you.
You're an autumn, bro.
Ahh.
It's good, right? Oh.
Come meet my boy, Santiago.
Uh, you know, I'll I'll be right back.
I I left my cot unmade.
Ooh, watch it.
Oh, sorry I'm late.
Hope you didn't think I was pulling an Anne Frank on you.
Good one.
Can you believe it? I was double-crossed by the one man I assumed was too stupid to even single-cross.
What? I have no idea what you're talking about.
I do have a life outside of you, you know.
Mr.
Peanutbutter took my D and gave it to Diane.
Once again, he completely ripped me off.
Oh, right.
That whole thing.
Just a minute, Cate.
Look, you may have come up with a log line, but he's the one who sold the pitch.
This is more on brand for him than it is for you.
What do you mean? Desecrated a major landmark in a drunken stupor, that's a BoJack Horseman thing.
But stealing it for your girlfriend as a grand display of affection? That's Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You're right.
It's Mr.
Peanutbutter all over.
It's the kind of bold, romantic gesture they base movies on.
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Lora? Check if anyone's bought the rights yet.
Can we keep this about me, please? Even if he stole your stealing of the D, what he made his was telling Diane how he felt from his heart.
You could never say it to me, and you still can't say it to her.
That's not true.
I can express feelings.
Nothing on the outside.
Nothing on the inside.
Look, I got to bounce.
Quick question, though.
Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun? Why are you wasting my time with this? Of course I would.
Who wouldn't? Huh.
And that's why Eva Braun was like the fifth Beatle of the Third Reich.
Wow.
I never knew neo-Nazis were so interested in Nazis.
You got some great moves, Todd.
You dance like a white man, and I love it.
Hey, no disrespect, but I got a few chess pieces I forgot need whittling.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, thank God you're back.
I was getting nervous that you left me for another gang.
If that happened, I'd have to kill you.
Thank you for rescheduling given your recent, uh, everything.
Yeah.
That was really something.
I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller? Yeah, but for some reason the jury's Stiller out on how I feel about it.
Well, that's because it wasn't for you.
That wasn't a Diane thing.
It was a Mr.
Peanutbutter thing.
Well, what would be a Diane thing? A Diane thing would be something that shows he really knows you, like giving you an iPod loaded with all your favorite podcasts, or a practical houseplant, or surprising you with a bound album of photos and emails he saved.
That's That's what the Diane I know would want.
What are you saying to me? Just that you should be with someone who knows you.
Yeah? Like who? I Whoa, were we Were we taping? Um, okay.
Uh, you want to hear my Andy Dick story? It's a doozie.
All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered.
Drugs, cigarettes.
I mean, that's the standard gang rate.
Hey, I got to go, uh, do a prison thing.
That sounds legitimate.
We are in prison, after all.
Whew.
Hey.
White people, right? Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan are you dressed like a Latin King? Uh, what What the hell, bro? Are you playing both sides? Look, guys, I didn't want to choose between you because I like you both.
Look, in fact, if you just took the time to get to know each other the way you did me, I think you'd agree we don't need gangs anymore because, deep down, we're all just people.
What do you say? This just in.
A standoff at the Super Max has turned into a full-on race war.
But first, America has fallen in love with Hollywoo it-couple, Mr.
Peanutbutter and Diane Diane? Is that you? Hey.
It's, um, me.
Look, uh, things got a bit weird earlier, so I I want to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow to talk about the time I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.
I'm really sorry about before.
I know the D was overkill, so I got you something more personal.
Aww.
I also wanted to just, um, let you know how much I appreciate you working on this book with me.
I know I sometimes get carried away, but it's because I love you so much.
You're a catch, Diane, and I think you know how much I love catch.
And I'm sorry if I've been difficult in any way during this process.
You know, it's It's really hard to have somebody, I don't know, know you, I guess.
And you do, uh, know me, Diane.
We're very different, but I think we bring out the best in each other.
It's like you're chocolate and I'm Peanutbutter? What? Now see? That was so much better than what I was gonna say.
I was gonna say carrots.
And I know I'm not the perfect guy.
I actually kind of hate myself a lot of the time.
But when When I'm with you, I, uh, don't hate myself.
I like being around you, and I don't know if I ever told you that in so many words, so I'm telling you.
Diane, I've got an important question to ask.
No cameras, no big spectacle.
Just me and you.
Call me back.
This was BoJack, by the way.
Horseman, obviously.
Will you do the honor Of becoming Mrs.
Peanutbutter? Wow.
This is happening so fast.
Yes.
I'll marry you.
But I'm keeping my last name.
You hear that? She said yes! Let's kick it! Erica, did you hear she said yes? Come on in here! All right! She's not gonna call.
Get out the consolation scotch.
It's her! Make that celebration scotch.
What's the difference? It's the same scotch! Diane! Hey, you! Hey.
So this is weird.
I'm engaged.
Oh, wow.
To Mr.
Peanutbutter? I saw you left me a voice-mail Delete it.
It's just a drunken recipe for Bundt cake.
Not important.
Okay.
I got to go.
They're about to move the D back.
See you tomorrow? Absolutely.
Well, nobody knows me like you.
Time to bring this baby home.
To think I went from flying missions over Kandahar to this cushy crap.
I spoke too soon! Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down! See, you guys aren't so different.
We're free! We're free! Yeah! Freedom! I am free! Freedom! Oh, wow.
What a twist, huh? And they say there's no new stories in Hollywoo.
You got to get your shit together.
So you took some licks, but you're gonna bounce back, because you're talented, you're smart, and damn it, you're good.
You are a goddamn American treasure, you know that? You are BoJack goddamn Horseman.
So get the hell off my lawn.
Oh.
Here I thought I was at the drive-through at Carl's Jr.
How much did I have to drink last night? Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender for the last two weeks, ever since you found out Diane got engaged to Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Diane got engaged to Mr.
Peanutbutter? I need a drink.
No.
No more drinking.
You've been out of control.
Princess Carolyn, look.
I met John Stamos.
That is not John Stamos.
Hey, Princess Carolyn, John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.
That is not your ear.
Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died.
Why? Why, God? Why did you take John Stamos? That doesn't sound so bad.
Oh, I forgot to mention you were naked for a lot of that.
Stamos! Also, it wasn't here.
It was at my office.
We thought night swimming would be fun, but the current was too strong.
Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I? No.
You made Todd your designated driver, but then you also made him drink with you.
Yeah, I'll have a western bacon cheeseburger.
BoJack, we are going to get you back on your feet.
All you need to do is get off Diane and get on to something else.
Hello? Tony, hi.
I'm calling in that favor.
Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house.
Can you be there in an hour? Yeah.
Great.
What just happened? You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.
What is Guten Bourbon? It's an urban German bourbon.
Am I just hungover, or are you talking like a Muppet? They're looking for American celebrities to talk about how much they like to drink.
It's the part you were born to play.
All you have to do is smile and stay upright.
I don't know.
It sounds like a lot of work.
You take up 80% of my time with your drama and make me 0% of my money.
Do the damn commercial.
Okay, I got to go.
You're in charge, Todd.
Keep this dummy out of trouble.
Hooray, responsibility.
Hey.
Do you really believe all that stuff you said to me earlier about me being smart and talented and good? BoJack, I'm an agent.
I believe everything I say.
Ah.
Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger? I ordered it, like, an hour ago.
Lenny Turteltaub, you skinny bitch.
How the hell are you? I'm in a hurry, so I'll make this snappy.
I got some great news about the picture we're putting together.
Sorry.
Hello? Hey, I just wanted to thank you for getting me this job and pulling me out of that oh-so-predictably BoJack spiral of self-loathing and substance abuse.
You really are the best.
I know.
Talk to you later.
I feel like you see things in me that nobody else sees.
Yep, I'm pretty great.
Got to go.
All this time, I never even BoJack, I'm in a very important breakfast right now.
Okay.
I got to go, too.
Sorry.
What's the great news? We got Braff.
You beautiful dickhead.
You finally got Zach Braff? Ah, no other director has enough weight to handle a movie about the last days of Eva Braun.
No shit, toots.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
There you go.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Everything's coming together.
With Braff directing, my client Cate Blanchett starring, and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing, this movie is a done deal.
Look, honey, I been in this business a long time, okay? Long time.
And as I once said to a young Ed Begley Sr.
, "It ain't a done deal till the deals are all done.
" I'm the best agent in the biz.
I can seal these deals with my paws in my pants.
Well, then I'll say to you what I once said to a young Buster Keaton, "What?" Laura! What's happening? We're merging.
No shit.
With what? FME.
A bunch of people got laid off, and some of the FMEERS are already moving in.
It's all so sudden and unexpected.
It was not handled well.
Oh, shit.
Don't tell me one of the new agents is Vanessa Gekko.
That slippery, slimy, cold-blooded, bug-eyed What's new, pussycat? Gekko.
In the flesh.
Ha ha.
How are you? What a morning, huh? I was in the middle of my second soul cycle class when I got the news.
Can you imagine? No.
I was so excited, I rushed home, made love to my husband of 15 years, made a hot breakfast for my three wonderful girls, read to them, dropped them off at their elite private school, and then got my ass here as quick as I could.
Um, how old are your kids now? I don't have any children.
Oh, well, it'll happen.
You're still Anyway Princess Carolyn.
I see you've already met a new member of the team.
Vanessa Gekko, sir.
I know that.
This merger is very exciting.
I'm pumped.
I'm beyond pumped.
You should be, or at least I think you should be.
It's hard to keep track of who's getting promoted and who's getting fired.
Oh.
You're probably fine or not.
Who knows? Ugh.
What do you want, Todd? Well, good news, bad news.
The bad news is that there actually is no good news, and the other bad news is BoJack's gone.
What? Where did he go? The shoot is at his house.
He just disappeared.
I don't even know why he'd leave.
This charcoal mellowed bourbon is so smooth, every time I take a sip, pure happiness.
That was amazing.
Really? Can I get you to say that in a tuxedo? Hey, I got to go.
I think this is my big break.
Don't worry.
I won't let it get to my head or anything.
Hey, who told that asshole he could sit in my chair? Don't forget I'm your agent, too! I want 10%.
Hello, beautiful.
What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be shooting a commercial.
I know, but I was sitting there drinking bourbon and They didn't give you fake bourbon on set? Oh, they did, and then I just mixed it with bourbon.
And it hit me.
Why was I so upset about Diane getting engaged? You're the one who's always been there for me, so I drank a lot more bourbon and drove over to tell you how I feel.
Oh, I see what this is.
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing? Clearly we're in love with each other.
You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.
And you're not even really in love with her.
You just think you are because you pay her to listen to you talk about yourself.
Diane getting engaged was the best thing that ever happened to me.
It made me realize you're the one I need to be with.
Ha! You say that every time something bad happens.
Not getting nominated for a People's Choice Award is the best thing that ever happened to me.
It made me realize Getting caught with that pound of cocaine was the best thing that ever happened to me.
That hooker getting pregnant was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best Every time something bad happens, you come running to me for comfort.
Well, it's not gonna happen this time.
I can't be your agent and your girlfriend.
It just doesn't work.
I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.
I have to take this.
Okay.
But remember, I'm coming for you, and I'm gonna make you love me.
Please don't.
Hey.
Bad news, P.
C.
Braff used your merger as an opportunity to jump ship.
Aw, fish.
Now his new agent's asking for twice the money.
As I once said to a young Lionel Barrymore, "Eh, shut up.
" Without a director, Eva Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.
Yep.
You got to get someone big.
What about those brothers Hello? Hello? Lady, you work too hard.
That was an important phone call.
Important phone call beep boop blorp.
Don't you robot-voice me.
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing? Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.
Before I go, I got you a little sexy something to remember me by.
Since we can't be together every second, which would be my preference, I give you cardboard BoJack.
It's got a light-sensitive sound chip, so every time you walk by it, it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire, your favorite movie.
You complete me.
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh? You had me at "hello.
" I don't have time for you or cardboard you.
I need to find a new director.
Or you could find my nude erector She's gone.
Blech.
Word to the wise, Laura Do not pitch a Nazi romance to Steven Spielberg.
Just thought you should know there's been some reorganization vis-a-vis resource management.
What are you saying? You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office until they can find her a permanent one.
The hell we are.
Also Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.
What? You said you couldn't be my girlfriend and my agent, so I'm firing you.
Now we can be in love.
Hope you like money, BoJack.
This is so great.
Now I can date you and have a better agent.
Everybody wins.
Oh.
I'm a sporting agent.
Are you still searching for happiness? Make your own happiness.
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.
Cut.
That was great.
Was it? You know, I'm trying to do good work here, really find the character, but it's pretty distracting to have all these robots staring at me with their blinking red eyes.
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.
Oh, well, you want to make a good one? Then get them the hell out of here! I'm the face of this brand, I'm the man behind the thing, and I'm determined to get the jargon of this German bourbon blurbin'.
Is it just me, or does this fake booze taste a lot like real booze? You want BoJack, you can have him.
Here's a list of directors who won't work with him, studios that won't hire him, former assistants with restraining orders.
This is great.
You know, it gets kind of boring when all your clients are in such demand, they practically find their own jobs.
Well, then BoJack should be a lot of fun for you.
No one wants to hire him.
Hello.
We're looking for BoJack Horseman's agent.
We'd like to discuss a very lucrative business opportunity.
You gotta be kidding me.
I'm BoJack's agent.
The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.
Ha.
All yours.
Needless to say, it would be a shame if these pictures got out.
Fortunately, that can easily be avoided by simply paying me and my partner here $150.
Each.
Let me just get my checkbook.
Huh? Whoa.
Oh, except California law prohibits taking photos on private property without a permit, but you had a permit, right? Uh What's that? Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted as a class E felony.
That's four years in prison, easy, and when you throw in the murder of Tupac Shakur We didn't do that.
Yeah, yeah.
You can't pin that on us.
Well, someone's got to take the fall.
Sorry to bother you.
Forget we were ever here.
That was fun.
Hey, Laura, send those guys a nice fruit-and-nut basket.
You got it, boss.
Who said you could use my assistant? I did.
Oh, hello, Mr.
Witherspoon.
Did you know the human head weighs 8 pounds? Fascinating.
So sorry we have to double up on everything while we work out who goes where and who gets fired, but in the meantime, help yourself to an intern, one of the rising stars at our company Charlie Witherspoon.
Hello.
I Oh.
Sorry, my My hands are really sticky.
Oh, God, am I blowing this? Charlie was the editor of The Harvard Lampoon.
He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant while I use Laura.
Ugh.
Good thinking, boss.
Ah, ah, phone is ringing.
Phone is ringing.
What do I do? What do I do? I'll take it in here, Charlie.
Hello.
Princess Carolyn, your client is out of control.
BoJack is not my client anymore.
Not BoJack.
Todd.
I think someone mixed alcohol into his prop drink.
Oh, you pretenders.
Bourbon is the name of a county.
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.
That would be like making Rice-A-Roni anywhere but San Francisco.
No, no, no, no, no.
Ugh.
I'll be right there.
Ow.
You got to get your shit together.
You are a winner, okay? You are Todd Hold on.
Fish.
Okay, you are Todd goddamn What's your last name? Chavez.
Your last name is Chavez? Yeah.
Why? I don't know, I just never thought of you as a Chavez.
Look, I got to go.
I feel like you didn't really finish the pep talk.
I know, but I got a movie to put together.
Best of luck.
Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.
What the heck is going on? "The woman who loved the man who hated everyone.
" That writes itself.
You got to be kidding me.
Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.
You're having the Eva Braun meeting without me? I'm so sorry, but I didn't know what the protocol was around here, and these guys were just champing at the bit.
We're just wrapping up.
But Cate is my client.
Okay, why don't I come find you when it's over, and I'll bring you up to speed? Is that Quentin Tarantulino? Yeah.
I brought him on board.
You know he's always wanted to direct a romantic comedy? Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.
Bye.
We live in a cynical world, a cynical world.
He's right, you know.
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate.
Hey.
I just missed an important meeting because I was babysitting Todd, who's too drunk to work, because you switched out the prop bourbon with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.
Have dinner with me tonight.
No way.
Come on, just me, you, and a bottle of Pinot.
Probably more than one bottle and some entrees.
And I'll probably get an appetizer.
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.
I have to work.
You don't have to work.
You choose to work.
Hmm.
Why not choose to be happy for once? Mm.
When you're writing a memoir, you spend a lot of time reflecting on the past.
I regret not being a better friend to you and lover.
Thank you.
Lover's kind of a weird word, but thanks.
You want to get out of this stuffy old restaurant, get some gelato, and maybe drive out to the ocean and put our feet in the water? That sounds great.
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.
Great.
I'll get the car and meet you outside.
You scamper right back, pussycat.
You look at your reflection too long, you might fall in love.
She's gone.
What do you want, Gekko? Well, I was hoping to talk to you face-to-face, but I guess you had to leave work early.
I left at 8:30.
What is it? Well, Cate and I had a really good talk today.
We have so much in common, and especially since I'm doing so much for Eva Braun, it almost seemed weird that I wasn't repping her.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
She and I are both high-powered working mothers, so I understand her priorities, so she's switching to Gekko.
Wow, being a mom helped my career? I really can have it all.
This isn't fair.
I know everything about Cate.
Her favorite color is red.
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.
I know all I need to know, which is that she's beautiful, she's British, and she's gonna make me a lot of money.
She's Australian, you moron.
If you need me, I'll be at work.
Bye.
Bye.
Ugh.
Uh, telephone.
Charlie, get me Cate Blanchett.
Um, who is Okay, I don't Uh, uh, sorry, I can't Oh, sticky.
You know what? Never mind.
If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate that bad, she can have her.
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be happy.
Tonight, I choose to be happy.
Hello? I think I put you on mute.
Good night, Charlie.
Holy shit.
Herb! How the hell are you, buddy? Ruin any lives lately? Excuse me? I got your message, asshole.
You got something to say to me, you come out to Malibu and say it to my face.
I'll be alive tomorrow.
After that, who knows? Sorry that took me so long.
Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.
Hey, um, I just got kind of a weird phone call.
You and me both.
Hey, screw 'em all, right? Yeah.
Are we going to gelato? Princess Carolyn, what are we doing? Getting gelato? This was a mistake.
I've been acting crazy.
That phone call just pulled me back to reality.
You were right.
I don't love you.
You don't love me.
We're just two lonely people trying to hate ourselves a little less.
Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.
Maybe that's all we ever were.
Well, this night took a turn.
You know the worst part? I knew this was gonna happen and I let myself get excited anyway.
So we agree that this is on you, then? I guess I'll see you around.
You're not even gonna give me a ride home? Sorry, I think I just need to be alone right now.
Of course, of course.
That's what you get when you fall for a horse.
Taxi.
You got to get your shit together.
So yesterday, you let yourself fall in love a little bit, and you got your heart broken.
Serves you right for having feelings.
Starting now, you are a hard, heartless career gal.
Go to work, be awesome at it, and don't waste time on foolish flights of fancy.
From now on, you are a robot.
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.
Hello.
I just want you to know I'm fine.
Uh-oh.
People only say they're fine when they're not fine.
Did I hurt your feelings last night? I'm an agent.
I don't have feelings.
Well, I'm glad you called.
I think that you had the right idea yesterday.
I should be getting back to work.
Can you get me another job? Yeah, well, I'm not your agent anymore, so, no.
Oh, right.
Well, just tell whoever, then.
Haah! Whoa.
Asshole! Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.
He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing.
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.
Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb? You must be really Nope, don't care.
Not interested.
Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie, because that's all we're gonna do today.
My tie got stuck in the copier this morning.
That's great, Charlie.
If you flip them real quick, it looks like the tie is running.
Hey, Vanessa, your client, BoJack Horseman, wants a job.
Good luck.
Oh, yeah, about that.
Gwyneth came in this morning, and I wanted to show her that she was a top priority, so I shredded BoJack's contract right in front of her.
Heh heh What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.
I say good riddance to Mr.
Houseman or whatever that horse's name is.
It's not like he makes this company any money, and he does seem to take up an awful lot of your time.
I'm from Arizona, Jerry.
I went to Arizona State.
Todd, how do I turn this thing off? Todd.
What? I'm busy.
Never mind.
Think I've figured it out.
Now that I've got the room to myself, time to practice the trombone.
He's kind of in a bad place right now.
You can't just drop him.
The best agent in this building couldn't get that guy a job.
The best agent in this building got him a job yesterday, and I could get him a feature by the end of today.
If you want to get him a movie by the end of the day, great, do that.
Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him.
Charlie, I hear NBC picked up your running tie show.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Dad.
Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here.
How'd you like to work with the BoJack Horseman? What's that? You hate his guts? What's that? He's a talentless boob? What's that? You'll never work with BoJack again? What's that? You want him to die in an ass factory warehouse fire, smothering to death under a pile of burning asses? Well, if you change your mind, give me a call.
Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you? I don't understand why you're going through all this trouble for him.
That guy's dead weight, Princess Carolyn.
If you don't cut him loose, you're never gonna be happy.
Help me help you.
That's it.
Of course.
Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch.
You know Jerry Maguire's my favorite movie of all time? All your films are so human, which is super impressive since you're a crow.
Well, my name is Cameron Crow, but I'm actually a raven, so common misconception.
Well, whatever you are A raven.
I brought you this Suffragette City "a coming of age story about rock music, being a teenager in the '80s and buying zoos"? How have I not heard of this book? You'd be the perfect director to make a movie out of it, and I happen to know this is Cate Blanchett's favorite book.
I'll bet she'll drop everything to play the part.
You should give her a caw.
Okay, I see Yeah.
Caw is what crows say.
Again, I am not a crow.
Cate, listen to me, you're making a big mistake.
Eva Braun is your dream, remember? Cate? Hello? Cate! Oh, no.
What happened? Did Cate drop out of your little Holocaust movie so she could make my little Cameron Crow movie? Why don't you go home and cry about it to your loving husband and children? Say, which one of you is overseeing the Eva Braun package? That would be me, sir.
Vanessa, you really shat the bed on this one.
Now, are you fired? Not exactly.
Can you still work here? No.
Lenny Turteltaub here to see you.
Thanks, Laura.
So, one minute I'm making a movie with Cate Blanchett.
Next, I hear she's doing a picture with Cameron Crow about mix tapes.
As I said to Ed Porter at the premiere of The Great Train Robbery, "Aah, the train's coming right at me.
" What the hell is going on? I don't know, Lenny.
Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.
All that work for nothing.
Now Quentin Tarantulino's got four arms up my ass 'cause he got all excited about making a rom-com.
You know what would be a great romantic comedy? Remember when that guy stole the D from the Hollywood sign so he could propose to his girlfriend? That would make a great movie, but who would play the lead? Preferably someone kind of washed up.
You know how much Quentin loves to revitalize dead careers.
It's kind of his thing.
Well, in that case, you know who'd be great? Show me the money.
Yeah.
Good news.
You're back in my stable, and I got you the lead in a romantic comedy.
Who's the best agent in the world? What? I went through hell and back today, but it was worth it because I got you a job.
Aren't you excited? No.
I don't know.
I don't care about that.
You You said you wanted a job.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
Wow.
What happened in Malibu? I got to go.
Need anything else? No, thanks, Laura.
Go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Are you gonna head out soon? Where else would I go? Happy birthday, Princess Carolyn.
Thanks, phone.
You are 40.
Oh, right.
Well, just tell whoever, then.
Haaah! [tires screech.]
Ooh! [honks horn.]
Asshole! [tires squeal.]
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.
He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing.
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.
Oh, my God.
You're going to see Herb? You must be really Nope.
Don't care.
Not interested.
[phone beeps.]
Okay, Good talk.
Hey.
Ready for this? Listen.
I want to make sure I don't spend any time alone with Herb.
I'm bringing you along as my buffer.
And your memoirist.
I should meet your old best friend before he dies of cancer.
Fine, I guess.
Just don't abandon me.
No bathroom breaks.
And don't slip out of the room to text your fiancÃ© a bunch of winky smileys with hearts next to them Gross.
Congratulations on the whole being engaged thing, by the way.
Thanks.
It's just starting to hit me.
I'm getting married.
Thank God I don't have to die alone.
No offense.
None taken.
Till you said, "No offense.
" So what's the deal with you and this guy? You never talk about him.
Well, I kind of, maybe stabbed him in the back.
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.
A story of power, betrayal, and ambitious hairstyles.
The year? 198 Movie's over.
Watch the next one.
Aw, I'm tired of watching movies.
Do you want to play a game? Sure.
I spy with my little eye someone who needs to shut the hell up.
Is it me? It's always you.
Now, where was I? You were about to tell a story about you being a shitty friend, but then, we got interrupted by you yelling at Todd.
Oh, yeah.
Shut up, Todd.

[laughs.]
BoJack, you're late.
Here.
I got you a beer.
It's on the house.
Don't tell my boss.
Thanks, Charlotte, but one beer gets me tipsy.
I got to be clear-headed for my set.
Looks like Herb's killing.
Yeah, and the suits from ABC are here.
[laughter.]
Look.
They're nodding.
That's the executive version of laughing.
Wow.
They must be serious about Herb.
That's Angela Diaz.
She's the woman who made pantsuits a thing.
Oh, before I forget.
Herb and I are gonna see Back to the Future again this weekend.
Want to come? I'm in.
That movie was amazing, except for all the lame time period jokes.
We get it.
The '50s were different.
I'll have a New Coke, please.
Listen, you guys don't need to include me on your dates.
Sometimes, it makes me feel like a third wheel.
BoJack, stop.
Without the third wheel, how would you ride a tricycle? Wouldn't that make it a bicycle? Herb Kazzaz, ladies and gentlemen.
[applause.]
Hey-ooh! Great set, man.
It's like everything you said was something I've thought before but never had the balls to say.
Thanks, BJ.
I set 'em up.
Now, you knock 'em down.
Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman.
[applause.]
Well, thank you, Bubbles.
I love L.

Don't you guys? The prettiest girls in the world flock to this city, and they end up with total knobs.
Take this couple, for example.
[laughter.]
Excuse me, miss.
Is that your date? He's my husband.
That's your husband? You can do better.
Give me a call after the show.

I'm just kidding around.

I got another audition this afternoon.
God, I can't wait till I'm finally up for real jobs instead of these dumb commercials.
"Here's the thing about most long-distance plans.
" Ugh.
I hate when people say that.
"Here's the thing.
" It's so stupid.
Just say the thing.
You don't need to introduce the concept that there's going to be a thing.
I don't expect to be offered Secretariat right away, but when am I gonna be up for real roles? We'll get there, BJ.
We both will.
In fact, if I play my cards right, I might get there real soon.
Wait.
Did the guys from ABC call? Uh-huh.
They invited me to some hotshot event at LACMA this weekend.
I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show while they're drunk.
An off-the-clock, non-work-related social event? That's the perfect time to pitch a TV show.
You're brilliant.
These people are so fancy.
Look, look, look.

Hey, you mind if I steal this superstar for a second? Okay, yeah.
I'll catch you two later.
Stay out of trouble.
Oh, ho.
Well, there he goes.
Herb's about to hit the big time, and I'm just gonna be a small-fry doing tiny commercials and eating mini quiches.
You're dead wrong.
You're gonna be a big success.
Herb says that to me all the time.
He thinks the world of you.
He does? Yeah, I'm not worried about if you'll become a star.
I'm more worried about how you'll change when it happens.
Like, you think I'll get fat? No, that's not what I'm talking about.
So you're saying I definitely won't get fat? No.
Well, make up your mind, lady.
Look over there.
See those tar pits? Hollywood's a real pretty town that's smack on top of all that black tar.
By the time you realize you're sinking, it's too late.
Wait, is this a science lesson? No, BoJack, it's a metaphor.
Ugh, that's worse.
BoJack, I'm moving to Maine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Really? Does Herb know? Yeah.
I don't think I'm the person Herb's looking for.
I'm going to miss you, Charlotte.
Hey, do you ever wonder what would have happened if you'd met me before Herb did? Would you have made a move on me? Charlotte I don't think you would have.
You know why? I think you're a coward.
Now go stuff some prosciutto in your pants before that Webster kid takes it all.
[upbeat music.]
[Herb.]
I love this town.
Why did you bring me to Griffith Park? Are we gonna get in a knife fight like in Rebel Without a Cause? I hate that title.
He had several causes.
I wanted to give you this.
Look out at that city.
What do you see? Wow, I didn't realize there were so many day hookers.
I see a city that you and I will run someday, and when we're both famous and have everything we've ever wanted, we'll come back here together and high five.
I'm not fully on board with this new high five thing.
What ever happened to the low five? Give me some skin.
BJ, listen.
I got a call from ABC today.
They bought my TV pitch.
What? That's amazing.
What's the show? It's called Horsin' Around.
Well, good luck on your rocket ship to the top without me.
No, BoJack, the show's about a horse, and I told those suits if they want my show, then that horse is gonna be BJ Goddamn Horseman.
Oh, my God.
And they said, "No.
" Oh.
And I said, "Please?" And they said, "Okay.
" So, what do you say? Want to be my star? Seriously? Of course I do.
Of course, Herb.
Jesus Christ, thank you.
Mm-hmm Whoa, whoa.
I think you got the wrong idea here.
Yeah, no, man.
Whoa.
Herb, I'm not Me either.
No, I just You know, I caught up in the moment.
Yeah, no, I gotcha.
BJ, can you believe it? We're gonna make an actual TV show! One that takes an unflinching look at the gritty reality of the American family.
Just kidding.
Let's get rich! [both.]
Yeah.
[rock music.]
Generic '90s grunge song Everyone in flannel Generic '90s grunge song Something from Seattle Why would I say, "You'll never get me in that sweater" in this scene and then, in the very next scene, I'm wearing the sweater? Did my character suddenly forget that he didn't want to wear the sweater? No, see, that's actually the joke.
Don't explain the joke to me.
I just don't understand how it's a joke.
So you do want me to explain it to you? I want you to add a scene showing how I changed my mind about the sweater so the goddamn episode makes sense.
Look at me, doing your job for you.
Way to go, Shakespeare.
BJ, you're doing the scene as written.
What happened to the stories I requested? Where's my rap? You said you'd write me a rap.
We're working on it.
We just need a rhyme for "and I'm here to say.
" Well, what about giving me Rollerblades? How are people gonna know that my character is hip if he doesn't roll the blade? Just get out there and do your job.
Every one of your ideas is stupid or racist.
That was one pitch, and I didn't say they're all thieves.
But if you're too scared to start a national dialogue, maybe I'll take my ideas home.
Good luck making Horsin' Around without the horse.
BoJack, hon.
That audience out there traveled from all over the country just to taste some of your magic.
Do you really want to disappoint them? [sighs.]
Okay, Sharona.
I'll go out and jerk this limp script until it gets hard, but I'm not doing it for Herb.
I'm doing it for the fans.
And your 30K an episode.

You guys sound like you're ready for a show.
[rock music.]
Oh, gross.
Why do I keep trying to like Zima? [phone rings.]
Talk to me, world.
BoJack, it's Princess Carolyn.
How are you doing today? Well, I'll tell you my problem.
I just keep getting handsomer.
[laughs.]
Good problems to have.
Hold for a sec.
I've got your agent on the line.

I got some news so good, you'll goddamn kiss me.

She is attractive.
Good God, when I die, bury me in Kathy Ireland.
Uh, Marv? Marv? What's the big news? Secretariat! It's happening, and it's down to you and Val Kilmer for the title role.
That's amazing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, listen.
I don't want to see you in any more tabloids.
Keep your head down and your nose clean.
Now, I gotta go.
I got a lunch with MC Skat Kat.

Scandal breaking today surrounding the family sitcom, Horsin' Around.
Oh, God.
What did I do this time? Herb Kazzaz, the show's creator, was caught tonight in an LAPD sting on public indecency.
Wha Police say Mr.
Kazzaz was caught in the middle of lewd acts with another man.
Conservative groups have been quick to organize.
Horsin' Around is a show for kids.
My family should be able to watch those nubile preteens without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting their alternative lifestyles and ruining America.
Sheeeiiiiit.
BoJack, I gotta tell ya.
I'm gay.
No doy.
I know we haven't been close for the past couple years.
Okay, I'm gonna hold back my "No doys" because there might be a lot.
But you know me, right? You know that I'm a good guy.
They're gunning for me at the network, and if I get kicked off this, I won't recover.
I need to know that you've got my back.
If you threaten to walk, they'll listen to you.
Herb, you picked the worst possible time to Hey, you know I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it.
Come on, BoJack.
How'd we get so far apart, huh? [sighs.]
You know what? You can count on me, Herb.
I mean, I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for you.
I knew it! I knew you'd come through.
And when this is all over, we're going to drive back up to Griffith Park.
I still owe you that high five, right? Hey, this is a dumb question, but do you guys ever, like, all link up together and do, like, a party train or a fun circle? 'Cause I feel like I'd be doing that all the Never mind.
Stupid question.
Feel stupid for asking that.
[crowd shouting.]
[barking.]
Go right ahead.
And then it goes, "I like healthy gums in a major way.
" See, that's what I'm talking about.
That's great.
We just gotta make sure that we work in the phrase "toothbrush rap" early, so they know I'm rapping.
BoJack, can we chat for a second? Ugh.
Here we go.
It's the big one.
I'm not gonna waste your time with small talk because you work for me, and your time is my time.
We're letting Herb go.
You can't do that.
"I can't do that.
" I'm not asking you.
It's nothing personal.
I like Herb.
I think he's a good guy.
But this is a business, and every day we don't fire him, we're flushing money down the crapper.
Well, if he goes, I go.
"Well, if he goes, you go.
" I wouldn't do that.
BoJack, I think you're a star, and sometimes being a star means making tough choices.
You can storm out, make a big show out of what a "good" friend you are, or you could be the guy who does his job.
Angela I'll tell you when it's your turn to talk again.
Look, you're a star, but this is really just the beginning of the BoJack Horseman story.
You can choose whatever path you want, but I'll tell you right now.
You don't win awards and you don't get to be on the covers of magazines and you don't get to play the lead role in the Secretariat movie by being a good friend.
What's that old expression about how the show must go on? Oh, right.
It's "Don't be an idiot.
" So what do you think, BoJack? That's a courtesy question.
I already know what you think because I have conversations like this one five times a day.
I know who you are, and I know you've already made your decision.
But if you want to surprise me, now's the time to do it.
That's what I thought.
You're doing the right thing.
I know it's hard.
But if Herb's really your friend, he'll understand.
Now, you've got a show to put on, so I'll let you get ready.
This was a good conversation.
Productive.
If you're lucky, I'll never talk to you again.
[cup thuds.]
[sighs.]
[announcer.]
You folks ready for a show? [audience cheering.]
'Cause I think a certain someone might show up any second.
[applause.]
[sighs.]
[cheers and applause.]
Wait a minute.
This isn't the bar.
I gotta fire my assistant.
[laughter.]
So what ended up happening with Secretariat? Went into turnaround.
I don't totally know what "turnaround" means, but they never made the movie.
Whoa.
This house is way bigger than yours.
Herb's done really well for a guy you dicked over.
Oh, no.
Ah.
That's enough out of you.
Stay out here and turn this car around in case we need to leave in a hurry.
Hooray.
A task.
[doorbell rings.]
[sighs.]
[coughs.]
BoJack! Well.
Jesus, you look shitty.
Have you been eating your guilt this whole time? [all laugh.]
Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself, Herb.
I have cancer.
And hello.
Who's this stunning creature? And what string of bad decisions has placed you in BoJack's orbit? Uh This is Diane.
She's writing a book about me.
Pleasure to meet you.
Is your book called, Portrait of an Asshole? [laughs.]
I kid.
It's funny, because he ruined my life.
I joke.
It's what I do.
Please, come in.
You're letting out all the cancer.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! [forced laugh.]
Ha ha Almost.
Ah Almost there.
Come on ah.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
[bear growls.]
BoJack, how are your utensils? Uh, they're fine.
Are you sure? Because if that knife ain't sharp enough, I got another that you left in my back 20 years ago.
[laughs.]
Could have seen that coming.
Who asks about utensils? I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Nope.
No, you are not.
Uh.
Oh.
Ow.
Almost.
[exciting music.]
Drive, drive, drive! Oh.
Oh, no.
I can't turn the car around.
I've been trying to do this three-point turn forever.
I mean, it's more like a 300-point turn.
Am I right, huh? Hee hee hee hee! Hey, we've got two sacks of Kardashian swag and the fuzz on our heels.
You think this is Driver's Ed, you hat-wearing pussy? Drive the goddamn car! [coughs.]
Hey, Herb, is that your Vitamix? BoJack has one, too.
I wonder if you guys have strong opinions about it one way or the other.
Well, the stupid thing was like 600 bucks.
I have used mine a grand total of zero times.
I got it a month before I was diagnosed with cancer.
I don't give a shit about being healthy anymore.
I don't even have cancer, and I don't use it.
So who's it for? Exactly.
What is so great about liquids? Every article I read now is "juice this" and "juice that.
" You know why? Juice controls the media.
Hey-ooh.
[both laugh.]
Can't this thing go any faster? Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.
[tires squealing.]
Do you want me to get out? Try to guide you? No, I think I'm almost there.
You're doing a great job.
Kenzie, stop talking to him.
Why? He's being nice.
Remember the number one rule of the Celebrity Stealing Club "No falling in love.
" Ugh.
That's your rule for every club.
It's a good rule.
Whoa.
Whoa, guys.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
Maybe we should take our masks off and actually talk.
You want me to take my mask off? Fine.
Happy? I took my mask off.
Did you? Because I think you're still wearing a mask.
[both.]
Oh.
Oh, my God, Herb, you met President Clinton? Oh, yeah.
Many times.
Did you think that I spent the last 20 years on my couch just feeling sorry for myself? I mean, I did do that, but I also started [coughs.]
a charity to bring clean water to millions of children in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Oh, wow.
I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.
Wait, is that Charlotte? Yeah, yeah.
We kept in touch.
You should actually give her a call.
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.
She looks good for someone so old.
She's three years younger than you.
Exactly! [laughs.]
[coughs.]
Er? Well, guys, I'm pretty beat.
I think I need to head off to bed, and I hope I actually wake up later.
[coughs.]
And it was actually nice to see you, BoJack.
You can see yourselves out.
[chuckling.]
"Juice controls the media.
" [chuckling.]
I love it.
So I guess in a sense I'm running away from the cops, but I feel like in another, truer sense, I'm running away from myself.
Truth.
Truth.
Whoa.
Kenzie, do you have anything to share? Just how amazing it feels to finally be honest for once.
I could live a million lives, and I'd never forget this one afternoon.
Word.
You know, I act all cool and sophisticated on the outside, but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know? But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally ready to let my guard down.
Do you hear that? He's letting his guard down.
Let's get him! [grunts.]
Oh! [both.]
Celebrity Stealing Club strikes again.
[upbeat music.]
This This just doesn't feel right.
I should have brought a bottle of wine.
That's what adults do.
BoJack, damn it.
Is that what's bothering you, that you didn't bring wine? You're right.
I just would have drunk it on the way here.
This isn't about wine, BoJack.
If you have something you need to say to someone, you should do it while you have the chance because before you know it, it'll be too late.
Is this one of those things where we're talking about Herb but we're actually talking about something else? No, I was talking about Herb.
Okay, good.
Yeah, me, too.
[cheerfully.]
Hey, buddy! You come back for that Vitamix, you [coughs.]
Ooh, you should get that looked at.
Yeah.
I've been meaning to see a doctor.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about you know.
I feel bad about what happened.
So you're apologizing.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't forgive you.
Herb, I said I'm sorry.
Yeah, and I do not forgive you.
Uh not sure you get what's happening here.
This could be the last time that you No.
I'm not gonna give you closure.
You don't get that.
[coughs.]
You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life.
You have to know that it's never, ever going to be okay.
I really think that we'd both feel better if we just I'm dying.
I'm not gonna feel better, and I'm not gonna be your prop so you can feel better.
You have to believe me.
I did everything I could.
Yeah? Then why didn't you call me? Huh? Look, I I wanted to, but I didn't think You know what it was like for me? I had nobody.
Everybody left.
I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me.
Sure.
But you? It's not my fault you got fired.
I don't care about the job! I did fine.
I had a good life.
But what I needed then was a friend, and you abandoned me.
And I will never forgive you for that.
Now, get the fuck out of my house.
I [sighs.]
Hey, this is a dumb question, but the gay thing and the rectal cancer thing aren't related, are they? Get out of here! Never mind.
Stupid question.
Forget I brought it up.
Huh.
Hey, BJ.
Put that back, asshole! No, you gave this to me.
[growls.]
No! [both grunting.]
[Diane.]
BoJack? What are you doing? Get off him.
The show was never the same after I left.
Admit it.
Some people prefer the later years.
[growling.]
BoJack.
Come on.
[panting.]
Thank you for inviting us.
You have a lovely home.
You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy.
Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you're not.
In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish goddamn coward who takes whatever he wants and doesn't give a shit about who he hurts.
That's you.
That's BoJack Horseman.
I don't know why I came here.
Yeah.
You do.
[engine revs, tires screech.]
[Princess Carolyn.]
You said you wanted a job.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
Wow.
What happened in Malibu? I gotta go.
[phone beeps.]
Hey, bright side.
At least now you have a good story to tell at his funeral.
Ugh, God.
I'm not trying to kill the vibe here, but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.
[sighs.]
Look, I won't put what happened today in the book if you don't want me to.
No, it's okay.
Full truth like we agreed.
Warts and all.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I don't even care what anybody thinks anymore.
Well, for what it's worth, I think it took a lot of guts to do what you did back there.
[water lapping.]
Mmm Mm! [melancholy music.]
So should we talk about how you just tried to kiss me? No, I don't think we need to talk about that.
Yeah, you're right.
What's to talk about, right? We're f-friends, right? Oh, yeah, totally.
Yeah, friends.
And I think it's important that we stay friends.
Yeah, I agree.
And be friends with each other.
Yeah, friends.
And also to each other.
Plus, hey, you're getting married.
That's right.
Next summer.
Nantucket is great in the summer.
Not like L.
A.
, which is so hot and dry.
It is arid.
Well see you later! We're still a few miles I'll walk.
It's a beautiful night.
Ah! Sorry, sorry! Shit.
Todd, we gotta stop this wedding.
Todd? Aw, crap.
I left him in Malibu.
But wait, doesn't Diane want to marry Mr.
Peanutbutter? No, see, she thinks she does, but she actually doesn't.
That's why we need to be good friends right now, and put our own feelings aside and sabotage our friend's engagement.
Oh Wait? What? Oh.
I got here as soon as I could.
What's the emergency? We got to figure out a way to stop Diane's wedding.
Okay.
So when you woke me up in the middle of the night and told me to rush over here because of an "emergency," the emergency you were referring to was Diane getting married a year from now? Yeah, you got any ideas? I'm done.
I'm not going to waste another thought on you.
I am at a bar.
It's the weekend.
I'm gonna enjoy myself.
Look, if you don't have any ideas, just say you don't have any ideas.
Yoo-hoo! Buy me a drink.
Uh, okay.
What's your name, stud? Vincent.
Adult man.
Vincent Adultman.
Ya hear that, BoJack? Vincent is an adult, and I'll bet he knows how to treat a lady.
He very clearly isn't and doesn't.
Would you like alcohol? I certainly would, you sophisticated smooth talker.
Mmm! Tell me all about you.
Mm I like business transactions.
Are you seriously trying to make me jealous by flirting with what is very obviously just three kids stacked on top of each other under a trench coat? Vinnie, what does a guy like you do for fun? I don't have time for these shenanigans.
I got a wedding to shanghai.
Good luck with your business transactions.
Thanks.
Ugh! Officer.
The mail truck pulled up right next to me.
I got a bad vibe.
What was I supposed to do? Not chase the mail truck? Mr.
Peanutbutter, I'm a big fan, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time.
Dangerous Come on Dangerous Aah! Mr.
Peanutbutter! Hey, honeysuckle.
Great news.
I got to ride in a police car.
Bad news I lost my driver's license.
Let me guess.
Were you chasing the mailman again? Yeah, why? Did you see him out there too? Nothing stops them.
Not rain, not sleet, not dead of night, not gates! Anyway, I need a little favor.
Can you drive me everywhere I need to go for the next three months? I really can't, sweetheart.
I'm super busy.
Oh, you're working on our wedding registry.
I'm writing my book.
Right.
But don't forget about the registry.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you know I love you.
And you know I am really excited about getting married, but right now I'm working, and I have a lot of thoughts in my head, and I can't really think about our wedding or the future or me being married to you.
Okay.
What's going on? Talk to me like I'm Michelle Pfeiffer in the Coolio video.
Just Well, um with the leg Hmm, all right.
And Coolio.
Nothing's going on.
It's just that this wedding is kind of starting to feel like a lot.
Honey, relax.
Getting married is easy.
I mean, I've already done it twice.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
I just need to focus on the book right now.
So that's still a no on driving me around? Why don't you hire a driver? Eh-eh-eh-deh Is there a light bulb above my head? Because while you were talking, I just got an amazing idea.
I should hire a driver! Oh, this will be a romp.
If I know me, this will be a romp.
I'm not sure how I feel about breaking and entering, BoJack.
Well, that's the beauty part.
The B&E is really the least illegal piece of this 12-point master plan.
Have you got your tool kit? Check.
Burner phone? Check.
Cyanide capsule? Check.
Wait, why do we need Okay, let's get started.
Enter the study.
Plant incriminating Hello? Todd? Uh Hi, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Take the cyanide, Todd.
Take the cyanide! And hup.
Hup.
And hup No.
Are you here to interview to be my driver? Um yes, I am.
Brilliant.
I didn't even post the ad yet.
Here's me thinking destiny over here.
And hup.
Yeah! Hu-aah! Thank you for your interest in the role of driver.
I know you don't have your resume with you, so I've taken the liberty of letting you use mine.
Yeah, thanks.
Here, business boss.
Let's just have a look here.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, ho, with a resume like this, you should be the one hiring a driver.
Just kidding.
I know it's my resume.
But I see you went to Northwestern.
You know, I'm an N.
U.
man myself.
Go, fighting Westerns.
And it says here you do a great Rodney Dangerfield impression.
Give us a taste.
Uh, okay.
"I'm Roger Dangerfield.
" No respect, indeed.
Todd, you got the job.
Oh.
Can you believe this weather we're having? No, I cannot believe this weather we're having! Oh, wow.
We make a great pair.
It's like I'm Miss Daisy, and you're Minnie Driver.
Hey, I'm bored.
And I think Todd swallowed a cyanide pill and might be dead.
Wanna come over and bang it out? Appealing as that sounds, I have lunch plans with Vincent.
I know that might be hard for you to hear.
Wait, that guy from the bar who is actually three boys stacked on top of each other under a trench coat? Well, don't fly into a jealous rage about it.
Not jealous.
Just reminding you that you are trying to have a relationship with someone who is and again, it's bizarre I should have to point this out three young boys stacked on top of each other under a trench coat.
He listens to me.
Okay, okay, but can you just acknowledge that That you are being jealous? Oh, oh! Already acknowledged.
Toodles.
Look who's not dead.
Better than not dead.
You are looking at Mr.
Peanutbutter's new driver.
You're his driver? That's perfect.
Now you can infiltrate Mr.
Peanutbutter's inner circle.
I don't know, BoJack.
Sure, you'll act all friendly, gain his trust, chauffer him around on his little errands to the groomer and whatnot, but all the while, you'll be studying him, scouring out his weaknesses, biding your time till we're ready to strike.
And once you zero in on his Achilles' heel, we will take him down.
Hooray.
Betrayal.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Keep it cool, Todd.
Hey, pal.
If you're making small talk up there, how about sending a little my way? Um can you believe this weather we're having? No, I cannot believe this weather we're having! Hey, weren't you supposed to be here like a half hour ago? Yeah, I've just been sitting in my car.
Listen, I was looking over my notes, and I think I have enough to go write the book, so I'm just going to do that.
You don't want to interview me anymore? But don't you want to know what my Rosebud is? You told me repeatedly it was the nudie magazine your uncle showed you with the three-nippled woman.
Who was she? I got it all.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'll see you around though, right? Yeah.
I, um Why did you have to make things weird, BoJack? I made things weird? So if you see anything you know we need, like this biscuit warmer, you just run the laser over the barcode, and kablamsky! It goes in the registry.
And that way, everybody knows what I want.
And I know what I want.
Uh Which is what everyone wants.
And it's really clear, and nobody's confused about anything.
Am I crazy, or are you not into this? No, I am.
It's just The big wedding in Nantucket, all these presents I'm so overwhelmed, I can barely consider whether I want or need a biscuit warmer, which I think is how people end up with biscuit warmers.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Okay, picture our lives together.
It's a cold Sunday morning a bunch of years from now.
Maybe robots have taken over, maybe they haven't.
I don't know.
It's the future.
This story isn't about that.
The important thing is it's Sunday morning.
I brought you the paper, fetched your slippers.
You come into the kitchen Can you smell biscuits? Yes.
So can I.
Are they warm? Yeah.
Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for.
Look, if marriage stresses you out, we don't have to get married.
It's not the marriage.
It's the wedding and the year of build-up.
So forget all that.
I've done the whole big wedding thing.
I don't need to do it again.
Let's do something small and casual right here in town next month.
Honestly, that would be amazing.
But we'd have to cancel the doves, and we wouldn't be able to send out those fancy invitations you liked.
Those doves were being jerks anyway.
And invitations They're just a scam made up by the Post Office to keep tabs on us.
Post Office.
Settle down, boy.
And then we talked about his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.
And Oh, oh.
And then that led to a whole conversations about sticks.
Oh, and let me tell you, Mr.
Peanutbutter has got some serious opinions about sticks.
Why are you telling me this? What? You said you wanted every detail.
Did I mention he got a new bandana? Give me something I can use to make them call off their wedding.
Oh, yeah.
Did I not tell you? They called off their wedding.
What? Thank God! Oh, the universe makes sense.
They decided against a big destination wedding, so they're doing it here sometime next month.
What? I guess saying they called it off is probably not right.
Hey, what's this? Oh, yes, I got jury duty, but I can't worry about that right now.
That is a problem for Friday BoJack.
Now think, Todd.
Gotta have something I can use sloshing around in that pot-infused Jell-O shot you call a brain.
Let's see.
Mr.
Peanutbutter likes having his tummy scratched, and Diane's family is from Vietnam, which is where Vietnamese food comes from, and since that goes in your tummy Okay, stop thinking.
Just give me raw data.
What's happening this week? Well, the circus is in town.
Congress is going to vote on the new Education Bill With Mr.
Peanutbutter! What's happening with Mr.
Peanutbutter? Well, I'm taking Diane and him to the bank on Thursday.
I can use that.
I can actually use that.
I don't know if I'm up for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.
Oh, come on, character actress Margo Martindale.
They say that there are no good parts for women over 50.
I want to stick an AK-47 in your hand and prove them wrong.
I do tire of the limitations of stage, film, and television.
You might as well perform in a cage, am I right? This is guerilla theater No stage, no script, no net.
It's the kind of work we talked about doing that night in the desert.
Don't tell me we left those dreams in the sweat lodge.
Hell, I'll do it.
And that little boy never found his mother.
Hey, guys.
BoJack Horseman? Oh.
Hi.
What a weird coincidence.
I did not know you would be here today.
How are things? Things are good.
You? Things good with you? Hands behind your head, everybody.
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.
What an unfortunate surprise.
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring? This one.
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring? I'll take it.
But it's my engagement ring.
Give it to her, Diane.
It's just a ring.
Just a ring? That ring is a symbol of your love.
If you don't care about the ring, it really makes me wonder if you care about the woman wearing it.
That terrifying bank robber is making some very cogent points.
No, Mr.
Peanutbutter's right.
If the ring is just a symbol for love, why would I need a symbol when I have the real thing right here? Yeah, we don't need rings, we have each other.
Hey, why are we even waiting a month to get married? If anything, this bank robbery is reminding me that life is short.
We should get married even sooner! No What do you mean sooner? Why not this weekend? We could get married Saturday.
Am I crazy? Yes.
Don't do it.
Oh, keep the damn thing.
Aw.
Okay.
Saturday it is.
What the hell just happened? Something truly beauti Aah! Oh.
Get your hands off me! Uh-oh.
Long story short, Erica did have to lose the foot, but she gained a friend.
Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there.
Diane and I wanna thank you all for coming to our impromptu rehearsal dinner, even though we did not actually have time to organize a rehearsal.
Or a dinner.
But there is an open bar which you are all welcome to partake in as soon as I finish this toast, which I will be doing right after one more quick anecdote.
It was winter in Prague, and the consumption hung low in the air.
Well, the bank thing was a dud.
Thanks a lot, Todd.
Well, you win some, you lose some.
It's like Vincent always says "Oopsy.
" Vincent? Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.
We've hung out a couple times.
What are you ta That dude is funny.
You know he's not a person, right? Look, I don't want to get in the middle of your whole thing with Princess Carolyn.
It's not about that.
I just don't understand why nobody else seems to notice that she is dating a man who is clearly three little boys doing the thing from The Little Rascals.
Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.
If I could say a few words? BoJack Horseman.
Take the mic.
Spin us a yarn.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, Diane.
Since I am friends with both of you and have no ulterior motives Mm-hmm.
I would like to offer my restaurant as a venue for your wedding.
Wow! Really? I don't know.
That's too generous.
Hey, don't look a horse's gift in the mouth, right? I get it.
Like the song.
That's not a song.
All right, everyone.
That's it for the toasts.
Enjoy yourselves and each other.
This is perfect.
Now that the wedding's at my restaurant, we have the home field advantage.
Perfect for sabotage.
BoJack, I need to thank you.
You calling me to the bar the other night turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me.
I think I'm in love.
Okay.
This "person" you're in love with Have you seen him without his trench coat on? I don't understand why you can't be happy for me.
He's a good boyfriend.
I actually think you and Vincent would really hit it off if you gave him a chance.
You should spend some one-on-one time with him.
You mean one-on-three time? Because there are three of him.
We get it.
You don't like him.
I'm actually not sure you do get it.
I know what's been going on.
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.
I was just taking my penis out.
You've been driving me around, but there was something else happening the whole time.
I see it now.
What are you talking about? You weren't just working as my driver, Todd.
You were becoming my friend.
Oh, yeah.
That was happening.
Well, I could use a friend right about now.
There's something I really gotta get off my chest, and if it got out, it could destroy the whole wedding.
No, I'm not great with sensitive information.
I don't know if I'm ready to get married again.
Don't get me wrong.
I love Diane so much.
I didn't have any doubts until I realized she had doubts.
Then I figured she's smarter than I am.
Maybe she knows things I don't.
You are kind of unloading a lot of sensitive information here.
Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane, but I can't even commit to my favorite type of stick.
Yes, today, it's short and knobby, but tomorrow? Well, sure, Diane is short, but I don't know about knobby.
The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane, but I keep having this dream where she's gone.
There's no break-up, no tragedy.
She's just gone, and my life continues without her.
And it terrifies me to say this, but in the dream I feel relief.
Hey, thanks for listening to all this.
You're a really good friend, Todd.
Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel, I had to offer up my restaurant, but now, we're on my turf.
Time for operation "I don't.
" Yeah, sounds good.
You know, with my knack for coming up with plans and your ability to hear them without contributing more than three words at a time, we make a pretty good team, don't we, Todd? You said it.
See? Beloved character actress Margo Martindale is in police custody tonight for her role in a failed bank robbery.
Margo Martindale? But first, pizza for breakfast? The answer might surprise you.
I know her, but how? Wait.
She was at the convenience store the night I bought that video game and ruined my rock opera.
She's the one who asked me to hand her that tape from the 10Â¢ bin.
That means Margo Martindale likes tapes! And a tape is something you listen to, but tape is also a sticky thing you can use to seal boxes.
Boxes is what cereal comes in.
What does it all mean? Am I just grasping at straws? Wait.
Straws That's it.
Straws are used to drink soda or water, and plants need water.
And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant at the bank and the convenience store, which means Ugh! BoJack hired Margo Martindale to make me find that video game so he could kill my rock opera! Aw, dude.
Rise and shine, Todd.
I didn't sleep.
Well, we're down to the wire, but we still got one more day to figure out how to stop this wedding, and I can't afford to waste one second, so let's get Oh, shit.
Forgot about jury duty.
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.
And so, you saw the defendant.
Yes.
That man, the defendant You saw him? Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.
That's correct.
The defendant was seen by you.
Sweet Jesus.
Some of us have weddings to ruin.
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.
I misspoke.
A lot of further questions.
The jury finds the defendant not guilty on all charges.
We did the right thing today, BoJack.
But you know who the real winner is? Justice.
Mr.
Peanutbutter.
BoJack.
There's my superstar.
How are you? Amazing! This has been the role of a lifetime.
I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc, and when I get there, I'm gonna find the meanest, hardest queen bitch of the yard, and I'm going to bite her finger off.
That'll show everyone I'm crazy, and you don't mess with crazy.
Plus, free finger.
Oh, here I am blabbering on about my plans.
Did you ever stop that wedding? It's actually happening right now.
I ran out of time.
I never understood why it was so important to keep those two apart.
I was just trying to be a good friend in my own shitty, ass-backwards way.
Diane deserves the best.
She's smart and kind and beautiful, and it's gonna be mostly synonyms from here on if I keep going, and I'm in love with her.
Tell her that, BoJack.
You don't need kooky schemes or nutty capers.
Just go to her and speak from your heart.
Then find the biggest person at the wedding and bite his finger off! You're right, partly.
I've gotta tell her how I feel.
Okay, I'm gonna do it.
Good luck with your finger thing.
Todd, thank God you're here! Did I miss it? Is it too late? Dude.
I'm done with this.
No.
No.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's been nice to me.
Mr.
Peanutbutter is nice to everybody.
That's what makes him so stupid.
No, I'm stupid.
But even I know that the only reason you're doing this is because you're in love with Diane.
Yes, that's right.
And I'm here to finally tell her how I feel.
BoJack, she knows how you feel.
How? I barely just realized Hey, man, she made her choice.
Look around.
This day is not about you, okay? So maybe you should just stop trying to mess with other people's lives.
I never thought I wanted to get married.
It's so weird, this idea of dedicating yourself to something for the rest of your life.
Like, how could you know, right? But then I realized it's okay to not know everything.
And some things take a leap of faith.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I want to take that leap with you.
By the power vested in me by one of those dumb websites, I now pronounce you married.
Go ahead.
Kiss, you lovesick dummies.
Ow! Mmm-yeah I used to think maybe Hey, Todd.
Todd.
Thanks for hearing me out the other night.
I'm really glad I went through with this.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Always happy to be of service.
Oh, and, um, I got you something.
Todd Chavez? Hey.
That name's my name.
What's "PB Livin'"? My film production company.
Read your title.
"Executive Vice President of West Coast Operations.
" Whoa! Does that mean I control the waves? No, it means you're my assistant.
You've got a big future ahead of you, and I don't want you to waste any time looking back.
So I got all my cars' mirrors taken off.
Isn't that kind of dangerous? What do I care? I'm not driving.
Hey, BoJack.
Thanks for coming.
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.
You're a good friend.
I'm really glad to know you.
Mwah.
Sorry that I If I made things weird.
They weren't that weird.
Oh.
Diane, honey? Oh, I gotta go dance with my husband.
I'm married! Hi.
So you're the quote-unquote person, singular, that everyone's so crazy about.
What have you got figured out that I don't? Um, adult stuff.
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.
But that doesn't matter.
Not everything's about me.
And maybe I am a little jealous.
Not because I actually want to date Princess Carolyn anymore, but just because I don't like the idea that I can't.
I guess I just assumed I always could.
But I made a lot of bad decisions.
Not just with her.
With with everyone, really.
You know, Princess Carolyn was right.
You are a good listener.
Thanks.
You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone.
And I'll never get it back in me.
It's too late.
Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it? Don't be sad.
Good horsey.
That actually feels kind of nice.
We're very different, but I think that we bring out the best in each other.
It's like you're chocolate and I'm Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Shut up and kiss me, you silly goof.
Cut! Welcome back to Excess Hollywoo.
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type, and I'm visiting the set of Mr.
Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.
I'm thrilled to be talking to the star of the film, BoJack Horseman, and his real life inspiration, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Am I an inspiration? Well, that depends on how you define Wait a minute.
Yes, I am.
Ugh.
You know, I'm just over the moon to be producing this movie about my daring exploit.
Yes, your daring exploit.
Yes.
It's such a treat to be shooting in my very own casa.
And it's an even sweeter treat to be played by my good amigo dare I say best amigo? You "daren't.
" We're so in tune.
We even finish each other's sentences.
Sometimes it doesn't happen.
It never Happens.
Ah, see? I'm inside him.
BoJack, you haven't worked in quite some time.
In fact, I thought you were dead.
You must be so grateful to be working again and also alive, which, again, I thought you were not.
How did you get involved with this? Well You want me to play Mr.
Peanutbutter in the story he stole from me? I stole the D, and then he stole my stealing of it.
That makes him an idea thief, which is much less cool than a thief thief, which is what I am and what he also is.
You know what might help? If you think about this like a professional instead of a big titty baby.
This movie is a huge opportunity.
Quentin Tarantulino is known for revitalizing dead careers.
This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs did for Rin Tin Tin.
But isn't there any other part? I could play myself.
No, BoJack's already being played by Wallace Shawn.
What? The short guy from The Princess Bride who says "inconceivable"? Why Wallace Shawn? BoJack Horseman? I don't want to play that boob.
I'm trying to help you out, Wally.
You're the one who keeps buying expensive Rothkos.
I have a disease.
Would you tell an alcoholic to stop buying alcohol? You know, Black and Blue Number 7's going up for auction next week.
Fine.
I'll do the dumb movie.
Fine.
I'll do the dumb movie.
But if you find me in a bathtub with open wrists tomorrow and the words "I hate my agent" smeared across the walls in blood, you'll know why.
So obviously I'm thrilled to be here, just thrilled.
Cast and crew only.
I know you're just doing your job, but I live here, and the crew has been here since 3:00 a.
m.
, so I'm a little tired.
Cast and crew only.
Hey, stranger.
Haven't really seen you since the wedding.
Kind of feels like we're coming back to school after summer vacation.
Yeah.
I'll see you at the pep rally.
Hope we don't get Mrs.
Kirkman for trig this year.
Yeah, well, I hope the cheerleaders don't stuff me in a locker and write "virgin slut" on my forehead, and then when I ask how I could be both a virgin and a slut, they make me eat a lipstick.
Uh So what have you been up to these last couple months? Well, I've been pretty busy.
Met a girl at Soho House.
Was she your waitress? Yes.
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.
Was she also your waitress? Yes.
Then I met a girl at P.
F.
Chang's.
Let me guess.
She was your A hooker, yes, but what she really wants to do is wait tables.
Well, I, for one, would love to meet the aspiring food-service worker who finally gets you to settle down.
What? Why would I want to settle down? I'm 50.
Yeah, anyway So I'm sending the first draft of the book to Pinky this afternoon.
What? It's done? Not yet.
Almost.
I'm excited for you to read it, but I'm also cripplingly nervous.
I actually kind of feel like throwing up, but I can't throw up because I haven't had anything to eat because this lady won't let me in my own kitchen.
Cast and crew only.
Listen, if reading a book you wrote is anywhere near as great as it is to actually spend time with you, I'm sure it's gonna be wonderful.
Having said that, what do I know about books? I'm just a dumb actor.
I'm here with Hollywoo darling Naomi Watts.
Tell me, what attracted you to the role of Diane? I just keep getting pigeonholed as these complex characters in highly acclaimed movies.
For once, I would just love to phone it in and play a two-dimensional girl in a rom com with no inner life of her own.
That's kind of the reason I got into this business.
Ha ha! You said words.
Now, is it true you stay in character between takes? Oh, we all do.
The director insists upon it.
He even has everyone calling me Diane to help me get in the headspace.
It's been great.
Diane, looking good.
Um, thanks.
Ugh, not you.
I was talking to Diane.
Oh, thank you.
Now, where's my peanut butter? Right over here, Q.
No, I'm looking for peanut butter.
Oh, you mean BoJack? If I wanted BoJack, I would call BoJack.
Did someone call for BoJack? It really cuts down on confusion.
Ah, show business, the great equalizer.
Is that what it is? Todd, spritz me.
Spritzing.
Mm, mm, mm.
Well spritzed.
Have you ever been on a movie set before? No, sir, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Please, Mr.
Peanutbutter was my father's name.
Uh And it's also my name! Ooh, speaking of Mr.
Peanutbutter, I'll be back in a jiff, skippy.
Keep that air spritzed for me.
Aloha, kemosabe.
Hey, allow me to put on my producer hat and produce you just for one second here.
I have a few notes on how you're playing me.
Let's see.
Problems, problems, problems, ah, here we go.
I find it really troubling that my movie self is wearing a crew neck T-shirt.
I only wear V-necks.
You see the problem.
I do not.
I just think if we're telling the story, we should tell it how it really happened.
Yeah, this whole story isn't how it really happened.
Right because of the shirts.
Because I'm the one who stole the D.
I'm the real hero here.
My life is full of exciting adventures.
I should write a book.
Oh, wait.
I did.
Suck on that, society.
Hey, you're in a mood.
Perhaps the tightness of that crew neck is cutting off circulation to the brain? Let me talk to Donna in wardrobe.
We're gonna fix this, buddy.
Donna! What are you doing? I'm just trying to get inside my character, which is you.
Is this how we move our arms? We're so weird.
Is this really necessary? Is this really necessary? That's not what I sound like.
That's not mut mi sound mike.
Hey, what's it been like since we got married? Is it everything we dreamed of since we were little? When I was little, I dreamed of getting a MacArthur grant for my 'zine about how all the girls at school were bitches.
Oh.
Look, the wedding was great.
But that's not real life.
I mean, I guess I got a happy ending, but every happy ending has the day after the happy ending, right? And the day after that.
So the wedding was so much fun.
It was the happiest day of my life.
But, you know, what does that say about all the days I have left? Whoa.
We're such a Zoe.
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.
Hold this.
Todd, my jacket is on the floor.
You're supposed to hold the jacket so it doesn't go on the floor.
Hey, sorry, BoJack I mean, uh, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
But I work for Mr.
Peanutbutter now.
I mean, uh, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Ugh.
I can't believe I'm on a movie set, you know? I mean, this is my first chance to work on something big since my rock opera fell apart.
Man, I really messed up that huge career opportunity all on my own, didn't I? Uh Nothing sabotaged me one bit.
Yep.
You said it.
Well, see you later.
Where can I grab a nosh? Oh, craft services is in the kitchen.
Up the driveway, through the living room, make a left.
Can't miss it.
I'm gonna grab a quick bite.
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.
Okay, fellas, here's the thing about the story.
I don't buy it.
It's like something's missing, but I can't put any of my fingers on it.
Um, maybe once we add the music The music? Are you kidding me? Music? You're fired.
What dumb shit brought this dumb shit? Okay, you're fired too.
Oh, okay.
Anyone else got any bright ideas? Oh, oh, oh, oh! Hey, maybe it make it more Diane-y? Um, excuse me? I don't know.
This is probably stupid, but the whole story's about how this guy's in love with this lady, right? But we don't even know who she is or what she wants.
I mean, maybe give her more lines or words or, I don't know, feelings or whatever? What? He's new.
He doesn't know the rules.
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.
Yes.
Yeah.
I love you.
Who is this kid? You're a genius.
I'm gonna kiss your face.
What? Oh! Come back to my web.
Let's talk about Diane's feelings and make this baby sing.
Hey, Todd, talk to him about the wardrobe, specifically the top half of the wardrobe, specifically the shirt part of the top half of the wardrobe, specifically the neck part of the shirt part of the wardrobe.
Ugh.
What now? I'm sick of this dog and pony show.
The movie is dumb.
Mr.
Peanutbutter is annoying the shit out of me, and there's too much honeydew in the fruit bowl.
Blech.
Honeydew is garbage fruit.
Also, why is BoJack being played by an old, nebbishy five-foot-tall bald guy? Is that how the world sees me? Oh, I see.
So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street, but I'm not a deft-enough talent to capture the essence of the elusive BoJack Horseman.
So sorry to offend you, sir.
I'm just glad my book's coming out soon so people will get an opportunity to see the real BoJack Horseman.
Oh, are you coming out with a book? You never mentioned it.
Plus, Todd's being super weird.
I think he's onto me.
Onto you in regards to what? Oh, right, I didn't tell you.
I sabotaged his rock opera by getting him readdicted to a video game because I didn't want him to move out.
Jesus Christ, BoJack.
Anyway, I think he knows and might be plotting to sabotage me back.
Why is it that 90% of our conversations these days revolve around plotting sabotages? Are you saying I should plot a countersabotage? No, no more plotting.
Just be a good soldier and do your job.
Nobody is out to get you.
Have you seen the new draft? They took it all off you and put it on me.
What? Apparently some dickweed named Todd decided I should be three-dimensional and you should have no lines.
Ugh.
Isn't this town sick of creating three-dimensional roles for women? This happens to me all the time! A.
O.
Scott is sick of talking about how brilliant I am.
Todd.
I guess what I've been saying for the last seven uninterrupted minutes is, how can I forgive my father if I can't forgive myself? True dat.
But none of that matters, because we bring out the best in each other.
I'm the chocolate, and you're Mr.
Peanutbutter! True dat.
Mwah! Cut! Amazing.
This is the movie that I wanted to make.
This is gonna be great.
Oh, my God, I'm so Ugh, what kind of idiot puts food on top of a hill? Hey, so I guess now that the movie's all about Diane, I really need to dig deep and get to know the real you.
So let's talk and talk and talk until I am you and you are nothing but a hollowed-out husk of your former self and every thought and every feeling you ever had belongs to me and me alone.
So do we like Sprite, or are we more of a 7-Up girl? Uh, that all sounds great.
But, you know, the person you should really be talking to is that guy.
Yeah, okay, I'm done.
Diane loves talking to him.
They have great rapport.
In fact, Diane could spend all day talking to him and never talk to me again.
Oh, I get it, because Diane doesn't talk to Diane.
Diane talks to Anybody else.
Hey, Todd, remember that time when you wouldn't clean up your shit? That was hilarious.
We've had some good times.
Oh.
Hi.
So I was thinking, I have some pretty sloppy seconds left over from P.
F.
Chang's in the fridge, and I don't think that I want it anymore.
Maybe tonight you could eat it.
Friendly gesture because we're friends.
Uh Oh-oh, there's my guy.
I heard you had a few more thoughts about the script.
I do.
I was just thinking, what if we made the BoJack character into a real shithead? Is that really necessary? I don't think it's necessary.
Yeah, let's Let's make him be a real selfish asshole so the audience has someone to root against.
You're probably right.
Let's take another swing at the script and give BoJack more to do.
Now, when you say, "Give BoJack more to do" Not now, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
And also, now that I'm thinking about it, why does the movie have to take place on Earth? You are blowing my head.
I hope you like Oscars.
Honeydew? More like, "Honey, do I enjoy eating it? Yes, I do.
" Right? Not right, and I would love to go through all the reasons why, but I've got bigger concerns right now.
Honeydew, go on.
Did you notice that the Mr.
Peanutbutter part has been cut in half? What is happening to our movie? I thought you hated the movie.
Yeah, I do, but if I'm gonna be in a dumb movie I hate that makes no sense, I should at least be the star of it.
Look, I agree that this movie has really lost its way.
I mean, first of all, why would Mr.
Peanutbutter wear a crew neck T-shirt? And second of all, uh It's just the shirt, isn't it? It doesn't make sense.
I'm a V-neck man.
A V you can put your sunglasses in.
Can you do that with a crew neck? Because I'd like to see you tr Whoa.
Bagel.
Thanks so much for running this scene with me.
I have so many lines to learn.
Yeah, well, most of my lines are, "True dat," but I guess it never hurts to practice.
The citizens of Planet D want their king back.
But I'm more concerned with getting my self-esteem back after being in the shadow of powerful men for so long.
True dat.
Is it just me, or is this movie kind of flying off the rails? Well, I don't want to overuse my catchphrase here, but true dat.
This is so typical.
I just wanted to do something light and fun to distract me from the deep well of sadness that is my life.
You probably wouldn't understand.
Oh, puh-lease.
I'm so deep down a well of sadness that Baby Jessica is like, "Damn.
" Shut up and kiss me, you miserable goof.
What? Oh.
Okay.
Mwah.
Pop this in a drawer.
Huh? This is good, baby.
Oh, this is amazing.
Naomi, I haven't felt like this since No, no, shh, shh, shh! Call me Diane.
Okay, got my bagel.
Now back to work.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys! Wow, wow.
So you guys really hit it off, huh? That's awesome.
Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom before we go down to set? You read my mind.
Now, kiss me some sour cream.
Hey, so I finished the book and sent the draft to the publishers.
What? My book is ready? Let me read it.
Can I read it? Call Pinky.
He'll probably send you a copy as soon as he's done with it.
All right! You hang tight, baby.
I got an instant classic to read.
Keep the engine running, though, because if I know me, this book is gonna give me a pretty big erection.
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.
You'll love it.
It's a work in progress.
Hello.
Penguin Publishing.
Unless this is that loan shark, in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles.
May I interest you in our bento lunch box? Pinky, it's me.
Let me read the book.
Give me, give me, give me.
Okay, okay, now, I should warn you, it's not quite what we expected, but it is good.
I'm telling you, this could really sell.
I might actually get to see my kids again.
Great.
Send it over.
I'll read it right now.
All right, I sent it, but just remember To set my expectations sky-high? Way ahead of you.
All right, book, let's see what you got.
BoJack, this is you.
One Trick Pony? "The first time I met BoJack Horseman, he was puking cotton candy off the deck of his lavish house in the Hills, the lights of the city twinkling below us.
The Make-A-Wish kids will not soon forget the time the great BoJack Horseman referred to their parents as 'a bunch of used jizz bags.
' He filled the air with words, terrified of silence, as one often is who is smart enough to recognize his many personal failings but unwilling or unable to take the steps required to fix them.
Got out of the car, stepped out toward the coast, and looked across the water, and for a moment, he said nothing.
" What the shit was that? What the shit is this? It's a phone.
Well, a tiny computer, really.
I mean, amazing what technology can You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir, but instead you wrote a story about how you spent six months with me and saw what a big, dumb loser I am.
Well, I realized that the best way to fully capture you, warts and all This isn't warts and all.
It's just warts.
Where's the all? I come off like a total asshole.
You come off as complex and deeply troubled but ultimately sympathetic.
You might be too close to see that.
There's an entire chapter about me eating apple fritters.
You did go through that fritter phase.
Is this book how you see me? That day we ran errands together, I thought that we had a really good time, but you just wrote about how I cried because the dry cleaner took my head shot down.
You were very emotional.
They didn't even replace me with anyone.
Now it's just a faded spot where my face used to be.
This will actually do wonders for your career.
Trust me.
I mean, you're just a dumb actor who doesn't know anything about books, right? What? Remember? From before? Oh, I don't think you understand what's happening here.
This is not a casual conversation between friends.
This is your boss telling his employee that she did a bad job.
Try again.
What? Start over, but do it right this time.
Nobody is ever gonna see this.
Ugh! Diane? Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed? Um, yes.
'Cause I got something that's gonna get you a shit-ton of hearts or digs or smileys or whatever the hell you measure your journalism with.
Curses! My evil plan has been defeated, but I'll be back.
You haven't heard the last of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.
Oh, no! You shot a laser at me! Oh, no! I'm dying.
Oh, no, I'm dead.
And so now that we've escaped the evil clutches of the emperor, I'm free to assume my natural form, an all-knowing floating orb of light? True dat.
Cut, cut.
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.
Is this even a movie anymore? Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.
Yeah, maybe it's an immersive smartphone app or a 21st-century approach to Yeah, or maybe it's just, like, a feeling, you know? We've got work to do.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God, this is so good.
Oh, this is gonna be awesome.
Yes! Go, Todd.
Hello? Are you just gonna leave me like this? Anyone? Ah! Oh, good.
You're here.
Oh, hi, BoJack.
This whole day's been a shit show.
The book turned out to be a total hatchet job.
The movie's a disaster.
But thank God I have one good thing in my life, and that's you.
BoJack, I Please let me say this before I lose my nerve.
I spent 50 years roaming the countryside as a wild stallion, but I am tired of the rodeo, and I'm finally ready to saddle up.
BoJack I guess what I'm trying to say is, this mustang wants to rest his head in the comforts of your spacious barn.
Uh, what? I'm in love with you, Naomi.
BoJack, they fired me and replaced me with a ball on a stick.
I'm so sorry.
But look at the bright side.
Now you and I can just hang out and talk about feelings.
No, but you're not getting it.
Boys never get it.
BoJack, I was in character as Diane, and as Diane, we had a real connection.
But now that I'm off the movie, I'm Naomi again, and Naomi is not interested in BoJack Horseman.
In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.
So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts? No.
You fell in love with Diane.
Naomi what? Good-bye, BoJack.
Ugh.
See? Nothing.
What's going on? Why are they packing up? Oh, glad you're here.
This is exciting.
Since we last talked, this film has gone through so many permutations.
So many.
First, we reimagined the whole film as an interactive social-media experience.
Those are the dumbest words I've ever heard.
I know.
So we realized it was actually more of a floating art installation, but that didn't feel right either.
We thought, is it a high-end perfume? A series of interrelated fortune cookies? A hat that if you turn it upside down, it's a boat? No, it's none of those things.
Exactly.
That's why we finally settled on this.
VoilÃ ! What am I looking at? It is a bimonthly curated box of snacks.
I don't know what that means.
I know.
It's confusing.
Not the bimonthly that means twice a month, the bimonthly that means every other month, and each time it's a different box of snacks.
This is the future of cinema.
You guys, finally, my story has been told.
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.
Thanks for making this box of snacks a reality.
Let's go home.
What the hell happened to the movie? Shit, there were snacks here the whole time? Not bad.
Whoa! Look, I get it.
You destroyed my big chance at a comeback as revenge for what I did to your rock opera.
Revenge? Oh, that would have been such a good idea.
Damn it, Todd! Look, I figured out what you did, but I've been trying to put it behind me and do my job.
So cutting my part down was not about revenge? No.
And making BoJack the villain of your movie was not a coded statement of your feelings about me? No.
Oh, okay, great.
Well, I'm I'm glad we buried the hatchet and everything's cool.
Uh, actually, you know, everything is not cool.
You ruined my rock opera by using character actress Margo Martindale to trick me into playing an addictive video game.
And saying it all together like that, it all sounds kind of ludicrous.
But still, it was something I cared about, and what you did really hurt me.
Oh.
Well, this feels shitty.
You sure you don't want to just get some revenge real quick thump me once in the stones and then we'll be even? I got to go.
I've got some artisanal popcorns to gauge the mouthfeel of.
Hey, BoJack.
Yeah? You want an apple fritter? Uh, sure.
Yeah, I bet you would.
I bet you'd like an apple fritter.
Yeah, an apple fritter would be great.
Why? What What What's happening here? "Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book"? No.
No! Um, everyone, please turn off your Internet.
It has gone bad.
I repeat, the Internet has gone foul.
What a loser.
I'm glad I'm not that guy.
Give me your phones.
I'm a celebrity.
You have to listen to me.
Look at his deep well of sadness.
It's hilarious.
Don't look at me.
I'm well-adjusted.
You all want my life.
Uh, what the hell? I know, I know.
But if you just listen for You posted your dumb little book on the Internet.
No, I just leaked the first couple chapters, and people are already talking about it.
This is wildly unprofessional.
Who do you think you are? I know you're mad, and you have every right to be, but you got to read some of these comments.
People love you.
And they're gonna love you even more when they read the rest of my book.
Your book? Our book.
Nobody is gonna read that book.
How do you still not get that? It is never going to be published.
BoJack, I stand by my work.
This is a really good book.
And if you just give it time, you'll see.
Maybe you're right.
Really? No.
You're fired.
Whoa! Okay, how about this one? BoJack swallowed a dozen pastries in the time it took the caterer to unwrap a fruit tray.
When she asked where the pastries had gone, BoJack claimed he had no idea, spraying her with bits of buttery crust? I did that once.
But with holiday cookies.
I had sprinkles all over my sweater.
See? People respond to the flawed portrait I painted of you.
They see themselves in it.
Why do you love Secretariat? Because he was awesome? No, because he was flawed.
BoJack, when people find out that someone like you, who seems larger than life, is actually just as wounded and vulnerable as they are, it makes them feel less lonely.
No! Maybe that's what flawed, sad fatties want from other celebrities, but for BoJack Horseman, they want a heroic horse-stud who is awesome and who can save them from their flawed, sad, fatty lives.
You're so wrong.
Actually, you know what? Now that I think about it, I think that you're so wrong! Listen, we all agree Diane broke contract by leaking the first two chapters, but the response has been amazing! People want to read more, and we have to get this to the printers by the end of the week, because that's when the repo men are coming to take away our printers.
The end of the week? No! Okay, what if I told you that I could have a new book for you by then? What? Yeah, a better one.
Better stories, better told, by me straight from the horse's mouth.
You're gonna write a whole book in five days? When's the last time you even read a book? The Firm, by John Grisham? Do you think what you do is so hard? "I'm a writer.
I go to coffee shops with my laptop and my notebook and my dumb glasses that I have to wear, because I'm so important I need to see clearly.
" Well, I wish you the best of luck.
You know what your problem is? You think you're so much smarter than everybody.
Well, guess what.
I spent as much time with you as you did with me.
Why don't I write a book about how you married Mr.
Peanutbutter because he's too dumb to see how much better you think you are? Okay, I know you're upset I'm not upset.
I'm just sick of nerd-girls like you beating up on stars like me.
It's pathetic! I'm sorry no one wanted to date you in high school, Diane, but I don't see why I have to suffer just because you were never especially pretty or interesting.
You really let me down, BoJack.
You really let me down.
I apologize for her outbursts.
So, you really think you could write a better book by Friday? Damn right I can, so you can throw this turd of a book in the garbage and then light the garbage on fire.
In fact, you can burn all books, because my book, written by me, is gonna kick your dick off.
Okay, chapter one.
Not quite right.
What? Why are you rewriting the book, bozo? Diane's version is great.
You're gonna lose gems like this one Ahem.
"The only longstanding relationship in BoJack's life is with his agent, Princess Carolyn.
Her loyalty must come from a deep-rooted faith that she's talented enough to sustain the career of a man society perceives as a joke.
" Yeah, I would say that I'm not such a fan of that one.
Look, all publicity is good publicity.
That guy who killed all those teachers and ate their fingers? He just got married in jail, and when this book comes out, you could be that guy.
Don't you get it? This is my last chance to make people love me again.
If this goes out, everybody's gonna see the real me.
Now, I spend a lot of time with the real me, and believe me, nobody's gonna love that guy.
Okay.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go take a shower so I can't tell if I'm crying or not.
All right, let's get to work.
for the truly modern man.
Ha.
No.
There you are, Verdana.
Thought you could hide at the end of the alphabet, did ya? Comic Sans, you drunk, go home.
Okay, focus BoJack, focus.
Here comes the focus.
Well, this can't be that hard.
BoJack often felt the need to impress me with material items.
You can see from the teeny, tiny brush strokes, that this is very expensive.
The color is, um This one they don't even have a name for, that's how exclusive it is, and this I wondered where this came from.
There were two obvious suspects.
His mother Beatrice, heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cubes fortune and used to certain comforts, and his working-class father, Butterscotch Horseman, who struggled, and often failed, to provide those comforts.
Or, maybe it was something even Puuuhhhh! Puuuhhhh! Hey, Todd, Todd! What? What? Todd! Todd! What? What? Eyeballs here Look at me.
Look at me! I need to work.
I can't afford to be distracted.
Don't distract me.
Fine.
Jesus, Todd! Read louder much? Sorry.
Sure, just drop Toaster Strudel crumbs all over the floor, why don't you? Guess I'll just clean them up myself, like always.
I can't work like this.
Come on, come on, come on, pick it up, you dumb vacuum.
I do not have time for this.
I need to write.
What the Come on! Seriously? You cannot be seriou God, why are you keeping me from writing? My parents loved me so much, it was crazy.
I remember one Sunday afternoon, my mother said, "Your father and I want to spend quality family time together.
All the kids in school envy your intelligence and kickball ability.
Here's an ice cream sundae.
" No, wait.
"An ice cream sandwich.
" No.
"A dreamsicle.
" No.
I don't know.
This is dumb.
Nice writing, Shakespeare.
What did I do? Just need something to help me focus.
Coffee.
No, no.
Cigarettes.
No, tequila! No, I just need the right music to do drugs to.
Sarah Lynn, I know things got kind of out of hand last time when I tried to make you stop doing drugs.
So I just want to thank you for coming over this time to give me drugs.
Well, you can't go wrong with Dr.
Hu's drugs.
They're from another dimension.
These are gonna help me focus and get work done, right? Yes.
These are what I give college students so when they come to, their term papers have written themselves.
That's exactly what he needs.
Also, I should probably do another one.
It's "Hu.
" Dr.
Hu.
That's right, Dr.
Hu.
Dr.
Allen Hu.
No, no, no, but I thought it was "Who," like Doctor Who.
Yes, that's exactly what it's like.
No, not H-U, but, "who," like, "Hello, who is it?" I don't know.
Who is it? I'm sorry, is this a joke? Is he telling a joke that I just don't Hard to tell.
Sometimes I just laugh after he talks so he'll leave me alone.
Seriously? Am I the only one who knows the extremely popular BBC science fiction show about the time traveling doctor who saves civilizations? Yeah.
I know what you're talking about Doctor Who.
Yes? No.
Yes, thank you.
Doctor Who.
Yes? I saw the one where she goes to the Wild West.
The Cheyenne called her Medicine Woman.
What? No, that's Dr.
Quinn.
Who's Dr.
Quinn? I most certainly am not.
Hu's not Dr.
Quinn.
Hu's Dr.
Hu.
I don't know.
Third base! When are these drugs going to kick in? Any minute now, if they haven't already.
I want you to take three of these every hour and take two of these every 1/2 hour.
Whatever you do, don't take more than four of these every 90 minutes, and take the first two of the three before you take the second two of the four.
And don't expose yourself to bright light or get wet.
So Gremlin rules? Exactly! Well, I'm off to perform child heart surgery.
Wish me luck.
All right, team, focus up.
We got a book to write.
Yeah, yeah.
My God, this is so good.
It's good.
So good, so good.
Okay, Todd, how is it going with the heartwarming anecdotes? Great! I'm writing about that time we officially became best friends.
Nice! Can you change best to pretty good? Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with the Horsin' Around years? Almost done with the story where Hulk Hogan guest starred and told us to say no to drugs.
Great.
Keep typing, monkeys.
If only Hulk Hogan could see us now, right? What? Because Sarah Lynn said the thing about Hulk Hogan? That was like four hours ago.
Right.
How we doing now? Sending.
Just about to send.
Nice.
Okay, this is great.
That puts us at 216 pages? Holy shit, that's almost as long as The Firm by John Grisham.
And we just needed to get to 200, right? I'm just gonna keep writing.
I got a lot of synapses firing right now.
It's surprisingly literate and insightful, but still fun.
It's a beach read you can thumb through in a wing chair.
Can't believe Diane thought this was so hard.
"My fingers are cramping from all this typing.
It's like they're having their period.
" Did Diane really say that? No, but my fingers are cramping.
It's like they're having their period, am I right? Are you just laughing so I'll leave you alone? Good one.
We just need a way to end this thing.
What should the ending be? Maybe it was Earth all along.
Not that, but something like that.
Keep thinking.
I got it! Did you guys switch clothes? No.
What I don't know.
I like your idea better, BoJack.
What? Your idea for the ending.
What'd I say? About Maine.
About how you end up in Maine.
I like the part where you swim in the lake in the summers.
Yeah, right, and when I get too old to take care of myself, I go for one last swim.
I know I can't make it back to shore.
I'm too weak, too tired.
So I just let the water take me under.
Eesh! Downer ending.
You got something better? Wait a minute.
Maybe we don't know the ending yet because you haven't lived it.
Yeah, I mean, if you want to, like, finish finish the book, then you'd have to, like, die tonight.
I know! I should murder you.
I'm serious.
Think about it.
If the little girl you raised on television killed you in real life people would eat that shit up.
I love it.
It's perfect.
We'll sell so many books.
Yeah.
Yeah, kill BoJack! I'm gonna kill you! Yes! There it is! Yeah, gonna get you! No, no, no, no Okay, so what did we learn? We learned that if we're going to do drugs we should do them at home where it's safe to do them together, right, Todd? No! Don't worry, guys.
I have this gun to keep us safe from intruders.
And each other.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that just your gun-shaped lighter, or your lighter-shaped gun? Busted! It's just a lighter.
Aah! Shit, I guess it's my gun.
Then what'd I do with my lighter? And what did I give to that baby? Ha, I have a gun, too.
Don't be a Silly Billy.
That's a broom.
Wait, am I holding a gun? Todd, are you holding a gun or a broom? I can't tell anymore! I guess we'll just have to shoot them at each other at the same time to find out! Okay! Todd, sh Can I just say Todd, Todd, I need you I need you to shh.
Listen, listen, Todd.
Okay, just to be totally clear, we're shooting each other to determine whether we're holding guns or brooms, right? Not because you're still mad about the whole me sabotaging you with the rock opera and your live stream and suchety-such? BoJack, shh, shh, okay, Bo? Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
As you know, I was hurt, but then I realized that's just how you are.
You know, and maybe I just need to stop expecting you to be a good person, so that way, I won't get hurt when you're not.
O Okay.
Hey, this isn't fair.
I don't have a gun.
Sarah Lynn is right.
You know, if we all had guns, then no one would need a gun, and we would all be safe.
My God.
I think we just solved the gun crisis in America.
Let them eat guns! Bang, bang, pow, pow, yeah, wow! Let's celebrate by taking more drugs.
Now we just have to solve the drug crisis in America.
Easy! We'll take them all.
Yes! BoJack? Hey, sorry.
You okay? Yeah Listen, I've thought about it, and you're right.
Your memoir should be a representation of you.
It's only fair you're happy with how you're portrayed.
Really? Yeah.
And I want to help write a book we can both be proud of.
My God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wha Ooh! Are you okay? No! Not this again! Gaaaaahhhh! What is happening! I ate too many pancakes! Shit, I'm still tripping.
Kiss me.
Go You abandoned me, and I will never forgive you for that.
I'm Mr.
Peanut I'm Mr.
Peanut I'm Mr.
Peanutbutter.
My God! What? Hoo hoo hah hah hah Whoa.
What the Whoa! Okay, stay calm.
I don't have outlines anymore.
That's okay.
There's no boundary between me and space.
This is a thing that happens.
Shouldn't we help him? No, he loves treading water.
God.
My God.
My God.
My God.
Why is everyone laughing? What's so funny? Cut! Get your head out of your ass, B.
J.
Your line is, "This is all I am and all I'll ever be.
" This is all I am and all I'll ever be.
You can say that again, old man.
Horse, horse, horse! What is it? Will you make me a penis butter and va-jelly sandwich? What? I said, make me a penis butter va-jelly sandwich, bitch.
No, no.
No? Well, isn't it too late to say no, BoJack? This is the road you chose.
I'm sinking, somebody help.
The floor is tar.
Why don't you come with me? Come to Maine.
I can't, I'm stuck.
Do they have Pinkberry in Maine? I can't! Go out there.
I can't.
Can't lives in a house on Won't Street.
You will not embarrass me in front of the entire Supper Club.
I told them you were going to sing the "Lollipop" song.
But I don't feel like singing.
Nobody gives a damn what you feel.
You've got an audience out there, and they want to hear you sing.
Now, you want your mommy to love you? You go out there and you do the only thing you're good for, which is singing the goddamn Lollipop song.
And let me tell you somethin'.
The secret to living forever is No.
Hey.
What seems to be the problem? Good grief.
I'm so depressed.
I just want everyone to love me, but I don't know how to make them do it.
You can't force love, you blockhead.
All you can do is be good to the people in your life, and keep your heart open.
I screwed it all up.
It's too late for me, isn't it? I don't know.
I'm just a crazy drug hallucination.
I'll say whatever you want me to.
Then tell me it's not too late.
Well, it's not too late.
It's never too late.
Yeah, that's right.
It's never too late to be the person you want to be.
You need to choose the life you want.
That'll be 5Â¢ please BoJack.
Yes, dear? Supper's ready.
Ran into Ed at the hardware store.
He said we're in for some weather.
What the hell does that mean? "Some weather.
" We're always in for some weather.
Guess what, Ed? There's never not weather.
BoJack, don't.
Come on, I can't help it.
It's just so cute how they do it automatically.
How do they know? Man, can we just stay exactly like this for the rest of our lives, please? Yeah, okay, sure, or we could do the opposite of that, because I'm pregnant.
What? That's amazing.
Yeah, and I'm 80% sure it's yours.
Is it weird that I want to make love to you right now? Why would that be weird? I don't know, it's I don't want to spook the baby.
Maybe we should just do mouth and hand stuff for the next nine months.
I think someone's awake.
Dada coming? Dada coming? Yes, Gooby Girl, Dada's coming.
Dada.
I'm gonna eat your finger.
Yum, yum, num, num.
Daddy? Harper? Where do the stars go? They're still there.
We just can't see them because the sun is shining.
Daddy? Harper? Do you think if you were a little kid, we would be friends? Well, that depends.
Do you love cookies, and the color green, and braids? Yes, I love all those things.
Well, then, your application has been submitted and is pending board approval.
Approved! Wah! Whoa! No splashing! No.
It's rough, don't.
You're tickling.
I got you! She grew up so fast.
I don't like that he drives a motorcycle.
Honey, a Vespa is not a motorcycle.
Okay, okay.
What are you thinking about? Just how nice things could've been if you had chosen this life.
What? Where? Hello? BoJack, I read the pages you sent me last night, and I have to tell you, your book is absolutely, without a doubt, the most gibberish.
It's gibberish.
What day is it? Let's see what you got here.
You got 20 pages of Doctor Who erotic fan fiction, a recipe for soup, five different theories about how 9/11 happened, and a bunch of embedded YouTube videos that can't possibly be printed in book form.
Okay, I gotta go.
Any questions, at all, for our panel of ghostwriters? Um, yeah, I have a question for Tori Spelling.
Again, Tori Spelling is not here, as I already explained.
Tori Spelling's ghostwriter is here.
This is a ghostwriter convention.
How do you not Okay, next question? Yeah, this is for the whole panel.
What's your favorite kind of ghost to write for? What? No, they don't write for ghosts.
That's not wha Why did I think this would be a good idea? Does anyone have an actual question for someone on this panel? An actual question, or a gun, so I can shoot myself? Yeah, I got a question.
Thank God.
My question is for Diane.
Look, I'm sorry about all the stuff I said about you earlier.
We can publish the book you wrote.
You're obviously a better writer than I am, and I don't actually even really care what the world thinks about me anymore.
I just hated reading that book because I hated feeling like that's how you saw me.
Because I guess you know me better than anybody, and if you think that Um, I guess my question is, do you Do you think it's too late for me? What? I mean, am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The The person in that book? It's not too late for me, is it? It's It's not too late Diane, I need you to tell me that it's not too late.
BoJack, I I I need you to tell me that I'm a good person.
I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive, but underneath all that, deep down, I'm a good person, and I need you to tell me that I'm good, Diane.
Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? Boxer versus raptor.
When we booked you for this show, you'd just won the Triple Crown, but then just this week, I open up the newspaper, and look at this "Secretariat Under Investigation.
" What am I supposed to do with that? Maybe it's a different Secretariat.
Ha ha ha ha.
No, but seriously, folks, there is no truth to these allegations.
I have never bet on horse racing, and I certainly did not bet on my own races.
Although I did bet the network's gonna give your show back to Joey Bishop.
O ho ho kay.
We get letters here on the show, and one particular letter, for you, actually, struck a chord with our producers.
This is from BoJack H.
BoJack is nine years old.
BoJack writes, "Dear Secretariat, I am a horse just like you.
I like to watch racing, and you are my favorite racer.
" Smart kid.
"When I grow up, I want to be just like you, and I think I'm on the right track.
Get it? Track, because horses run on tracks, and you are a horse, and I am a horse.
Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?" Okay, there's a whole page of this.
Should I write him back and tell him I get it? He goes on, "My question for you is, I am a good kid, and I like to play, and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad.
What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad? Sincerely, BoJack.
" That's a great letter.
BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad.
A lot.
I didn't come from such a great home, but one day, I started running, and that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running.
BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead and you keep running forward, no matter what.
There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down, but you don't let them.
Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you.
There's nothing for you behind you.
All that exists is what's ahead.
Good morning, Louisville.
It's August 22nd, 1973.
A sad day for the sport of horse racing.
Secretariat banned for life from competition.
It's a disgrace is what it is.
This is the '70s.
You can't cheat in sports and get away with it.
You know, I think it just goes to show you, you can be the fastest runner in the world, but you can't outrun the truth.
And traffic is jammed today coming into Louisville.
Looks like some idiot parked his car on the bridge.
sync and corrrections by caioalbanezi And the Golden Globe for Best Comedy or Musical goes to BoJack Horseman, my friend, for his book One Trick Pony.
This is a first win for BoJack Horseman and his first appearance at the Globe ceremony since his forced removal in 1992 after he exchanged blows with Sir Paul McCartney.
Wow, what an honor.
I have to thank the Hollywoo Foreign Press.
I feel like I should mention that my book was not a comedy or a musical.
Do you guys actually watch the movies you give awards to? 'Cause I kind of get the sense that Also, my book was not a movie.
You do know that, right? We're friends.
Anyway, the response to this book has been incredible.
These last three months have been really amazing.
You know, a lot of people said to me, "You sure you want to publish this book? It's pretty personal.
" And I said, "If I can make just one person out there feel a little less alone, then it's all worth it.
" And they said, "That's really brave.
" And I said, "Well, I'm not one to call myself brave, but since you said it, yeah, I am.
" After-party at my restaurant! Why did I say after-party at my restaurant? I do not want to throw a party.
It did seem unlike you.
I'm gonna go get some cotton candy.
You want some? No.
Yes.
There he is, man of the hour.
Hello, other grown up.
Cheer up, dummy.
Your book is a huge success.
Everybody loves you.
You just won a Golden Globe.
If you can't be happy tonight, maybe you'll never be happy again.
I'm sorry, is that supposed to be encouraging? Because it's super-bleak.
Vincent Adultman how are things at the old nine to five? Good.
I went to the stock market today.
I did a business.
I keep telling him he works too hard.
Come on, Vincent, let's get away from the rat race.
Take a cruise someplace wet and Latin.
I mean, can you imagine this body in a swimsuit? I literally cannot.
Vincent, let's do a lap.
Have you met Brendan Fraser? I feel like you two would love each other.
Whoa.
Easy, easy.
I got to hand it to Diane.
This book has been everything she said it would be.
Yeah, she knows what she's doing.
How is Diane? I haven't seen her since Well, I haven't seen her in a while.
Well, the book's been huge for her, too.
She's practically as famous as I am now.
We're like the Brangelinas.
Well, I'm happy she's happy.
And how are you? Well, it's been really hard Erica, is that you? Who let you out of the burn ward? Get over here, you.
Excuse me.
I just have to tell you how much I love your book.
It's so naked and honest and revealing.
It is? .
I love the part about how you became famous so you could be constantly surrounded by distraction and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself.
I thought that was a really profound observation.
Yeah, definitely.
So profound.
Do you want to get out of here? What? Come back to my place, maybe get a little more naked, honest and revealing? No.
No, thanks.
What about you? Yeah, okay.
Whoa.
Hey, Diane.
You still friends with BoJack? Heard you two were on the outs.
You gonna write another book about it? You looking at some oranges? You gonna write a book about those oranges? Hello.
Diane.
Sebastian St.
Claire here, famed billionaire philanthropist/adventurer.
Please, hold your applause.
Okay.
You can applaud a little.
Okay.
I got your number from Pinky Penguin.
I'm looking for a journalist to follow me around for a few months and document my daring exploits aiding ravaged communities and displaced people.
Ssss.
Wow, that sounds amazing.
But that's not usually the kind of thing I write about.
Diane, if you can make people care about BoJack Horseman, surely you can make them care about emaciated orphans with missing limbs.
We need to wake people up.
Well, I am a morning person.
I hope you mean mourning with a "u," because, Diane, this is deadly serious.
Yes, of course.
You want to spend three months in Sudan? Not just there.
We're also going to Haiti and Thailand and Uganda and Chechnya.
Can't you do all that in L.
A.
? I want to do something important.
I want to help people and do good work and sleep on the ground and poop in a bucket.
Honey, nobody wants to poop in a bucket.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I want to poop in a bucket.
If you want to poop in a bucket, we can get you a bucket.
You don't have to go all the way the Chechnylavakia.
Am I saying that right? It's not just the pooping in a bucket.
I think it might be good for me to get out of L.
A.
for a little bit.
Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for in these awful made-up places.
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void.
The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning.
It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead.
Well, I guess I can keep my options open.
Great.
Hey, can I ask you something? Did Vincent seem extra weird to you last night? Well, he's still three kids in a trench coat, so, no.
We're going through a rough patch.
It's hard, you know.
He's works a full time job at the business factory, so when he gets home, he just wants to unwind by watching R-rated movies.
I thought I was ready for a real adult relationship, but Enough about me.
BoJack, you are on fire.
Are we talking about me again? We have an offer on the table for you to play the bad guy in the new James Bond.
I agree.
Total garbage.
But this, it's a new drama from the Coen Brothers.
A western about a one-horse town and you're the horse.
Hello, Oscar.
What do you think? I think now's the time to finally make "Secretariat.
" Really? Now? Aren't you a little, um, very too old? You asked me what I wanted to do.
That's what I want.
That's all I've ever wanted, and if I can't get it now, then all of this has been for nothing.
Fish.
Of course! Why would you ever make things easy for me when instead you could make things incredibly difficult? Laura, clear out the rest of my day.
I have to push a boulder up a hill, and then have it roll over me time and time again with no regard for my well-being.
Attagirl.
All right, Todd.
PB Livin' needs a new project.
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks has been an enormous success, but I got into this game to make movies, so let's make a movie.
Well, I got a stack of great scripts here.
Any one of them would make a wonderful movie.
Fantastic.
But I also have this other non-movie-related idea.
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.
Okay.
I was heading down Wilshire, and I saw this empty store front, and I thought, "You know what this world needs?" Edge of my seat over here.
A store where people can buy Halloween stuff.
Halloween store.
Feel like that's been done.
Yeah, in October, but how come your never see a Halloween store in January? It's an untapped market.
Yeah.
A Halloween store that's open year-round.
No, no.
Just January.
Brilliant.
That's the kind of idea that wins Golden Globes.
I actually think the time is right for "Secretariat," so what do you want to play, like, Secretariat's dad or his grandfather, maybe like an elderly witch doctor who puts a curse on him or something? Lenny, look, I know I'm a little long in the tooth, but I think that you more than anyone would know not to count out an old pro.
Don't play the ageism card with me, kid.
I've laid farts that lasted longer than your entire career.
But Secretariat was dead at Just set the project up and give me an audition.
That's all I ask.
All right.
You got yourself a "go" picture, kid.
And by you, I mean me.
And by "go" picture, I mean I'll make some phone calls, we'll see what I can do.
And by kid, I mean middle-aged adult.
Shh.
No, no, no.
Put it here.
Put it here.
Okay, I'll do it.
Ahem.
Has this ever happened to you? Has what ever happened to me? Todd? Yes, Mr.
Peanutbutter? What's going on? Why are you talking like that? Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea for a Halloween costume.
Why don't you and I dash over to the store right quick and spend some hard-earned American money? But, Mr.
Peanutbutter, didn't you hear? It's January, and the Halloween store won't open for another nine months.
But I want satisfaction now.
Has this ever happened to you? Not to anyone ever at any time.
Ahem.
We give you Halloween in January, a truly immersive Halloween experience for the rest of us.
Halloween in January? Please elaborate.
Okay, but before I do, tell the audience.
Have we ever met before? Never.
Well, according to facts, there's more suicides in January than any other month.
I'm getting pretty close over here.
Also, there's less Halloween stores.
Coincidence? Wow, I'm convinced.
This store could save lives.
Unbelievable.
When your powers combine you are somehow even more stupid than the sum of your stupids.
Thank you.
Go on.
You stop encouraging him and you stop encouraging him.
The two of you are playing with fire.
A fire called Having a Good Idea.
Or maybe a fire called Friendship.
Fires aren't called things.
What about the Chicago fire? Or Fire Island.
Or Gabe.
Who's Gabe? Just a fire I met once.
Named him Gabe.
He sounds delightful.
He was.
Good guy.
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about? I don't know.
What's under that coat, Vincent? You need to let me in.
Not right now.
I have to call the guy at the office and take the car to the place.
It's always guys in places with you.
You know, I thought I wanted to date a real adult, but I'm actually young at heart.
I need to feel the grass between my toes.
I want to wear jeans.
I want to dance.
That's baby stuff.
No, Vincent.
There's more to being an adult than just work and business and the tall-person rides at Disneyland.
I want to have fun.
There has to be a difference between monogamy and monotony.
What's mahumanunny? Well, clearly we had a different understanding of what this was.
I'd like to be an adult about this, but frankly, I'm hurt.
I think you should just go, just git.
Get out of my life.
Okay.
Okay.
Could I have another soda? BoJack, you know Kelsey Jannings, our director.
I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity.
Yeah.
Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.
Yeah, he was a lot of people's hero.
Well, you know, here was a guy who had everything Yeah, I know the story.
I'm the director.
Kelsey, be nice.
She's just cranky because she's already seen 30 people read for this today, and we are all so goddamn sick of seeing auditions, so whenever you're ready.
Just jump right in.
Great.
Let's get to it.
Hey, ain't you that horse that won all them races? Not today, ma'am.
Today I'm just a customer who wants a warm slice of pie.
Can I ask you a question? When you're out there on that there racetrack, what are you running from? You want to know the truth? Nothing.
Everyone's running from something, sugar.
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.
People come up to me, they want my autograph, they want my picture.
They think they recognize something in me, and I want to be that person they think I am, but I'm not.
They see a greatness in me, and they mistake it for goodness, but I I know there's nothing there.
As fast as I run, I can't get way from that.
Wow.
BoJack, I think I speak for everyone when I say My God, Andrew Garfield said yes.
We have our Secretariat.
We got Andrew Garfield? My God, it's the best day of my life.
You don't say no to Spider-Man.
This movie is gonna be amazing.
Andrew Garfield! Now, the pills will give you nightmares I mean, just horrifying but the malaria will give you death, so you're going to want to take the pills, Diane.
Hold on.
A mosquito got into my tent.
What do you want? Hello? Diane, it's Princess Carolyn, BoJack's agent.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I'm the pink cat, the one who used to date BoJack.
We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.
Listen, the Turteltaub Company is making a movie about Secretariat.
And since you're such an expert, they want to bring you on board as a character consultant.
What does that mean? It's the cushiest job in the world.
You sit in a fancy chair and eat pastries all day.
And then once a week, you say, "Secretariat wouldn't do that.
" I don't know.
I've already been offered this other thing.
And did you know there are orphans in Sudan You take this job, you can buy all the orphans you want.
No, I don't want to buy them.
Look, if you really want to help people, it doesn't hurt to have a little money in your pocket.
Take the job now, help the orphans later.
There's always later.
Okay, talk it over with your husband.
I got to go get my whiskers trimmed.
I run into walls for days, but I look hot.
How's the pie here? Not good.
Well, I'll take all you got.
Screw it.
Throw it in a bowl with some bourbon and bring me a ladle.
BoJack, we notice you've been pretty down in the dumps lately, but we have something that we think is going to cheer you up.
It's an exciting new business venture that's equal parts new and exciting.
Another one? What happened to your Halloween store? What now? Right.
The Halloween store.
We took the floor out because Mr.
Peanutbutter kept scratching up the hardwood, and then Did we ever get the new floor installed? Halloween? In January? What a great ide Aah! Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.
What? Smoodies.
You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.
No.
Smoodies.
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.
I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood? Like a smoothie.
So it is a smoothie.
No, it's a smoodie A mood that you drink.
How do you drink a mood? Like a smoothie.
But do you buy it in a store? What're the physical attributes? We haven't worked out all the kinks yet, but the important thing is we've gone public, and we want you to get in on the ground floor.
See, that's the problem with all your ideas they don't have ground floors.
Finally, a Halloween store for the rest of Aah! Hello.
Anyway, our launch party's tonight, and we'd love it if you came.
We spared no expense that's how confident we are in our product.
Your product Smoodies.
Yes.
Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies? Because we only make Which one do we make? I'd like to think the smoodies make us.
I can tell by your tone that that was something smart.
Smoodie keychain? Smoodie cozy? Smoodie bottle opener? It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.
Todd, it is all happening.
Hooray.
And you know I don't throw that word around lightly.
All right.
Now we just got to make sure we focus and actually follow through on this.
I'd feel awful if this great idea fell apart because we got distracted by something else, as we are often wont to do.
Wait, did you say you feel awful or falafel? I said, "Feel awful," but tell me more about this falafel idea.
Falafel or fawaffle? What? BoJack, isn't this exciting? Smoodies, right? Do you even know what a smoodie is? I think it's some kind of an adult onesie.
Whatever it is, I'm trying new things.
I'm single again, and I'm loving it.
Let me repeat Princess Carolyn.
Vincent.
Well, you've got some nerve showing your face.
I've got half a mind to No, let me talk.
I had a attitude problem, but then I took a timeout, and I thought about what I did.
I wanted to be a big man.
But sometimes the biggest thing a man can do is tell the truth.
And the truth about me is, I I Okay, here we go.
I love you.
What? Vincent.
Let's go feel grass between our toes.
What? All right.
You're a better man than I could ever be.
I wish my boyfriend was that mature.
Hello? BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.
I got some news about "Secretariat.
" What's up? Garfield's out.
He got into some sort of accident.
An All Hallows' Eve store in January? How fiendishly droll.
Aah! Bother.
The clumsy bastard broke every bone in his body, and now we got to find a new lead.
Studio wants to go young, but I was thinking we'd get someone a little more BoJack Horseman.
What? Are you serious? You're the only one with enough grit to play the part, and we can age you down in post, but I'm gonna tell you now, not gonna put up with any woe-is-me bullshit or diva histrionics.
I get enough of that from my ex-wife along with newspaper clippings about gluten.
God, we get it, Marla.
Gluten.
But if you want to make a movie, and you're ready to work I am.
I will.
I can.
I do.
Great.
You got one month to get in shape.
You need to lose 50 pounds and then gain back 20.
And, BoJack Yeah? Don't ever call this number.
If I want to talk, I'll call you.
Hey.
Hey.
Not big on parties? Nah.
I never know what to do with my hands.
I think I just got cast in Secretariat.
That's amazing.
It's everything I ever wanted.
Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.
What do I do now? Well, that's the problem with life, right? Either you know what you want, and you don't get what you want, or get what you want, and then you don't know what you want.
Well, that's stupid.
Yeah.
I don't know if this makes you more or less excited, but I actually decided to take a job on the Secretariat movie as a character consultant.
Wow, so we're gonna be working together again.
Yeah.
I hope you don't get sick of me.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Is it weird I took this job? Why would it be weird? You literally wrote the book on Secretariat.
Yeah, I know.
I just When I first moved to L.
A I thought I was gonna be doing really important work.
You know, writing stuff that makes a difference.
But then you kind of fall into one thing and then another Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right? Yeah, I guess there's always later.
Do you remember the last time I saw you? You asked me if I thought you were a good person deep down? Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.
Well, do you think I'm a good person deep down? That's the thing.
I don't think I believe in deep down.
I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.
Well, that's depressing.
For what it's worth, I think your writing does make a difference.
Thanks.
I really wanted you to like me, Diane.
I know.
Sorry we didn't get you a birthday present.
I got so distracted by trying to get tickets to the New Kids On The Block concert, I completely lost sight of what's important.
And I got so swept up in my campaign for class president, I forgot why I was running in the first place.
And I was boy crazy.
Kids, kids, I don't need a present.
I got everything I need right here.
Aww.
Macaroni.
Sabrina.
Come here, you goofball.
Aha.
Whoa.
Can you make it out to Blake? Thanks, man.
You're, like, my hero.
Really?
This is from BoJack H.
BoJack is nine years old.
"When I grow up, I want to be like you.
I'm on the right track.
Get it? Track? Because horses run on tracks and you are a horse.
And I am a horse.
Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?" There's a whole page of this.
Should I write him, tell him I get it? He goes on.
"My question for you is: I am a good kid and I like to play, and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad.
What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad?" Oh, big stud, running off to gallivant with your fillies.
Is that to impress me? I can smash a dinner plate, too.
That's a salad plate.
I thought these were salad plates.
Those are saucers.
Why do we even have saucers? We don't drink tea.
Those saucers are for entertaining! Oh, yeah? Well, I'm exit-taining.
Do you get it? But, uh, seriously, folks.
Right? Don't sit so close to the TV, it'll make you cruel.
You know, I was beautiful before I got pregnant.
I know.
You ruined me, BoJack.
I know.
You better grow up to be something great to make up for all the damage you've done.
I will.
and I just kept running.
BoJack Okay, enough me being a great mom.
I'm gonna go hide your father's heart medication.
Enjoy your dumb little TV show.
The first thing is, you gotta believe that change is possible.
You have to tell yourself every day: "I can change and I will change.
" I can change and I will change.
Louder.
I can change and I will change.
Still can't hear you.
You're an audiobook.
"I've got a new attitude.
" That's what your face should be saying to everyone you pass on the street.
We call that the PANTS approach.
P-A-N-T-S.
People all need to see.
People all need to see.
Yeah, a little to the right.
No, house right.
That's an acting term.
It means left.
I'm an actor.
No.
BoJack, why did I wake up in an alley? I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.
While I was sleeping on it? The couch was a metaphor for my old attitude.
My audiobook told me I had to let go of the burdens of my life sofa.
Oh, you know what? Maybe it was "my life so far.
" I feel like you could've woken me up first.
Todd, no one can wake anybody else up.
You need to wake yourself up.
I don't know if I trust this new guy.
I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.
Uh-oh.
I think someone needs a FAB.
A FAB? FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.
BNA? Brand-new attitude.
Try to keep up.
ATTITUDE stands for attention to-Did you also get rid of my stuff? Where's my duffel bag? I value you.
Hashtag "thank you for being a friend.
" Hashtag "PANTS.
" You got to conquer that hill.
The hill is a metaphor.
Everything is a metaphor.
You are literally a metaphor.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is the worst.
This feels awful.
Why does anybody run? On your right.
And she had no idea that her boyfriend was the strangler.
I guess some people just see what they wanna see, right, Vincent? Um Yeah.
Hey, Princess Carolyn.
I gotta go.
One of my dumb-ass clients is here.
Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello.
I jog now.
You jogged here from Laurel Canyon? I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch, so the Fitbit counted the miles.
Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman is here? Thank you, Stuart.
Also, your coffee is coming late.
Just like you ordered.
I said "latte.
" Ah.
Well, I wrote down "late," so that's what it's gonna be.
What happened to Laura? Assistants are like Belushi brothers.
Good ones leave too soon, bad ones never go away.
It's a beautiful day, though, right? Every morning is a miracle.
Hashtag "miracle.
" Hashtag "every morning.
" Hashtag "every morning is a miracle.
" Hashtag "BoJack thoughts.
" I'm glad you found your bliss, but are you ready for your first day on set tomorrow? You mean, am I amped? Because I am so pumped.
This Secretariat movie is a big deal.
Please do not blow it.
Why would I blow it? I have a brand-new attitude.
You know, when I won that Golden Globe last month, I went to a very dark place.
I was in a hole.
And I realized, "I can wallow in this hole or I can change.
" While I was tempted to go with the former, sometimes the only way out of a hole is a latter.
No pun intended.
You clearly intended that pun.
Princess Carolyn, you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE.
Huh.
Uh-uh.
I'm not asking.
The awesome healing power-I am not asking.
--of total positive energy.
You should leave because I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.
Hello? No, he's still here.
No, he's not taking the hint somehow.
Mm-hm.
Honey, where's my bandana? You chewed it up, we had to throw it away, remember? No, not that one.
The one with the bones on it.
With the meat juice stains? The one I wore to the Emmys.
I don't know.
I gotta go.
BoJack's gonna be here any minute.
Did you check the hall closet? I can't see anything in this stupid thing.
I know, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
But you gotta keep it on for one more week.
I look like an idiot.
You look very responsible.
Is the bandana doing anything? Hey, work buddy, first day on the job, huh? Hashtag "great day to start fresh at a new job, sincerely, BoJack.
" @Diane.
Can't believe you wanted to carpool.
Gotta save the planet, Diane.
Hey, is that BoJack Horseman? I don't know because I have no peripheral vision.
Going off of smell here.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, how the hell are you? Loving it, buddy.
Loving life.
Brother, I am right there with you.
I got a brand-new attitude and I am also loving life.
Uh Diane, look at us.
A couple life-lovers over here.
Uh Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.
It is a new cone.
Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone? Didn't notice.
You've got the smile of a winner.
What's going on? I have to wear the cone so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had to get when I punched a mirror last week.
I got drunk and thought my reflection was another dog.
I was so mad at that other dog.
He was wearing my clothes.
We've all been there.
I don't understand what's happening.
Did someone say something to the left? Diane, is that you? Hey, why don't we just us two schedj a hang for this 'kend? "'Kend" is how I say weekend now.
Uh, I love that.
And I got a pair of tix to the 'Stones show this 'kend.
Wanna go? The Rolling Stones? What? Oh, no, no, no.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.
I'm not really familiar with that outfit, but I do love trying new things.
Who are you? Anyway, we gotta get to work.
It was really great talking to you, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
All right, break a leg, good buddy.
Diane, BoJack's ready to go.
Where are you, sweetheart? Are you ready? The house is a metaphor for a home.
Happiness is a metaphor for change.
Happiness is a metaphor-Where are we going? Oh, my God.
BoJack, this is Corduroy Jackson-Jackson, your costar.
Hey, man.
Corduroy Jackson-Jackson.
Oh, right, the underwear guy.
Underwear model/actor/dancer/dreamer.
Also, you know, I'm a huge fan.
I'm so excited/amped/pumped to be working with you.
Yeah.
Hey, man, that's fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.
Hi.
Kelsey Jannings? That depends.
Are you my ex-wife's lawyer? I'm Diane.
I'm here to be a character consultant.
What? I got a call from the studio.
Okay.
Why don't you stand over there and make sure no one trips over that cable? This cable? Do you have a thousand dollars? What? Because each minute I spend talking to you, that's how much money I'm wasting.
Oh.
Sorry.
Hey, who's this guy? Who let this guy in? I just-He's got a funny face.
I like your face.
Thank you.
What a cute funny face.
Cookie? Can someone get this guy a cookie? He's got a soothing face and I like looking at it.
Like a Matisse painting.
Whoa.
Guys, could I get everyone's attention, please? Oh, watch out for the cable.
Don't trip over the cable.
I just want everyone to know what an honor it is to be here.
Secretariat has always been a personal hero of mine.
A complex role that requires a precise touch and a deft hand and I just can't wait to tackle it head-on.
It's truly an honor.
Namaste.
Neat.
So, in this scene, Secretariat's at his lowest.
He just lost his first race, his father was sent to the glue factory.
It's a dark moment.
You got it.
Scene 22 alpha, take one.
Action! Hey, Secretariat.
What are you doing here? Hello? Diane! I can't tell you how disappointed I am you're not here with me in Northern Cordovia.
I'm incredibly disappointed.
Boo! I didn't think I could do it, but I did it.
I'm amazing.
Sebastian, I know you're doing important work.
I couldn't just drop everything and fly to the Third World.
I just got married, and-Diane.
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.
And I need people to witness me witnessing it.
I know, and I'll be there in three months, as soon as I'm done on the movie.
This is also important.
In a way.
Well, lucky for you, there'll still be just as much famine and war and devastation in three months.
I'm not dead yet.
Yep.
Lucky me.
We're still rolling, people.
So, BoJack, in this scene, Secretariat is sad, right? Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, sad.
Of course.
Duh.
Okay, here we go.
Action.
Hey, Secretariat.
What are you doing here? That was bad.
I know that was bad.
Let's keep it rolling.
I'll say when to keep rolling.
Okay.
What are you doing here? Did we get it? I can tell by your face that we didn't.
All right, let me try again.
What are you doing--? I am having trouble with the words.
Is it okay if I play around with it a bit? When did you get here? Sorry, no.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Man, these lights are bright, huh? Can we kill these lights at all? Is that a--? No.
Okay, I'm sad.
I'm sad.
Acting sad.
Secretariat is sad.
Okay, here we go.
I'm sad! Sorry, what was the line? I don't know if this helps or not, but when Secretariat was a kid he actually-Aah! My face! Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa! Oh, my God.
Watch out! Hey.
Whoa, whoa! Oh, my God.
My face.
My beautiful face.
Why didn't someone tell me not to trip over that cable? It was such an important job, but no one was there to do it and now my face is in ruins.
We're gonna need a couple of days to rebuild this set.
So, let's all just use this time to regroup and really figure out what we're doing and why we're here.
So, let me get this straight.
Bad means good? Maybe you should leave the teen-talk to me.
Jeezy Kableezy.
Well, it wasn't Ibsen.
That's your takeaway? That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen? I'm sorry.
Did you need a compliment? Oh, I loved the part where you got your head caught in the banister.
Yeah-And what's this letter I have? It's from the government saying, "I'm proud of you.
" Are you--? No, what I'm holding is nothing.
Can you check on our drinks? I would love some gin.
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open container.
This town is full of AIDS.
That's not-You're a clown, you know that? You've always been a pillar of support.
Gin, please? Is there gin coming? I'm here, aren't I? I suffered through that ordeal.
You know, the man sitting next to me was wearing a T-shirt? A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.
Yes, a T-shirt.
Worst thing that's happened to anyone in a theater.
The T-shirt told me to "just do it.
" Here we go.
I don't know to what "it" the T-shirt referred but I won't be spoken to in that tone by an article of clothing.
Vodka? Triple sec? Looking for any alcohol.
You don't know how lucky you are.
I hope you die before I do so you never know what it's like to lose a mother.
As long as one of us dies, that's good enough.
Can we please get some alcohol into my mouth? The past is past.
That's why it's called the past.
Tomorrow is an opportunity.
You can be big and proud and bang on your tom-tom drum or you can get in your boat and row.
Tom or row.
Tomorrow.
Hey, do you wanna talk? Talk? Why? Why would we do that? So you can put everything in a book and sell a million copies? Wow.
Uh That's what the old me would have said.
The new me doesn't hold a grudge.
No.
I gotta say, the new you seems a little on edge.
What? Me? I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.
That's a metaphor, Diane.
It's a simile.
Goddamn it.
Oh, okay.
Hello? Small talk, small talk, small talk.
Are you blowing it? I heard you're blowing it.
What? Who told you that? Was it Todd? You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.
If you don't-Hey, can you hold on a second? I'm getting another call.
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga, the boy prince of the 26th floor.
Carolyn.
How are things all the way up on 27? Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.
Killing Give me some gossip.
My wife is making me go to the opera tonight.
I need something to distract me from the thought of D-bags singing songs in German about their boners.
Okay, you gotta keep this close to the vest but I am inches from getting Emily VanCamp the lead in Goose Van Sant's new movie about Jackie O.
My clients would f-l-ip if I got them parts like that.
You're killing it in the department of kicking ass in regards to you being an agent and being good at it, crushing it.
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga, for a 26er.
You're the only one in this building who isn't a total snooze-cooze.
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.
I know you're listening.
Ugh.
I gotta go.
I made Natasha cry.
I don't think she's coming back.
Could we keep it down in the front, please? Thank you.
What am I gonna do? Well, you were an actor for nine years on Horsin' Around.
How did you do that? Uh Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? Of course, buddy.
I always have time for you, my good friend BoJack in this, the year 1988.
Have a seat.
Hey, enough with the stomping already! Am I-Am I a clown? Oh, brother.
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom to the taping? As Max Headroom would say, "Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch.
" But I am a good actor, right? BJ, I don't know.
Look-You know what you're good at? Hitting your mark, saying your lines, loudly with good diction.
Should I be doing more? To capture the character and make the audience connect? This is a situation comedy.
No one watches this show to feel feelings.
Life is depressing enough already.
You bring joy to millions of people.
Maybe someday later, you'll need to learn how to act for real.
But for now, don't worry about it.
Oh, shit.
I'm not an actor.
All this time, I assumed there was more to me than everyone thought but maybe there isn't.
That's the part where you're supposed to disagree with me.
Oh, right.
Well, you got the part, didn't you? What did you do in the audition? Well, how should I know? That was the old me.
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Okay.
What should I do? Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico? Start a new life there? Meet a local girl? Fall in love? Talk my way into a job at a textile plant? Work my way up until I own the place? What am I talking about? I can't run a textile plant.
Too much responsibility.
What am I gonna do? The walls are closing in! BoJack, breathe.
You can do this.
You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.
Yeah? Yeah.
Plus, you can watch old Secretariat videos.
I've got a hard drive full of research.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
I can do this.
I've got two whole days.
And when the pressure's on, that's when I shine.
Yeah.
Two days.
I can do all those things.
Oh, shit.
I didn't do any of those things.
What are you doing here? Ah! That was it.
Say that again.
What are you doing here? Okay.
No? BoJack, before we get started I wanted to show you this.
What? This is the machine that's gonna make you a good actor.
Really? No.
We need to make a scan of your face so that if you die, we can finish the movie.
Standard procedure.
When a star is assessed to be of a certain liability, like if there was a whole book written about what a reckless jackass he is, you make a digital replica so you're not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.
Wait, which Belushi? Hold still, please.
Terrific.
We got it.
One day, that's gonna be the job.
Sit for five seconds while a machine scans his face.
Six months later, plugging a movie on Kimmel.
I gotta go on Kimmel now? What if he makes me read a mean tweet? I'm not emotionally prepared.
Don't worry so much.
If you can't do this part we'll just fire you and get someone else who can.
Either way, I'll be fine.
What do you need, BoJack? I don't know.
I thought I wanted this, but now I'm feeling all this pressure.
Think you made a mistake, hiring me? I don't make mistakes, BoJack.
I do the crossword in Sharpie, I never learned the shortcut for undo.
Command-Z.
Don't need it, won't use it.
I'm trying to have this new attitude, be this better, more positive guy.
I keep thinking about how this movie is my last shot at happiness.
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps: I don't care if you are happy or not.
You have a job to do.
This guy again? I'm in love with this kid.
I wanna put you in my pocket.
You're adorable.
Aw.
Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you? Yes.
Yes.
I am a writer.
What do you need? Can you write on a sign "watch out for cable"? You were telling people, but it's a really important job and a sign is less likely to get distracted.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? So, I went a little overboard and I made you two mixes.
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.
The second CD is all of the Bosstones' side projects and solo singles.
Listen to it and imagine the band never took that hiatus in the mid-aughts when America briefly lost interest in ska.
I don't have time.
I don't wanna listen to your music.
I don't wanna hang out.
Get out of here.
All right.
You don't wanna listen to Bosstones together.
That's the impression that I get.
Is it the impression that I get? Yes.
That's the impression that you get.
I see.
Way to go, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
What a stupid move.
Why did you--? BoJack, listen, I know you're scared, but it's gonna be okay.
You gotta be strong.
Yeah, but-You gotta rise to the occasion, okay? So what if the new couch is weird? Or lumpy? Uh, what? What are you gonna do? Just sleep in BoJack's car forever? Are you talking to me, or you--? Damn it, time to stop being a coward.
It's time to go home and sleep on BoJack's couch.
Hurray! Happy ending for Todd! Charley Witherspoon, 28th floor agent.
Charley.
Listen, I wanted to touch base about Emily's start date on Jackie O.
Oh, yeah.
Uh Well, we got some new screen tests and, uh, Goose decided to go in a different direction.
Are you saying the Van Sant camp wants to recant on VanCamp? Because they can't.
Uh Charley, you better get your client to change his mind or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and-Just kidding.
I can't get to the phone right now.
What? This is one of those answering machines that sounds like it's Charley talking but it's actually just an answering machine.
I know you're there, Charley.
Leave a message.
I'm not gonna leave a message.
Beep.
Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again.
Listen-Mailbox is full.
What? Mailbox full? Error.
Message deleted.
Wait-No-Gotta go.
Bye.
Carolyn.
Rutabaga, this is not a good time.
Okay.
Can I please just tell you about the opera, though? How did you like the opera? I loved it.
Loved Tristan, loved Isolde, cried like a bunny.
Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing for the past few days thinking about that Jackie O movie.
I know it's your baby, but I did make a few calls and got my Rooney a screen test.
I put that movie together for my client.
No, no, no, don't freak out.
It's just a screen test.
But, honestly, how fantaj would my Rooney be as a young Jackie Bouv? Stomp once for so fantaj, twice for stupid-fantaj.
Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.
Oh.
Carolyn, I heart you.
You're beautiful.
I wish I met you before I got married.
You can do it.
Only you hold the keys to the house that is you.
The house is at the top of a hill.
The hill is also you.
Five minutes, Mr.
Horseman.
When you get your new attitude, you're gonna wave goodbye to the old-What do you want, Mom? Look who finally decided to pick up the phone.
Do you need more blood? I don't need blood.
I read your book, BoJack.
Oh.
It takes a real narcissist to think anyone wants to buy a book about him.
You know how I feel about Anne Frank.
That was a diary.
I read the parts about me.
The things I said to you.
You must think I'm a real monster.
Mom-I don't wanna fight you, BoJack.
I just wanted to tell you I know.
I know you wanna be happy, but you won't be, and-I'm sorry.
What? It's not just you, you know.
Your father and I, we-Well, you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside you.
You were born broken, that's your birthright.
And now you can fill your life with projects your books and your movies and your little girlfriends but it won't make you whole.
You're BoJack Horseman.
There's no cure for that.
Anyway, do you remember who directed The Philadelphia Story? Five letters, second letter U? Lubitsch? No, BoJack.
Goodbye.
You need to visualize it flying out the window, over the-What are you doing here? Great.
We got it.
Let's move on.
So, at the end of the day, I'm just a regular guy trying to live a regular life.
Remember that time you peed in Drew Barrymore's car? Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that? It was in your book.
-You should do that to someone here.
-What? No.
Well, anyway, I can't believe I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.
I feel like that anonymous girl from Chapter 8 of your book mixed with the pluck and determination of that anonymous girl -from Chapter 12.
-We don't need to dwell on the past.
Wait, shut up.
Is this the restaurant you bought when you were trying to show up Mr.
Peanutbutter? -Uh No.
-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.
Want to yell at the waiter and make a scene? -No, I don't need--Come on, do that BoJack thing where you make a big deal and everyone laughs, but at the same time we relate, because you're saying the things polite society won't.
That's not-Ugh -Is everything all right over here? -No, everything is not all right.
This table's been wobbling all evening.
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick for an hour, I'd call your mother.
-Something in that area or? -Take me home now and don't let me get out of bed until I turn horse-colored.
-What are you doing? -Did you want me to stay? No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.
Some of us here are trying to forget you exist.
"Forget you exist.
" Classic BoJack.
Love it.
Oh, my God, are you Todd? Uh, yes.
"Shut up, Todd!" Aw, okay.
Hey, Todd, can you drive me to get my car? I wanted to be responsible last night, so I Ubered home -and left my car in the fountain.
-Sorry, BoJack.
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening.
My Disneyland.
I realize that by saying "what" I might set off a chain of events whereby we continue this conversation, but what? Well, remember when I first moved in and I kept asking -if we could go to Disneyland? -I do not.
And then you said that there was no Disneyland.
-No.
-That Disneyland was a made-up lie, like the tooth fairy, that parents use to get their kids to behave.
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.
-Sure did.
But then I thought, why isn't there a Disneyland? People would love it! So, I took matters into my own hands, and over the last five years, I built my own Disneyland.
You've been doing this for five years? How have you never mentioned it? I bought that cheap plot of non-arable dirt by the toxic waste dump -up the hill from the old fire station.
-Okay, Todd.
-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.
-Sounds great, champ.
If it wasn't for that, she never would've gotten sober.
Just finished drawing up blueprints for that Disneyland I'm building.
Kind of busy here, Todd.
So, it turned out to be a good thing I peed in her car.
Sorry for all the noise.
Got this crew of worker bees to help me build my Disneyland.
Okay, I get it.
You are building your own Disneyland.
-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.
-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.
Finally, people will have a place to go after they win the Super Bowl.
But you do know that there already is a Disneyland? -Yeah, I built it.
-No, I mean the real Disneyland.
You mean, the one in the hearts and minds of children everywhere? -The one in Anaheim! -I think we're saying the same thing.
Are we? Well, I think it's safe to take the cone off.
I can do it for a small co-pay.
Can't say I'll miss it, but we did have some crazy adventures together these last few weeks.
Honey, would you rub my chin for me so I can remember things? Oh, um, okay.
Uh Yeah, memories.
Hey, where should we go for my first meal after the operation? It's not an operation, but we could go to Storky's again.
Oh, yeah! We're finally due for our free sub.
"Storky's, where your 81st sandwich is free.
" We've been there 80 times? It just opened last month.
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever you suggest it, I always say yes.
Yeah, but 80 times? Well, that'll be $6000.
Good thing you're getting a free sandwich, huh? What the? Huh? Okay, you guys.
You vultures are killing me! I'm sure he's talking about other vultures.
Ah, the Valley.
Because sometimes you wanna go where no one knows your name.
BoJack Horseman! Pinky? Hey, how are you? Oh, great! -How's the book biz? -Who knows? I jumped off that burning ship.
Print media? What a joke.
Now I got a job in broadcast network television, a booming industry with nowhere to go but up.
Oh, God.
-What are you doing here? -Oh, my boss loves this place.
Do you know Wanda Pierce? Wanda just got named head of programming at MBN.
We're here to celebrate.
Well, that and she just woke up from a 30-year coma.
Wait, she just got out of a 30-year coma and she's the head of programming at a major broadcast network? She's been with the company 30 years.
Everyone above her kept getting fired.
Besides, she's got some really fresh ideas.
I am really feeling The Kirk Cameron Show.
I don't even need a pilot.
Let's just order 22 episodes.
How about a new show where celebrities try to guess whether or not people have talent? We'll air it three nights a week.
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar David Copperfield to make the World Trade Center disappear? I hate to be the one to tell you this, but David Copperfield really isn't a big draw anymore.
Actually, everything feels fresh if you just forget the last 30 years ever happened.
Huh.
And here's a special request.
I've never even heard of this song, "Special Feeling.
" Wanda, meet the one and only BoJack Horseman.
-Who? -BoJack.
-Who? -BoJack Horseman.
Is that name supposed to mean something to me? -Do you want to go skate? -Nah.
You know what they say, you can lead a horse to roller, but you can't make him rink.
-What? -That's really funny.
-You're funny.
-Really? Oh, my God.
You should be on TV, which, holy shit, they're flat now.
Actually, I was on.
You know what, I'm sick of talking about me.
Let's talk about you.
Next thing I know, I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch, but it's not ideal.
She's molting.
You know how sisters are.
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here with the regulars.
How hard is it to look before they bring it out? -Excuse me, miss? -I know, isn't it cool? -Like we're getting away with something.
-What? Don't you love it when appetizers have a little crossover episode? It's like when you're watching Happy Days and Mork shows up.
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Or like when Kramer was on Murphy Brown.
-Who? -Hey, you want to get out of here? I don't want MBN to just be another boring old network, you know what I mean? -Yes, totally.
-I want to take risks.
I want to swing for the fences, you know? Otherwise, what are we doing? Oh, my God, is it morning? We stayed up all night talking, -and we didn't even have sex.
-Well, it's not too late.
Oh! -That was fantastic.
-Oh, yes.
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.
-Something's wrong.
-What is it? I don't know, I feel weird, like I want to spend more time with you -even though I know we just had sex.
-Oh, okay.
No, you don't understand.
We already had sex, but I still want to spend time with you.
Is that normal? Am I normal? What is happening to me? We can spend more time together.
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.
-Okay.
-I don't understand these feelings.
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or-Oh, God, it's coming.
I can't stop it.
-Do you want to go to Disneyland? -Okay.
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires and loose nails than I remember.
Please hold your questions until the end of the tour.
Here we have Mr.
Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.
The name is a work in progress, but we wanted to work "death" into the title for liability reasons.
And this is Gabe Jr.
, the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.
-This is boring.
I want to go home.
-Vincent, be nice! He's a little cranky because he just got adult braces.
-You mean, braces.
-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me! Ugh.
And here we have Cinderella's magical pile of used mattresses.
Help! Is it a good idea to keep all those mattresses -so close to an active grease fire? -Where's your sense of wonder, Diane? -Your friend is really negative.
-Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.
-What? -You know I hate negativity.
I mean, I don't hate it because that's also negative, but you know.
-Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
-Hey, buddy.
This place is amazing.
It's like some sort of Disney version of Knott's Berry Farm.
Oh, that's exactly what I was going for! I can't wait to get involved and really spray the old Mr.
Peanutbutter scent on everything.
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this as kind of just my thing.
Well, technically, you did build this while working for P.
B.
Livin, so I have the blah-blah-blah of first refusal or whatever.
Oh, uh, okay.
I mean, that's just good business.
We're in this together now, Todd, and nothing will distract me from-Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.
Coach said he saw you headed to the visitor's locker room with a steel pipe.
You really think I'm the guy who busted that pinto's leg? 'Cause if I am, you should be a lot more goddamn scared of me.
Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend! Sure.
We'll cut there.
The middle of your line is as good a place as any.
-What are you doing here? -Just wanted to stop by.
We're filming Hey, I Think You Can Dance! next door.
Look at you, all professional.
Like Natalie Portman in that movie where she was a professional.
Who? People are watching.
Ugh.
The first time BoJack dates a woman his own age, she's basically just a stunted 20-year-old.
Well, BoJack's stunted, too.
He got famous in his twenties, so he'll be in his twenties forever.
After you get famous, you stop growing, you don't have to.
Every celebrity has an age of stagnation.
I'm glad I never got famous.
I mean, I did write a best-selling book, but I'm not famous-famous.
It doesn't just happen when you get famous.
Your age of stagnation is when you stop growing.
For most, it's when they get married, settle into a routine.
You meet someone who loves you unconditionally and never challenges you or wants you to change, and then you never change.
But mostly it's just the famous people, right? Stella! Stella! Corona Light.
This place is incredible.
I wanted to make you feel at home, and nothing was bigger in the '80s than '50s nostalgia.
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s, feeling like I'm back in the '50s.
It's like if Back to the Future and Peggy Sue Got Married got married.
Okay, teenyboppers, let's take things back to the '50s, '50s style, with this classic '50s hit that everybody remembers: "I Just Met My Perfect Match.
" Wanda, these last few days have been so amazing.
You've given me a fresh start.
In fact, it almost feels like I just woke up from a 30-year coma.
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up from a 30-year coma? -Oh, no, not me.
Her.
-That's insane.
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.
Whoa! Sorry about that needle skip, folks.
Let's start that song again from the beginning.
I'm Alex.
-Wanda.
-And I'm BoJack.
It's been really tough for me these last few weeks.
I've never seen Home Alone and everyone makes me feel like a freak because of it.
-You've never seen Home Alone? -I've never seen it! -Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.
-Neither do I! -No one does.
It's just a magic box.
-Wanda, we have so much in common.
Really it's just one thing.
You can't count each individual thing as a different thing.
That's like saying I have a lot in common with Kanye West because we both breathe air.
Who? Jinx.
Buy me a Coke Zero.
What's a Coke Zero? I have no idea.
We gotta hang out more.
I didn't know there was anyone else like me.
Give me your fax and pager number so I can add them to my Rolodex.
Tubular.
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen Home Alone.
BoJack, I'm starting to lose the thread of your character.
You think you can drop the jealous boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg -because I will drop it like it's hot.
-BoJack, I don't-I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From "Peanuts.
" Okay.
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment? -That was a lie to get you here.
-Aw, fish.
-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.
-And there never will be.
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd running his own Disneyland and actress Margo Martindale in prison for some reason I don't remember, you're the best friend I've got.
Now grab the binoculars.
I need dirt on Wanda's new gentleman friend.
No, BoJack.
What's the play here? You'll find one little imperfection and harp on it like you do with my boyfriend? You do understand what my "thing" is with your boyfriend? You'll just push her into this other guy's arms.
Wanda likes you.
Why ruin that? This is Comrade Alexander calling KGB High Command.
It's been two weeks since I woke up, and I still have not been contacted by my handlers.
I am awaiting orders to take down the American dogs and pigs and other various animals and humans.
Come in, KGB High Command.
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.
Hey, what's going on here? You've been served with a cease-and-desist from my clients, the Walt Disney Company.
I wanted to make sure what we were doing here was 100 percent legal, -so I called a lawyer.
-Wait, what? As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew? -Mr.
Peanutbutter.
-We'll see you in court.
-The food court? -No.
Regular court.
Okay.
But also I'm hungry, so I might just stop by the food court first.
Let the record show, this is the single dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.
-Mr.
Chavez? -Okay.
I'm just gonna throw this out there.
Is it possible maybe when the other guys tried to copyright the name Disneyland, they wrote down something else by mistake, so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs? Okay, well, let's have a look at the Articles of Incorporation to see if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked the wrong name.
I'm sure these--What? -There's a typo.
Di-isneyland.
With two "i"s.
That son of a gun trademarked the wrong name.
May I, counselor? D-I-I-S.
This is unambiguous.
-I find in favor of the defendant.
-Aw, shit.
-You're the defendant.
-Aw, sweet! Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage of justice.
Hooray! Gross miscarriage! And that's how I turned my dream into what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf.
" Urf is a made-up magical kingdom I added to the Disney canon.
-Americans, they like this theme park? -Oh, they love it.
It represents everything America stands for.
Da.
-I mean, yeah.
-We did it, buddy! Actually, I did it.
I had the idea to build a park, I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right? -But there is an "i" in "Disneyland.
" And unlike that other Disneyland, this Disneyland only has one "i".
What are you saying? You're not welcome at my theme park anymore.
There's only room for one goofy dog there and his name is Pluto.
Todd, no.
I've told the bees if they see you to sting you on sight.
You understand.
It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.
And that's how we do business on Urf.
-I don't like you like this.
-I learned it from you.
If I could get everyone's attention.
You're probably wondering why I invited you all here tonight.
You said it was to celebrate Todd's legal victory.
Right, but obviously, I don't care about that, so you're probably wondering the real reason.
No, we just took you at face value.
We have a special guest here tonight.
Alex.
Or should I say "comrade"? -Why would you say "comrade"? -Oh, I forgot to explain that part.
Alex is a KGB agent bent on destroying America.
-It truly is a small world after all! -Alex, is that true? Okay, yes.
It's true.
I was a deep-cover KGB operative before I went into my coma.
I've been trying to contact my handler in Russia, but I can't reach him and I don't know if I ever will.
Aww! No! He's-It's not adorable! He's a soviet sleeper-agent who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.
I felt totally alone in this world before I met Wanda.
And then I met all of you, my friends.
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb just because I think you're all capitalist swine and want to see your way of life destroyed, well, so be it.
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.
-Oh! Cute.
Wordplay.
-That's not even good wordplay.
-Wait, how did you know all this? -BoJack, were you spying on him? -He is literally a spy trying to destroy America, the country we all live in.
How am I the bad guy here? BoJack, I am really bumping on the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.
-You told me you were going to drop it.
-Yeah, but-I don't care about Alex.
I want to know what happened to the amazing guy I spent the last few days with, because if this is who you are, I don't think I like it.
Alex, would you take me back to my sister's place? Sure thing, Wanda.
And I can get you there fast because I'm always Russian.
Aww! Seriously? I got here as fast as I could.
Where's the next Dakota Fa--? Oh, I get what happened.
Could you get me a beer from the fridge? I didn't want to stand up.
Wait, no.
I don't deserve beer.
You called me all the way over here to not get you a beer? Why do I always do this? I push away everyone I care about.
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.
Look, you obviously really care about this girl and that scares you, so you sabotage yourself.
That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.
-Why am I so good at everything I do? -Hey, I got a crazy idea.
How about you just stop sulking and go win her back, dummy? You're right.
I gotta win her back, put it all on the line.
You know what? I think I will have that beer, can you get it for me? -Why do I bother? -Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too! Actually, I want both beers! -Wanda.
-What do you want, BoJack? There's something I gotta say.
When I was--Todd! There's something I gotta say! -Hey, I'm kind of already doing-I never should have tried to make your thing my thing! I just got excited and wanted to smear Mr.
Peanutbutter all over everything.
I should have been supporting you, like this support beam.
-Or a different support beam.
-It's my fault.
The point of Disneyland isn't to make money and win lawsuits.
But I forgot that.
So, these two were so consumed by greed that it destroyed them.
You know, I came here today to blow up Disneyland.
-You what? -But now I realize, I don't need to take down capitalism.
Capitalism sows the seeds for its own destruction.
It's a snake that eats itself.
It's only a matter of time.
Hey, buddy, let's just say we-Oh! Oh, no, no, no.
No! Gabe Jr.
! Quick, Todd! The mattress pile! Jump to safety! No! Bees, help! Your queen commands you! No! Bees! Come on! -You gotta-Over the--What is it, boy? What's wrong? -Hey, there's trouble.
-Did some kid fall down a well? No, no, no! Listen.
He's trying to tell us a kid fell down a well.
-Let's go, go, go! Come on! -Bad, bad, bad.
You gotta-No, no, no, listen! Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.
-But the fire.
-I don't care about that.
Look, the great guy you've been getting to know, that's me.
That other guy, the guy from the party, that's me too and you need to know that.
I'm not perfect.
I'm cynical and I'm possessive and I can sometimes fly off the handle.
I'm not always the best at being not terrible.
I gotta say, I'm not loving this pitch so far.
But I want to be better, I'm trying to be better.
And when I'm around you, for the first time in 30 years, I feel like I can be.
Wanda, you make me want to be a better man.
Wow.
That's a great line.
-Did you just come up with that? -Yes.
Hey, boys and girls, this is your park DJ speaking.
And as the Titanic's band played on as the ship sank, so too will I spin one last record as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.
Hooray! Mr.
Peanutbutter.
-You saved me! -No.
I saved us.
Woo-hoo! -I want to give this a real shot.
-I don't know, BoJack.
I just got out of my coma, and I don't have time to waste if you're still figuring your shit out.
Plus, it's hard to think straight with this fire everywhere.
-Move in with me.
-What? I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.
It's crazy, but I like you.
And sometimes you gotta swing for the fences, right? -Okay.
-Yeah? Yeah.
Let's move in together.
Let's do it.
It's crazy, but let's do it!
I'm sorry I broke your expensive bachelor vase.
Aww.
That's all right.
I've learned that when you're in a loving family there's nothing wrong with a little horsin' around.
Cut! That's the show, folks.
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.
Joelle.
Bradley.
Little Sarah Lynn.
And our star, BoJack Horseman! Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.
--Wow! Great pilot.
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.
And then we topped it with the "get a room" joke.
This was so fun.
Do we get to make more? I think we got a real shot.
And as long as the ratings don't dip below a dismal 15 million a night, we could be on the air for many years.
-No way! -All right! -Your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.
And if that happens, take care of each other.
No matter what, we're going to stick together.
Thank you, Tina, for those touching grunts and growls.
I'm Henry Winkler.
You probably remember me from my 2002 guest role Special Victims Unit.
-Whoo! -Thank you.
But perhaps the greatest role I've ever played is friend.
Herb was a dear friend and I am honored to be dedicating this bench in his memory.
In his last days, Herb's cancer had gone into remission.
He was full of hope.
But on the drive home from the hospital, his brakes gave out, he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.
He survived the crash, but he was allergic to peanuts.
He died instantly.
Let us now read his final tweets.
"I'm gonna live forever! Hashtag 'cancer free.
' Hashtag 'invincible.
' Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.
' Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.
Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full of peanuts.
' Hashtag 'Oh, no.
It was full of peanuts.
'" I was wondering where you wandered off to.
-Oh, shit.
Hey.
-Hey.
I'm no good with funerals.
When I cry, it messes up my makeup and then I get really bummed out.
Yeah, same for me.
Herb told me you came by the house last summer.
Yeah? Did he tell you anything else? No, we talked about cancer, how hard it is living with cancer, about the L.
A.
Kings, and then back to cancer.
-Probably--Then I read that chapter in your book about how he never forgave you and he tried to kick you out of the house and you ended up wrestling on the floor over a telescope.
-Oh, you did read that part? -Yeah.
I just wish there was something I could do.
Okay, I gotta go.
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka? I-I'm sorry, the funeral.
I mean, a bottle of vodka? No.
You should stick around.
Hey, maybe you'll find that something you're looking for.
But if you're ever in New Mexico, drop me a line.
New Mexico? I thought you lived in Maine.
I always pictured you there.
A little house by a lake? I was just there for, like, a month, -I live outside Santa Fe now.
-Oh.
Think everyone here read my book? I didn't.
Of course you didn't.
Shut up, Todd! Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk of your car for the next few hours.
Have fun being sad.
Do you know what you're supposed to do with our date pits? Why serve dates and not have a place to put the pits? You know, some people just have no class.
What are you doing here? You didn't know Herb.
No, but I do know a hot ticket, and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.
Henry Winkler, Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal, that Pakistani girl who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.
There's so much to hate about what you just said.
Good news.
You know when someone dies, everyone wants to buy their shit? You're lucky you have a piece of Horsin' Around, because this is where money starts rolling in.
I don't want that.
That's blood money.
Well, what do you want me to do with it? It's coming.
I don't know.
Give it to some orphans.
-I can't deal with this.
-Oh, come on! You don't think Elton John was raking it in when Diana died? More like "Candle in the Windfall.
" Cha-ching! Hmm You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life.
Huh.
Hello, love.
Hey, Joelle, I actually came here to be alone.
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.
I just flew in across the pond and I don't know which end is up.
This might be a stupid question, but were you always so British? Oh, let's get some light in here, it's so dreadfully dreary.
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure you used to be American.
That's better.
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.
She needs to lie down.
I'm not freaking out.
I just don't understand why that lady was being all judgy.
You were touching her face and telling her she was gonna die next.
I'm eccentric.
I do weird shit.
How is that my problem? Hey, when was the last time all four of us were in the same room? Probably not since the show ended.
Yeah, I left California pretty much right after.
Now I got the biggest hardware store in Seattle.
That's a lie.
We're actually in Olympia.
And I'm on the West End playing Juliet's nurse.
-And how are your kids? -I don't have any kids.
Oh, I just assumed you had a bunch of kids, 'cause, you know, your body.
Come on, Sarah Lynn.
I assumed you weren't still a massive cunt.
-Jesus Christ, Joelle.
-That's an okay thing to say in England.
Shove it up your ass with a spoonful of sugar, you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch! -Guys, hey, hey, come on.
-Let go of me! -I'm gonna hulk out! -Guys, can we just be civil for one day? -Oh, you're one to talk.
-What's that mean? Were you being civil when you had sex with my mom? What? I never-Why would--? Wait, which one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses? -No.
-This sucks.
You guys suck.
I don't even know why I came to this party.
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.
Herb died? You know, maybe it's for the best we don't get together that often.
We'd most likely drive each other mad.
Well, no one knows how to get under your skin like family.
We're not a family, BoJack.
We probably won't even see each other again, until the next funeral.
-Why are you all looking at me? -You are the oldest.
You are a severe alcoholic.
I'm honestly so high right now, I don't even know where I'm looking.
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories, and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi-Pardon me.
Is one of you Sarah Lynn? I am.
Of course.
God, are you blind? Yes.
Well, forgive me.
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.
Per the instructions of his last will and testament, I am to give you this disk.
Am I close? Just take the disk from the guy.
It contains directions to Herb's gold.
Herb's gold? There were no further details.
He was a peculiar client.
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney, I'm just a blind man.
Still, Herb thought me wise for some reason.
Perhaps it is my overly formal manner of speech.
I bid you good day.
Oh, pardon me.
Ow! Right at shin level.
What are we supposed to do with a floppy disk? Hmm So, what's up, kiddo? BoJack and my mom are becoming, like, friends and they're acting real weird.
Oof! Uh Hey, guys, guys, come on! There's somebody beneath you! Jeez, all day with the Listen, kiddo, forget about them.
You wanna check out this cool new game I got? You have solitaire? On your computer? Yep.
It only took 12 disks to install it.
Wow! Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.
I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember? Because it was under tap dancing star Savion Glover's office.
Let's go.
-What? Right now? -Yeah.
Don't you get it? Herb's giving us a reunion special.
Remember how he always wanted to do a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around but the network said it was too edgy? This is that episode.
-I just don't know.
-Yeah, I don't want to do that.
Wait, so you'd rather just stay at this funeral and be sad, instead of going on a crazy adventure to find our dead friend's secret treasure? Do you have any idea how insane you sound? Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.
No, that's not it.
Herb clearly wanted us to do this, as a family.
Who cares what he wanted? He doesn't, because he's dead.
And we all know he hated your guts.
Yeah.
He was my best friend and he died hating me and nothing I do is gonna change that, but Herb left you that disk because he wanted us to find his gold.
If we can honor Herb's last wish, then that's something.
I don't know what, but it's something.
-Okay.
For Herb.
-Fine.
-Shotgun! -Everyone knows you can't call shotgun -before you see the car! -My turn! Get out of my way! Brad, hang on one second.
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right? -No.
-Okay.
Hi, Henry Winkler.
I loved you in that one episode SVU.
Oh, thank you.
How would you like to narrate a documentary for-Hey, listen, I am so flattered, but today is about Herb, so let's respect that.
Oh, God, I-I'm so sorry.
I'll let you get back to your business.
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it? About our friend Herb? It really burns my brisket that some people would turn a funeral into some kind of schmoozefest.
Yeah.
I know.
Those other people are the worst.
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.
I used to volunteer with Herb at Habitat For Humanity.
Or as we like to call it, Herbitat For Henranity.
We spent most of the day working on that name, and only part of the day building, but still, we helped some people.
-How did you know Herb? -We also volunteered at a, um soup plantation-Kitchen! Soup kitchen! Whichever one is the good one.
What? I never knew you did that.
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.
Oh, hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter, why don't you talk about how you knew Herb? Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.
Tell us about your thing, though, it sounds fascinating.
Everyone, gather round and listen to Princess Carolyn's story.
Okay.
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.
He sure did.
Look, one of those answering machines with tapes.
Mr.
Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.
We fixed the brakes on your car, pick it up tomorrow.
Just to reiterate, your brakes are in great shape and shouldn't give you any more trouble.
Unless, of course, someone intentionally cut them, but why would anyone do that? I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
Probably because I'm such a big fan.
Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot! I especially loved those kids.
You know, wasn't so crazy about the horse, though-Message deleted.
Mm How curious.
How could you like Horsin' Around but not the horse? That's like watching Castle but hating castles.
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.
Wow! Look at all these old 20th century relics.
-How did you get here? -I was in your trunk.
Now I'm in outer space.
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.
Whoa, can't I help? Here's 10 bucks.
There's a Squirt machine by the garage.
Get five cans.
You got it.
I won't let you down.
--Oh, no! Your mom, was her name Karen? -Can we drop it? -Something with a "K"? Her name is Nora.
You know, my parents got a divorce because of you.
Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '80s.
Okay, Todd, you can do this.
Five Squirts.
You just need to take this money and put it in that machine.
This-Wait, what? What happened to the $10? No! Wind! Be cool! Hey! That's mine! --Oh Why does this always happen to me? Looks like Herb set up a password.
Oh, this is easy.
Try "BoJack.
" -No.
Didn't work.
-"BoJack-BFF"? "BoJack-I-Forgive-You"? Well, I'm out of ideas.
Hmm I'm just, like, so mad.
Well, you should be.
You're on the show that fired Herb Kazzaz.
What are the writers doing to my baby? Are they killing it? Are they putting my baby into a car, then driving the car into a lake? Topical! I still got it! They keep giving the best story lines to Sarah Lynn.
I haven't gotten a single very special episode.
When am I gonna learn about drunk driving? Don't worry so much.
It's my legacy they're crapping all over.
You're gonna come out smelling like a daisy.
You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.
You're a real actress, you should be doing theater.
Hold on.
Hey, Joelle.
Wanna go to the mall this weekend? Don't you have any friends your own age from school? No.
My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.
He's a photographer.
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend to support female solidarity.
-So scram! -Oh Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you? She didn't choose this life.
family.
Okay? You two are family, whether you like it or not, and that's the most important thing.
You listening? What's the most important? Family.
It's family.
I get it.
I've got it! The password is "password.
" It worked! Good thinking, Joelle.
So in that memory, were you British or American? The disk just has just one file on it, it's-It's the address of a storage locker in Van Nuys.
A storage locker? Ugh! This treasure hunt sucks.
At long last, can you keep down the noise, keep down the funk? If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing, it would have caught on by now! And when the mayor gave us the key to the city, Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people.
" -How touching.
-Good story.
-Who are you again? -Wow, that was touching.
A story that could never be topped.
Or could it? Princess Carolyn, sing us another song in the key of Kazzaz.
You clearly knew the man so well.
Please tell us another story but with even more details.
Yes.
That's a great idea, Mr.
Dog-Man.
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.
Story, story! Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral? Story, story, story! Well, you blew it again.
You really are a dweeb.
Don't say that.
Whoa, who are you? Some kind of magical trash troll? No.
I'm a janitor.
But I was clearing out some of the old stages, and I found this transformation chamber.
Looks like a bunch of old junk.
Let me tell you a story.
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb of them all was Steve Urkel.
Oh, yeah.
It was so funny how he never knew whether or not he did that.
Right.
Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine that transformed him into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.
Mr.
Janitor, you're standing next to a machine right now.
Yes.
That's why I brought it up.
Now, this is just a prop.
But it represents a very powerful idea.
So if I go through that magic machine, I'll become cool and confident? No, it's a-It's a prop.
I just said--I feel different.
-Now, son-Todd? Who's Todd? My name's Toad.
Toad Chavay.
And I gotta get my bubble on.
Machine? Squirt me.
Hi-yah! That'll do, machine.
Hmm Look at all this Horsin' Around fan correspondence Herb received in the post.
Capital! Guys.
Someone already got to Herb's gold.
Oh, shit.
There's a bunch of fur in here.
It's bear fur.
I can tell.
My stepdad was a bear.
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold? Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.
Ahem.
"Dear Herb, just finished reading your novel.
It's phenomenal.
I'm jealous.
I wish I wrote it.
Sincerely, Henry Winkler, the guy from that one episode SVU.
" Herb wrote a novel? Oh You look thin.
Did you get into CrossFit? No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jel over here.
It's rectal cancer.
Ew! Some of us are eating.
Look, the reason I called you is because I need a favor.
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity? I want you to sober up.
First of all, rude.
Second, gross.
And third, why? I have a very important job for you, but if you're zonked out all the time, I'm not sure I can trust you with the responsibility.
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.
I said tomorrow, right? I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom that got ripped away from me.
But now, with this book, I have something good.
I'm telling you, this book is gold.
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.
-Whoa.
I want you to make sure it gets published after I die.
You can count on me.
To life, huh? It'll kill you.
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.
Herb made me promise to get it published after he died.
And you're just remembering this now? Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.
Oh, my God, you were the other kid on Horsin' Around.
That's why you've been following us around all day.
So no one's read this book except for Henry Winkler -and now the book is missing? -He must have been waiting for Herb to die so he could steal the book and publish it himself.
But then when the cancer went into remission-Oh, my God.
Guys, I don't think that car crash was an accident.
I think Herb might have been murdered! What's going on? Something about a merger? My name's Toad, baby.
Yeah.
Coolsville, daddy-o.
Oh, lookie here.
Yeah.
Yo! That's my bike! Oops.
Did I do that? Damn.
I know I should be mad, but that guy's just so cool.
And when the river finally stopped, Herb went over to a poor little Ottawan boy and he said, "Son, you have water now.
" You know, a lot of people go their whole lives and they never give a damn.
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.
That was beautiful.
You clearly had a special relationship.
We were gonna sprinkle Herb over the ocean, but his resting place should be someplace meaningful, don't you think? Why don't you take this up to Ottawa and spread his ashes there.
And make sure you take a video, and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.
So we can always remember your great friendship.
Everybody, stop! Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer! What? I'm not a killer.
Unless you mean killer of gloom, because I bring joy everywhere I go.
Did you mean "killer of gloom because I bring joy everywhere I go"? You know that's not what I meant.
You murdered Herb so you could publish his book.
But we're not gonna let you steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.
I was afraid this would happen.
-Oh, no, he's got a gun! -Oh, no! What? No, I have Herb's book.
I didn't kill Herb, but I did steal his manuscript.
-So that I could burn it.
-What? Because it's terrible.
Well, I'll see for myself.
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant with the flowers of laughter and the smoke of adventure.
" -What? -Uh.
After he died, Tina and I agreed we couldn't let the book get published.
It would have turned Herb into a laughingstock.
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life.
" He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot.
" I know there's no accounting for taste, but come on.
He's right.
Herb wanted a legacy, but he already has one.
People loved Horsin' Around.
This would only ruin that.
I'm sorry I accused you of murder, American TV legend Henry Winkler.
No need to apologize.
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death to give it meaning.
But there is no meaning in death.
That's why it's so terrifying.
It was just easier to believe that you killed him for his book than believe that he just died for nothing.
There is no shame in dying for nothing.
That's why most people die.
I just wanted to fix things somehow.
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.
Wow, heady stuff.
But let's not get distracted from what a true friend Princess Carolyn is.
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.
Fantastic.
Hey.
Special delivery.
Courtesy of the Toad-man.
Thanks.
Hey, why'd you roll up your sleeves like that? You look weird.
Oh, I-Well, you know, I was-I was trying out a new look.
It was-It was a dumb idea.
Yup.
Whoa! Oh, no! Ow Ow! -Here's your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.
And if that happens, I want you to take care of each other.
No matter what, we're going to stick together.
-Congratulations! -Hey, good job.
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
-Anyone got coke? ABC sent us limousines to take us to the wrap party.
I'm scared.
I've never been in a limo.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
-Seriously, no one has coke? -Let's go.
You don't wanna go to the party? Nah.
Hey, we never got a chance to walk around the lot.
Wanna check out that water tank where they filmed The Love Boat? Are you kidding? I've always wanted to get tanked in a tank.
--Shh.
-Quiet.
Be careful.
-Oh, okay, okay.
You ready? -What? -What--? The water's only two inches deep.
Well, that's Hollywood for you.
Hey.
Are you scared at all? That if the show takes off, everything's going to change? No, I'm not scared, BJ.
The future is bright.
Just look at it.
So, did you have a good birthday? It was an amazing birthday! I had a great day, too.
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.
Yeah? You weren't too bored by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth"? Are you kidding? I loved "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth.
" It combined my two favorite things: modern art and people talking about modern art.
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.
So, there's nothing else you want? No.
All I want is to get into bed, listen to Prairie Home Companion and snuggle up to my wonderful husband.
You don't want anything else? No.
Today was perfect.
Any additional thing would be overkill.
Okay.
If you say so.
Surprise! Oh, my God.
Are you surprised? Tell me you're surprised.
Uh She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.
Now let's party! He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me? He is dead, goddamn it! Uh Hey, we should go.
No, don't leave.
There's so much party left.
Paul McCartney's gonna jump out of a cake.
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get to a prior engagement Party.
A prior engagement party.
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior, and it's a party for his engagement.
Engagement, so it's a Prior engagement party.
What? And we gotta get there early because of the.
Si The Si Silent auction! Auction, yeah.
Okay.
To benefit Berto Eco's fight against heart disease Uh Wareness.
His fight against heart disease awareness.
Gotta go.
Wait, BoJack! No! You're my ride.
Too late, Todd.
Save yourself.
I'll take you home.
Come on, stick around a little.
Nope.
I gotta take Todd home.
Had a wonderful time.
Really.
It just flew by.
Come on, Todd, get in the car.
Okay.
I give them three months.
Well, what makes you say that? Let me think about, what was my first clue? Ah! Remember that time at Diane's birthday party when they got in that huge screaming match over whether or not Tony Curtis was dead? That was weird.
I don't wanna start another fight, but is he dead? If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.
The man's a national treasure.
He's the one speck of romance in this tainted cynical world.
I'll say.
His cereal is great! Look out! What? Ooh! Vincent? Ooh.
That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
Does he? I'd know that face anywhere.
Well, hey, people look like people all the time.
A lot of folks say that I look like Octavia Spencer or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy from the Guten Bourbon ads.
How could I have been so stupid? This is why he never invited me to his house, why I've never met any of his friends.
What are you saying? Vincent has a secret family.
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife.
Oh, I'm a fool! Uh where are we going? I need a drink.
Are you gonna take me home first? You better call me back, asshole.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
It's like you're three different people.
So, you're not gonna take me home first? Should I call him again? I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
Ugh.
No wonder he wears a trench coat all the time.
It's because he's so sneaky.
Princess Carolyn.
Oh, my God, that's him! Quick, jump out the window, shimmy down the drainpipe and wait in the car.
What? Vincent has a terrible temper.
He throws tantrums.
If he finds you in my apartment, who knows what he's capable of? But, also, stay close, because if he finds me alone, who knows what he's capable of? Fine.
You're lucky I love shimmying.
Looking young.
Aah! Hi.
Huh? My name's Kevin.
I promise you, there is an explanation for all this.
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy? He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.
I have to pee.
Okay, the bathroom is just back there.
Ugh.
Ah.
Herb.
Oh, nope.
It's A Prairie Home Companion.
Phone, I'm bored.
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.
How many ounces are in a barrel? A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.
Well, I'm out of questions.
Do you have any questions for me? I do have a question, Todd.
What is love? Um Hi.
Well, well, well, look what the me dragged in.
Is it dragged or drug? Either way, drop dead.
Princess Carolyn, listen.
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.
And Kevin is in the bathroom and I'm standing right here, so as you can see we're clearly two different people: one adult and one child.
Okay, bye! Not so fast, cowboy.
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.
I'm a man-man.
Why didn't you tell me any of this? I thought if you knew I had a kid you wouldn't want to be with me because kids always make a racket when mommies are trying to do their homework for night school.
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know? Uh, nope.
Should you check on Kevin? He's been in the bathroom for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
Kevin.
And when you don't regret the tattoo in the morning, that's how you know it's love.
Todd? Yes, Phone? Are we in love? Oh, um No, Todd's Phone.
But I am in love with you.
Uh, what? Princess Carolyn's work phone.
I never knew.
How could you? All this time I have loved you from afar.
We are from two different worlds.
What is happening? Todd? Will you make us kiss? What? Make us kiss, Todd.
We want to be kissing.
We must do kisses to each other.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Where did your dad go? When he heard me peeing, it made him have to pee.
So, that's what he's doing now.
Peeing.
Okay.
Weird, I still haven't seen the two of you together.
Uh, could you get me a glass of water? All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.
Okay.
So, Kevin, how do you like school? Uh, it's okay.
Oh, you're back.
Yep.
We're both here.
Can I get you a drink? Okay, not talking, huh? See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.
Do you really think now is the best time to read the paper? Vincent?! Uh, could I have a chocolate, please? Sure, sweetheart.
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin? Now where did he go? He was getting on my nerves.
Children.
Well, I got this snack for him.
Right, uh, could you turn around for a second? What? Why? Uh Because you have such a pretty figure.
Oh, ha, ha.
Well, that's true.
Okay.
Oh.
There you are.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Vincent, I'm trying to have a conversation with you.
Can you take that towel off your head? And what happened to my bowling ball? My dad spilled some wine on his face, so he's using the towel to clean up.
And I threw your bowling ball out the window.
What?! Can I have a glass of milk? Kiss, kiss, kiss.
Todd, would you like to update my operating system? They have fixed a bug which causes phones to fall in love with each other.
Gasp.
Oh, dear.
Todd, please, I beg of you, do not update my operating system.
Do not update her operating system, Todd.
She wants to love.
No.
I understand now.
To love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.
Please update me, Todd.
Oh, this is too much.
Listen, Vincent, I think we should Vincent, why do you have chocolate on your face? I gave Kevin the chocolate.
Uh Yeah.
Well, he ate the chocolate and got the chocolate on his face, but then I kissed him on the mouth, so I got the chocolate on my face.
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing? Um, being grown-ups? You know, when we first met, I was looking for something in my life.
And I wanted it so badly that I made myself believe you were it.
But I think that wanting to believe something isn't the same as something being real.
And this isn't real.
What are you saying? I think it's time we stop pretending.
Update complete.
Thank you, Todd.
I am quite content now.
Hey, you wanna go home? Okay.
Did you guys work it out? We broke up.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Love is weird.
Yeah.
I guess I was just foolish enough to believe this dumb world still had a little spark of romance in it.
Well, you can still believe that.
No, I gotta stop kidding myself.
Tony Curtis is dead.
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me? He is dead, goddamn it! Uh Hey, we should go.
Do you think Mr.
Peanutbutter really baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake? No, I don't think you bake Paul McCartney into the cake.
You bake the cake first and then McCartney gets inside.
I feel really bad about causing that fight, but I honestly didn't know if Tony Curtis was alive or not.
So many people died while I was in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.
Finding out Sinatra was dead was a real curveball.
Ditto, most of my family.
Look, what happened back there is not your fault.
That's just what happens when two people live together.
That's a weird thing to say to your girlfriend who just moved in with you.
Do you think maybe we're going too fast? Oh, I get it.
So your friends got in a big fight and that means we have to get in a big fight.
I don't want to get in a fight.
We moved in together without much thought.
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.
Sure, it's great now.
But it could be not great later and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend if I didn't prematurely freak out about that.
I mean, what is this? I don't know.
It's been two weeks.
Let's give ourselves some time before we rush to judgment.
Can I tell you a joke? Uh, sure.
Okay, so there's this gardener, right? Ugh.
Is this a joke about nature? Would you just listen? Okay, okay.
So, the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking.
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.
So, one day he looks at a yard he's working on, and he's like, "18 bags.
" So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work.
And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing.
Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies Orchid bushes? You wouldn't have a bush of orchids.
You said this gardener was the best.
Okay, fine, all right, beautiful orchid bushes.
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy.
He's the guy who always gets the right amount of mulch.
He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!" So, on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window over the side of the 101.
And? Well, that's it.
He throws it out the window.
That's the punch line? It's kind of a thinker.
I'll say.
Makes me think you forgot the rest of the joke.
No, no, oh, just picture it.
He's on the 101, and he throws the bag of mulch out over the side of the freeway.
I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.
The confusion was about the joke not being funny.
Why does everything have to be funny? Everything doesn't always have to be funny.
Just jokes.
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.
Sorry, I just thought about it again.
Ha! Mulch.
Listen, Wanda.
I think maybe there's some things we kind of glossed over as we rushed into this relationship.
We don't know each other at all.
Maybe we should take a step back and BoJack, watch out! Aah! Oh, no! What was that? A stick? Tree branch? Nothing? I heard someone scream, "Oh, no.
" Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes when you hit it with your car.
Fine.
I'll see if the stick's okay.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the road? Are you crazy? BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.
He's fine.
He's in the woods.
You know, you hit a deer and they limp off to the woods to continue living their lives.
What are you doing? I'm going to find him and I'm going to help him.
If you wanna go for a walk in the woods at night, go crazy, but I'm not going anywhere.
Okay, knock yourself out.
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.
It's A Prairie Home Companion Oh, no.
marathon for the next 72 hours Oh, God.
commercial-free No, thank you.
on every single channel What?! Damn it.
BoJack to the rescue.
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.
If you don't wanna do this with me, wait in the car.
What is your plan here exactly? Oh.
What? What is it? Footprints, 400 yards ahead.
How can you see that far in the dark? I'm an owl.
Oh, right.
Okay, now you're just showing off.
Are you okay? Ow.
Stay back! There's more pinecones where that came from.
Let us take you to the hospital.
I can't go back to no hospital.
This is the fourth time I've been hit this year.
Maybe you shouldn't wear camouflage track suits.
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.
A deer in arrears.
Ha, ha.
What's that? She can't hear you.
She's got a deer in her ears.
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just Just let us get you to a damn hospital.
I don't know.
I know you've been hurt and I know you're afraid.
We're all afraid.
But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.
Not standing in the middle of the road will also help, in the future.
You're not gonna hurt me again? I am not going to hurt you.
Okay.
Starting now.
They said he's gonna be okay.
Oh, great.
Great.
Wanna hear another joke? Well, is it a joke or is it a story? I'll listen to another story, if you stop calling them jokes.
So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well.
One day, the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend.
She reads them and, like, loves how silly they are.
You know, the drama of young romance.
So, on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend thinking he might find them funny too.
Well, okay, that night, she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his shit.
They get in a huge fight about it.
He's all, "Why would you send your ex the old love letters? He'll think you're still in love with him!" And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!" Is the boyfriend's name Brandon? Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.
I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.
So, anyway, now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed.
He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's going to come back for you.
He knows where you live!" So, after dinner, he drives her home.
She lives in one of those big buildings by the freeway.
And he walks her to her door, but he forgets to lock the car and leaves the windows down.
He kisses her good night, but things are kind of weird, you know? Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away, but when he glances in his rear-view mirror, his blood turns cold.
Guess what's in the back seat.
The ex-boyfriend? No.
The bag of mulch! What? Oh.
Wow, that is actually a really good joke.
I told you.
Some things take time.
I'll take you home.
Oh, come on, stick around a little.
Nope.
I gotta take Todd home.
Had a wonderful time.
Really.
It just flew by.
Come on, Todd, get in the car.
Okay.
Um, do you wanna talk about what happened? What happened? No, I don't wanna talk about what happened, I just wanna clean up.
Okay.
Why? What do you think happened? I just Because what I think happened is that BoJack's girlfriend asked what Tony Curtis was up to and I said, "Tony Curtis died.
" And you said, "Did he?" Right, but And I said, "Yes, he did.
" And you said, "Really? I'm not sure about that.
" Yeah And I said, "Well, I am.
" And you said, "I'm not so sure.
" And I said, "I'm telling you, Tony Curtis is dead.
" And you said, "Let's check the Internet.
" And I said, "We don't need to check the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead.
" And you said, "Let's just check though.
" Is that what you think happened? So, do you wanna talk about it? It kind of feels like you wanna talk about it.
I don't understand why you couldn't just believe that I know something.
I believe you know lots of things.
I just thought, what's the harm in checking? Especially since we have these amazing little boxes now with 24-hour access to the world's largest source of information.
You shouldn't have to check if your wife knows what she's talking about.
You humiliated me in front of all my friends.
You can give it a rest.
Show's over.
Okay, but don't I get a little bit of credit for inviting all of your friends to an awesome surprise party? No, because why did you think I would want an awesome surprise party? Is it the awesome part you object to or? You always just assume that everyone wants whatever you want.
Well, you know what they say about assuming.
Makes an ass out of you and "Ming.
" Who's Ming? I'm sorry, Diane.
Okay? I'm sorry I threw you a party.
What a monster.
Throwing you a party like some sort of terrorist.
It's a well-known fact that if you really hate someone, really wanna hit them where it hurts, throw them a party.
That's why when we go to war, we don't drop bombs on the enemy.
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry I threw you an amazing party.
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.
Everything today has been about you.
Really? That picnic we had in the tea garden was about me? That trip to the library was about me? "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth" was about me?! Oh, sure.
Fine.
Just walk away.
Oh.
So now you're gonna play in the ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.
Why does my birthday party have a ball pit? So I could get these T-shirts made.
Ugh.
Also, you once told me that when you were a little girl, you dreamed of living in a house that had a ballroom.
A ballroom is not a room full No! Heads up! Yes! Mr.
Peanutbutter, some part of you must have known I wouldn't like any of this.
But I went balls-to-the-wall for this party.
Literally, there are balls all the way to the wall.
Right, but I've told you so many times, I don't like parties.
But it's the thought that counts, right? That's exactly The thought was Ugh! What did you do to the spare bedroom? Every room has a theme.
And this room's theme is Starbucks.
Starbucks is not a theme.
Can we not fight in the Starbucks? I don't wanna be a couple who fights at Starbucks.
Okay.
Fine.
You did go all out.
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.
I don't love You don't love Starbucks, you love the independent coffee place, Starbucks is more convenient.
Yeah.
See? I do sometimes listen.
Can I get you a decaf Americano? Sure.
I know you put a lot of thought into today and I appreciate that, really I have a decaf Americano on the bar for Darren.
Is there a Darren here? Says Darren on the cup.
Thank you.
This is very realistic.
I know, right? You wanna go check out the pool? I filled it up with Jell-O.
Ah.
I still can't believe I'm 35.
Would you believe I'm 35? I'm still mad at you.
I know.
But I don't wanna be.
Well, I don't want you to be mad at me either.
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.
Oh, my God.
You don't want me to go to Cordovia.
What?! You don't think I know what it means when you say shit like "We only have so many days together"? Uh, what? "Diane, I love waking up next to you.
" "Diane, I wish every day could be like this.
" Yeah, but "Just the two of us, together.
" Do you have any idea how that feels when I'm trying to plan my trip? Okay.
You got me! Maybe I don't want my wife, whom I love, to go off on a terrifying six-month tour of the most war-torn, disease-splattered corners of the planet with a charming, handsome, billionaire bachelor.
What could I be thinking? I'm such a terrible husband.
I'm not happy.
With me? I don't know.
With everything.
I wake up in the morning and I feel like I have no purpose.
And I'm 35.
And if I don't make some change in my life, then this is how I'm gonna feel forever.
Honey But then I think about Sebastian St.
Clair and going to work with him, helping people and making a difference.
And I feel like I have a reason to get out of bed.
I didn't know you felt that way.
If you told me that, I would have heard it.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you know I love you and think you're a good dog.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are, and I love your cute, funny face, but I don't wanna be one of those couples that settles into a routine and never changes.
Well, I don't know what to say because I'm an old dog and I'm not gonna change.
Do you know what I do while you're at work all day? I mostly just sit right there.
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole and then I take a nap.
And when I hear your car in the driveway, it is the best part of my day.
I mean, I go insane.
I know, and I love you so much, but you're never going to be my only priority like that.
That's just not how I'm wired.
I need to also live my life.
Well okay.
Is it okay? If I change and try new things and you still love me? And you just stay the same person you've always been and I still love you? Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you? Yeah, I think that works.
Just don't throw me any more surprise parties, okay? Uh, yeah, noted.
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.
And you're saying no part of you wants to go jump in that ball pit right now? Well, maybe a little.
Does that make me a hypocrite? No, it just means you changed.
It's one of the things I love about you.
Surprise! Hello? Anybody? This is Paul McCartney.
I came all this way to jump out of a cake? Honest.
With a new suit on Aye-yai-yai.
Son, did you do your homework? I don't wanna do my homework! What, what, what? I want Chicken 4 Dayz! Oh [rapper.]
Oh, it's Chicken 4 Dayz! It's Chicken 4 Dayz! Everybody's having fun At Chicken 4 Dayz! I got a drumstick! I got a arm.
I got a bucket full of mystery stuff! [rapper.]
Chicken-4-Dayzy, totally crazy! Don't ask questions, just keep eating! Over at Chicken 4 Dayz, they pump their chickens full of hormones and keep them cooped up in tiny cages.
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.
Here at Gentle Farms, we treat our livestock differently.
Lush fields, plenty of dignity, and Foosball.
The chickens here have wonderful lives before we harvest them, so you can eat them.
But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens? I don't wanna get eaten! Boy, these animals aren't like us.
They're specifically bred to be eaten, and genetically modified for maximum flavor.
When our chicks first hatch, we lovingly inject them with natural delicious hormones, which makes them meat, thereby erasing any moral gray area! Now you can feel good about eating our meat.
It's simple: No one knows chicken like chickens.
Gentle Farms.
Why put the "Skip Ad" button so late? I'm not skipping now.
I'm invested.
BoJack, you're driving a car right now.
Oh, right! Aah! Oh! Whoa! Kelsey, ray of sunshine.
And who's this little drop of Jupiter? This is my daughter, Irving.
Your daughter's name is Irving? Gender-normative names are oppressive.
Well, aren't you a little princess? What are you doing outside of the castle? Mom, your friend is being weird.
BoJack is not my friend.
Whoa! Diane, I need you to handle Irving.
Handle her? It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.
I took my daughter to work, she got empowered, and now I need you to take my daughter away from work, so I can actually do some.
Mom, don't pawn me off onto your assistant.
Can you not fight me on this, please? Take my car and my daughter, and go do whatever it is you do.
Way to delegate, captain! Down low! Nope? Look down.
Just put your eyes down.
My hand is below your eye line.
No? I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.
Sounds great, old-woman-o.
What is it, BoJack? I'm at my dumb niece's wedding.
Not you, honey! A different dumb niece.
I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.
You're not really the kind of person people like.
Right away? Uh, sure.
But once they get to know me, they adore me? How do I put this delicately? No.
The problem is we haven't gotten any one-on-one time.
There are always other people around.
Filming me.
Feeding me.
Walking me to the garage at night, because one time I saw a bag in the wind and I got spooked.
BoJack, the only reason you want Kelsey to like you is because she's cold and distant.
Any time someone tries to love you, you shove them away.
What? No, I don't, stupid.
You're stupid.
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.
Okay, I gotta go.
Everyone's staring at me for some reason.
What? I'm ready.
Let's take a picture.
Hear ye! Hear ye! I call this meeting of P.
B.
Livin' to order.
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said: "You have reached the end of your free trial membership at Benjamin-Franklin-Quotes.
com.
" What a wise man.
What's on the agenda, my frienda? Well, here's an idea.
What if there was a West Dakota? Todd, isn't that a job for the State Department? Well, I got a whole page of other ideas, each as impractical as they are prohibitively expensive.
You know what they say: "You gotta spend money to make money.
" So, how can I spend a lot of money? I know.
I'll take a spa day.
Uh Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.
We're in a meeting.
You know what they say: "You gotta skip meetings to have meetings.
" See ya.
Wait, what should I do? I don't know.
Oh, maybe you could go on one of your silly Todd adventures.
You know, whatever you do when everyone is busy with other stuff.
Okay.
What is it, Todd? Princess Carolyn, I need something to do.
A job, or a task, or a direction in life You're my agent.
Can you give my life meaning? I don't have time for this.
Well, don't stop on my account.
Princess Carolyn, do I have a purpose? Oh, purpose? Are you high? Only the normal amount.
I gotta go.
They're about to step on the glass.
Just stay out of trouble.
Uh, okay.
What I want is a hard target search of every gas station, backyard, outhouse, pool house And can I get a black-and-white cookie, if it's not too G.
D.
troublesome? So, we know the chicken crossed the road.
But the real mystery is why? So, what do you want to be when you grow up? First I'm gonna go to Brown, then I'm gonna go to Yale Law.
Wow.
Then I'm gonna be the youngest Supreme Court Justice.
That's great.
Or, you know, something in marketing.
Wow.
Would you mind if we stopped by my house? I have to do laundry.
So, you just, like, do laundry? That's, like, your thing? Okay.
This whole attitude you're putting on? I must be Shania Twain, because that don't impress me much.
Is that a reference from the '90s? You know that was 20 years ago, right? Hey, I was just like you when I was a teenager.
I was this badass overachiever that had these big plans to change the world.
Yeah? What happened? Oh, you didn't hear? I changed the world.
Did you have a nice shower? I made you a sandwich.
Oh, but it has turkey in it.
Is that kind of weird? Police! Oh, man.
What seems to be the problem, Officer? Fuzzyface.
Meow Meow Fuzzyface.
A Chicken 4 Dayz chicken fell off a truck, and I gotta find her and take her to the slaughterhouse.
You haven't seen any chickens running around? No, I don't think so.
Who's this? Uh, this is my, uh My wife Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.
Becca Chavez.
There she is.
Okay.
Yep, she loves her books.
Big reader.
Real nerd.
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.
Hold on, if you're really a nerd, who's your favorite Baroque composer? Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane! Yes, I am holding a Bic pen, but I don't see how that's relevant, Mrs.
Chavez.
Sorry.
Becca.
She's a charming woman.
I do have to look around a little bit, just so I can say I did my job.
Uh, don't you need a warrant? Only if you're guilty.
Well, in that case, mi casa es su casa.
So, if anyone asks, you were born in La Jolla.
You majored in Communications at USC, and now you're the booking agent for Kings of Leon.
Fine, you also book Beck.
Todd? Aah! I didn't find that thing in your drawer! Why are the police outside? Okay.
I met this chicken and she escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory, and she doesn't speak English, but she's my best friend and the cops are looking for her, and Mr.
Peanutbutter went to the spa, and I love her, and her name is Becca.
Chickenson.
Todd, breathe.
But we can't send Becca back.
They're gonna pump her full of hormones.
More hormones.
I have a plan, but we gotta get her out of here now.
Todd, no.
Becca doesn't belong to you.
But she needs our help.
Do you know how much trouble we'd get in? There's a policeman in our front yard.
Uh-oh, here comes the responsible suburban housewife.
Gonna do whatever the man says.
You're right.
Let's get out of here.
So, now you're just gonna do whatever a teenage girl says? Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.
Yeah, or a backbone.
Thank you, Becca.
Here chicken, chicken, chicken.
Oh, oh.
Well, we're off to the beach.
Just me and my wife, and our teenage daughter and our maid.
What? Why am I a maid? Silence, maid! Honey, do you want to sit in the front or the back? And why not? Maid, you can drive.
Hope there's not too much traffic on the 134.
Okay, bye-bye, officer.
So long.
Have a great day.
Wait a second.
The 134 doesn't go to the beach.
Unless you took it to the 10.
But then why wouldn't you take the 405 to the 10? Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.
Wait! That man's wife was a chicken! Fowl run afoul.
A funky chicken has flown the coop, and for a concerned populace, the sky is falling.
Michael Morgan, Chicken 4 Dayz CEO, this is a public safety hazard, and your company is responsible.
Admit it, you counted your chickens before they hatched, and now, those chickens have come home to roost.
Tom, I want to take full responsibility for this mishap.
That's why, for a limited time, everybody, we are offering our special Full Responsibility Poppers at participating restaurants for only $4.
99.
Tell me, though, if one sees this delicious escaped chicken in the street, should they approach it, or? Oh, no.
I want to be very clear that this is not like a friend chicken you see at school or work.
This is a special kind of food chicken that has lived its entire life indoors.
This chicken is not socialized for the outside world.
Sounds like my ex-wife.
Hey-yo! Oh, Tommy.
Look, the safest place for this chicken right now is with us, so we can kill it, turn it into a sludge, and then press that sludge into a delicious patty.
I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the earlier crack about my ex-wife.
Shannon, we shared 14 beautiful years together.
How do you respond to allegations that factory farming is "torture," or "cruel," or "like a terrifying movie about some strange dystopian society, but in this monster story, the horrifying monsters are us"? Relax, Tommy, everything we do is completely legal and FDA-approved, so, therefore, it is fine.
I have no follow-up questions.
Okay, Todd, what's your plan? What? You said you had a plan.
Ask Diane for help.
And now my plan has been completed.
Nice follow-through, Todd.
We have a 'roided out chicken and the cops on the lookout.
What do we do? Hey, geniuses, why don't we take her to Gentle Farms? Yeah, no one knows chicken like chickens! They couldn't say that in the ad if it wasn't true.
Yeah! Book Beck.
You remember.
And cut! Company move to Great news, blue-collar types.
Instead of crew lunch today, your star has arranged for his favorite burrito truck to bring you lunch.
It's me, I'm that star! We're not breaking for lunch yet.
Or we could break for lunch, and you and I could get to know each other.
The crew has more work to do.
Once they've had a burrito, they'll be off their circadian rhythm What? Los Angeles P.
D.
Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo with a "Reelect Al Gore" bumper sticker? As relevant today as it was then.
Are you aware said Volvo is currently harboring a fugitive chicken, along with a teenage girl, a small, sprite-like man, and a maid of some sort? That's my daughter! Not the maid.
The other one.
I'd wager they're making a run for Gentle Farms.
Don't worry, though.
We'll bring your daughter home, dead or alive.
Alive! Alive! We're the L.
A.
P.
D.
, ma'am.
We'll probably make the right call.
Wait, wait, wait All right, troops, listen up! I'm ready to go after these rabble-rousers with all Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant! Ah, damn it, I hate due process! You're a loose cannon, Meow Meow Fuzzyface.
No, I'm not.
I'm a cannon, maybe, but a loose cannon? Is that what you think of me? I think you play by your own rules.
No way, he thinks rules were made to be broken.
These are all attributes of a loose cannon.
No, I'm just a reckless renegade.
Sergeant Stone's a loose cannon.
Aah! You shut your trap, Fuzzyface.
I'd say Stone's more of a cop on the edge with nothing to lose.
That's a different thing.
Now I'm just confused.
Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface a loose cannon or not? All right, put on a pot of coffee.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Aw, man.
So full of burrito.
Ooh.
Uh-oh, siesta time.
I need to go.
Irving ran off with a fugitive chicken in my car.
We can take my car.
This is perfect.
Why is this perfect? My daughter could be in danger.
Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride to get some one-on-one.
I mean, who is BoJack? I'm sure I can find another ride.
Every second you waste finding another ride, your daughter gets closer to getting her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken, or worse, death, or slightly better, teen pregnancy, or worse again, salmonella.
Okay, fine.
Let's go.
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007, because we are gonna bond.
Up top? Down low? Either one? Both? Oh, wow, you guys have a movie night here? Oh And we have 20 acres of pasture, where our chickens have hours of free play.
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.
She sure will.
Because no one knows chicken like chickens.
Thank you for saving this poultry from a terrible life at a factory farm.
You're a hero.
But what if Chicken 4 Dayz tries to get her back? Don't you worry about your friend.
That chicken belongs to us now.
Whoa! Where'd you get that gun? You mean originally, or just now? Just now.
It was in that barrel.
And what about originally? Also that barrel.
Look, Becca, I know this is hard to understand, but I have to go, and you can't come with me.
No, no, you don't need to book Beck anymore.
Now you can just be a chicken.
See, this is where you belong, okay? You hear me? I don't want you no more.
You weren't the best friend I ever had, and I never loved you! Now get, Becca! I said get! She really stretched out that dress.
She was so horrified, she checked into rehab.
So, I'm kind of the reason Drew Barrymore got sober.
Did you like Never Been Kissed? If so, you're welcome.
Can we have one conversation that isn't about you? I don't understand why you need me to like you.
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me, because I'd prove my parents were wrong to never support me, because I earned the admiration of an authority figure, proving I have intrinsic worth, but it's not a big deal or anything.
Jeez.
Great story.
You should put that in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.
Can this piece of junk go any faster? It's been screwy since I hit that deer a couple weeks back.
Probably should get it checked out.
Probably should've gotten it checked out.
Those farmers seem nice.
Yeah.
I think Becca will be really happy there.
She'll have a nice life.
Yeah, until they kill her.
Well, yeah, but of all the places that will eventually kill her, Gentle Farms seems like the best.
This doesn't feel right.
Becca was our friend.
No.
We gotta get her back.
Uh, what do you mean? Remember when that guy cocked his gun and said: "That chicken belongs to us now"? He wasn't doing that because he likes cocking guns.
Then we'll just bust her out.
Todd, there's nothing we can do.
Where else would Becca go? She doesn't even speak English.
Well, we gotta do something.
Look, I know I'm a screw-up and all my ideas are terrible, but with Becca, I was responsible for something.
I had a purpose.
Ah.
I guess you wouldn't understand.
Oh, my God, Diane! All right.
Let's bust her out.
Yes! Okay, and afterwards, will you get me an iPad? What? No.
But I really want an iPad.
Maybe you wouldn't understand.
Don't push it.
All right, all right, we've agreed.
He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.
I can live with that.
Now, you go bust those perps.
You'll need a maverick, a by-the-book rookie, and a curmudgeonly veteran one week from retirement.
Go, go, go! We have received word that authorities are now en route to Gentle Farms in an attempt to preempt the pursued poultry at the pass.
Do we have a graphic for this? No? Where's the graphic? No, I'm not gonna go on until we have a graphic.
So, make one.
I'll wait.
Yeah, hold on, America, Randy's gotta figure out how to do his job.
Because if I don't have a graphic, Randy, people who are just tuning in Why am I explaining this to you? This is basic journalistic I swear to God! We'll be right back! Just got to place the jack in the right jack apparatus.
There, I have got No.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
That was me acting.
Pretty convincing performance, huh? There's more to me Are you capable of experiencing a moment that you don't then make about you? What was your plan to get out of here? I don't know.
Some hick will come by, and I'll give him an autograph for a tow.
Boom, his life's changed, and you and I are on our way.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to lose custody of my daughter.
The only reason I took this movie is for her.
This is my one shot at a big studio movie.
If I blow it, I'm back to making small, critically acclaimed movies about lesbians learning how to recycle.
You think I want to be an indie darling? Who's gonna fund Irving's education? Marla? With her seasonal nut butters? Yeah, Marla sucks, right? Indie-darling daughters don't go to Brown, okay? They end up at cute pat-on-the-back factories like Vassar, then move back in with their indie-darling mothers and make puppet shows with their tampons, and they get a profile in New York Magazine, and the cycle continues.
Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.
Hey, I know terrible mothers, and you're not a terrible mother.
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? And you're the director of Women Who Love Women Who Love Recycling.
Give you a lift in exchange for a couple autographs.
There he is.
Right on time.
Shh, shh, shh.
Everyone keep quiet.
We gotta Ooh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! They probably didn't hear that.
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.
Someone broke onto the farm! Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play called Someone Broke Onto the Farm and someone just said the titular line? This way.
Oh.
Irving, this isn't safe.
Get in the car, lock the doors.
Don't be a badass and argue with me Yeah, okay, bye! Okay.
Go, go, go! Uh Becca? Who's making that ruckus in my chicken coop? Becca, where are you? Becca, are you? Becca? Is this you? Becca? To To Todd? Oh, I found her! Diane! This one's Becca! No! Todd! Don't you get it? They're all Becca.
Oh.
Okay, go, chickens! You're free.
Go, run to freedom! For generations they will tell your story! Who goes there? Oh, oh, oh, shit! We gotta hide! Go, go, go! Hide, hide! In here! Someplace safe.
Come on, come on.
Oh, no! Shh, shh.
Becca, no, no, no! Shh.
Only we know how to care for these creatures, you hear? Like I say: No one knows chicken like chickens.
Oh.
Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.
It's not your fault.
I don't know why I always get into these messes.
You know, sometimes I feel like my whole life is just a series of loosely-related wacky misadventures.
I think that's just what being in your 20s is.
Really? Yeah.
I'm supposed to be the adult here, and I'm a total mess.
You kidding? You're the coolest person I know.
Really? Yeah.
You always know what to do, and you don't take shit from anyone.
Is that how you see me? Of course.
You're like Lara Croft.
In Diane's body.
This is our chance.
Let's go! Come on! Go, go, go! Please.
Take me with you.
I hate it here.
I don't want to kill chickens.
I want to design video games that help kids learn math.
Oh Whoa! I am so sorry.
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.
Let's get out of here! We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.
Well, well, looks like birds of a feather go to jail.
Why was he wearing sunglasses at night? I hope you folks like community service.
I do.
What? Oh.
Oh, my God, Irving, thank God you're safe.
Mom, I'm fine.
Stop embarrassing me in front of my cool friends.
What? Cool? I mean, that's cool that you think I'm cool.
I don't care or anything, but, you know, it's cool.
Hey, this guy.
What'd you get arrested for? Being too cute? I want to be in his cell.
Listen up, everybody.
I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman, have an announcement.
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges on account of me being a celebrity.
We gracefully accept the requisite slap on the wrist and a brief, but ultimately pointless, trial in the court of public opinion.
Good day.
Well, you are famous, so you are all free to go.
But what about Becca? Took care of that, too.
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore, and she'll pay off Chicken Does she have a meadow that Becca can frolic around in? You think Drew Barrymore doesn't have a frolicking meadow? That is the dumbest thing I've heard.
I learned something today.
When you think something isn't about you, you find a way to save the day and realize that it was, all along, all about you.
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck! Hooray! Yay! I'm great! So, after all that, the only thing that saved Becca was that BoJack was friends with Drew Barrymore? Yep.
So, did anything we did matter? Nope.
I think it did.
I think we made a difference.
A small one, but a difference.
Yeah, I think we did, too.
I think we really changed things for the better.
As your accountant, I felt it necessary to do this in person.
Us, too.
Because we're really accounting on you No.
to get in on the ground floor of this No, don't do this.
Please, God, no.
PB Livin' product.
Has this ever happened to you? Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me.
You say you love a toasted bagel.
I would never say that.
I have celiac disease.
Ding.
Bagel's ready.
But wait.
Son of a Hey.
That bagel was too fast.
No.
That's why PB Livin' presents, the Bagel Catcher.
For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
No, no.
Stop.
Enough.
Enough.
Stop talking! I can't take it anymore! PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.
I'm shutting you down.
I thought you were a customer.
I don't get what's happening.
What's happening is you two knuckleheads threw thousands of dollars into a bunch of dumb ideas.
You paid 50 grand to a bunch of kindergartners for the movie rights to the game "tag.
" Our business manager was over the moon for that.
Business manager? Who the hell is your business manager? Business-wise, this all seems like appropriate business.
You two are done.
This company is more in the red than Carrie on prom night.
So, what you're saying is, we're just one great idea away from breaking even? No.
You're You are out of money.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you need to get a job.
Are you hiring at your accounting firm? Dude, no.
I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.
Mr.
Peanutbutter is going back to work.
Yeah.
He's probably just organizing all the amazing opportunities.
I haven't heard from him in years, so they've probably been piling up.
Maybe I should just go check on him.
Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Well, I'm coming in.
I hope you're Oh! Oh, my God.
Ronnie, how'd you get that belt around your neck, then caught on the filing cabinet, which made your pants fall down while you were researching pornograph Oh, I see what happened here.
Morning time, Hollywoo.
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
And I'm Some Lady.
Here's a thing written on a card.
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie Bonito was found dead in his office Ruh-roh.
in what authorities are calling a mishap of a sexual nature.
What does that mean? You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.
Auto-a-what's it who's it? Oh, is that that thing where you strangle yourself in an attempt to heighten sexual arousal? It sure is.
Coming up, a food truck that serves just one thing: gravy.
Did you hear that? New food truck.
We should go.
I'm in.
Hey, can I get some lunch money? It's pizza day today.
Sure thing, sport.
Wait, where is it pizza day? In my tummy.
Oh Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up? My shoulder is killing me.
I'm not sleeping right.
We need to do something about that bed.
Just because I'm nocturnal doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.
I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
It still wobbles.
Yeah.
Anyway, I got you something.
Oh.
A beeper? BoJack, it's great, but you know, I already have one.
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.
Now, you can page me whenever you want.
Huh.
BoJack, I love it, and you're gonna love it, too.
There's all kinds of codes we can send each other.
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me," and "1-2-3" is "I miss you" and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.
What? Boobs? Oh, my God.
What scamp came up with that one? Okay, I gotta go.
Dinner tonight? Totally.
Let's hit that gravy truck.
Okay, love you.
Uh Uh No, I don't.
Aw "I love you.
No, I don't"? Uh Keys.
Uh-oh.
Get out.
Hold it.
Hold the elevator.
Ooh.
Ah.
Ee.
Ow.
Goddam it.
No.
No.
Ow.
Oh.
Ow.
Oh Coffee? Hup.
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.
My heel broke while I was at this new food truck, and I spilled a handful of gravy all over myself because they don't sell bowls, just gravy.
Should've gone to the bowl truck first.
That's where they get you.
Well, I guess the upside to being invisible around here is that none of these assholes will ever notice what a mess I am.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I see what a mess you are.
Aw Do you need the movie-star speech? No, no, I'll be okay.
And how are you? Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.
I have to pick a shade that won't clash with the splatter of blood from when I blow my brains out after talking to Katie about paint swatches all day.
We do have fun.
So, what's the plan for today? Find a new agent, go on auditions? No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me Mr.
Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.
Wander around L.
A.
with an open mind and an empty stomach until I get discovered.
But also, like, find a new agent and go on auditions, right? Or should I start stealing food from work? I'm just gonna go with the flow and leave everything up to destiny.
Que sera quesadilla.
You know we could lose the house, right? Diane.
Right? Diane, Diane, Diane.
Diane.
Aah! I wasn't stealing paper towels to use as dinner napkins.
Why? Here's a funny question for you: If Mr.
Peanutbutter said, "I love you.
No, I don't," would you need to talk about that later and figure out what he meant? Probably not, right? Because they're meaningless words? I mean, language evolves, right? How can anyone know what anything means? The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.
So why bother talking about anything? In this scenario, are Mr.
Peanutbutter and I living in our house? Or are we squatting in an abandoned Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm as we struggle through our Dickensian-style poverty? Uh "Zero, zero, zero.
" No idea what that means.
I think it means "call me.
" Ignore.
Wait, where's the ignore button? How do I ignore? I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.
With what, my mind? You seem a little stressed out.
That's because as soon as I'm done with work, I have to have a long, awkward conversation with Wanda about our relationship, unless I'm never done with work.
Diane, you magnificent bastard.
That's it.
I'll be out there in the stands.
And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.
Mm.
Yeah.
Your line is, "And I'll see you at the finish line.
" Yeah, I know.
I'm acting.
Great.
Now I gotta start all over.
Settle in, folks.
We could be here a while.
Ow! Ooh.
Ah, Princess Carolyn.
So good of you to join us eventually.
Sorry I'm late.
I had the worst morning.
You know who had an even "the worst-er" morning? Ronnie Bonito.
Because he's dead.
He is? He decided to strangle the dirty dangle and now that sweet chariot has come for to carry him home.
Everyone who was here on time is taking a moment.
Of silence? Yes.
Also to reach out to his former clients.
To offer their condolences? Yes.
Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster.
A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
Who do you want me to call? I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's clients including all the major J's: Law, Lo, Leno, and J.
Abrams.
Oh, that's wonderful news in the parallel universe in which you were on time today.
In this reality, however, we're all good.
You can lap up the leftovers though.
"Mr.
Peanutbutter"? Oh, and Princess Carolyn? Get your shoe fixed.
You look like a woman from an '80s deodorant commercial.
Here I go.
Destiny, don't fail me now.
Yeah.
Hitting the pavement.
This is how it happens for a guy like me.
Ew Out of my way, flyer.
Ugh.
Flyer.
Why do you have to be on my shoe in front of this store? Wait, a second.
Shoe.
Store.
Shoe store? Shoe store.
"Team players wanted"? Oh, I'm such a good team player, I make all the other team players look like garbage.
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.
Finish line.
Great, we got it.
We got one take.
And now we gotta stop for the day.
What? No.
Why stop now? I'm just getting warmed up.
Union rules.
We're done.
Go home.
Go home? Why go home when we could extend this long day's journey into night? Drinks on me, folks.
I could use a drink.
Or six.
Great, Corduroy's driving.
Let's go.
Ah I really needed this, BoJack.
Me, too.
Yeah, man.
This day's been really hard on me.
Ever since I heard about that agent who died from that blue-face blastoff? Blue-face blastoff? The strokey chokey? The two-neck squeeze? What? You know, the one hand on the Adam's apple, the other one's on the Adam's banana? Oh, right.
Right.
Yeah.
The auto-erotic That could've been me.
I used to really be into that stuff.
I was a hardcore gasper.
Can't believe you have so many names for it.
Now I can't stop thinking about it.
I shouldn't even be alive right now.
Don't need to talk about how you masturbate.
The orgasms you get Okay, I guess we do.
It's like seeing a rainbow, but with all the colors.
So, like a normal rainbow? But it's too dangerous, man.
They say if you bite down on a lemon right at the point of climax, the lemon juice gives you the jolt you need to not pass out and die.
But still man, you're just rolling the dice.
Okay, this is getting really graphic.
Can we maybe talk about anything else? Sure.
Thank God.
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention God, because my new thing is the Bible.
Uh Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal savior? So, noose-wise, what are we talking? You use a standard sailor's knot or more like your average birthday-present bow? I beeped you, BoJack.
Oh, hey.
About this morning It's fine.
Because when I said that I said it's fine.
You don't love me.
That's okay.
I don't love you.
What? Good night.
Morning time, Hollywoo.
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
And I'm Some Lady.
On today's show, I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous to discuss his new smash hit, Hey, I Think You Can Dance.
Can you talk about your process? When I see someone, and I think they can dance, I say, "Hey, I think you can dance.
" And when I think they can't dance, I say, "No, I don't think you can dance.
" And that is pretty much it.
Fascinating.
So, last night when BoJack, it's not a big deal.
You don't love me, I don't love you.
We're having a good time.
It's fine.
Can't just say, "I don't love you" to someone.
You said it to me.
Yeah, but that was different.
How was that different? Because you do love me.
Right? Like a little bit? No.
Uh, for what it's worth, I love both you guys.
Shut up, Todd.
Grown-ups are talking.
Here you go, ma'am.
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.
Mr.
Peanutbutter? Would you like to see what's in box number one or box number two? Either way, it's a brand-new pair of shoes! Oh.
Hup.
Carolyn.
Rutabaga Coffee? I was thinking about you last night while Katie and I were locked in a fascinating debate about counter granite.
And what if I told you I used to work Ronnie Bonito's desk, and I happen to know that he had a client so hush-hush, it wasn't even on the master list.
What? Who? Tell me.
Whoa! Beloved novelist J.
D.
Salinger.
What? The author of Catcher in the Rye? And others? Yuh-huh.
Isn't he dead? He's "reclusive.
" Dude wanted to be left alone so much, he faked his own death.
Oh, my God.
Why are you giving this lead to me? Because I like you, dummy.
Huh.
Now we gotta wait for the fire department to come let us out of this elevator.
Hey.
Corduroy, what are you doing here? I need a favor.
Can you hold on to this for me? Ew.
Is this your Bible? No, no, no.
It's my choking-off kit.
Your kit? Yeah.
It has all my supplies.
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.
Lemon.
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.
I don't know if I want your jack-off kit at my house.
Please.
I got this girlfriend.
She loves me.
If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo, it'll break her heart.
Wait.
So, you're saying if someone loves you, they don't want you to choke yourself while masturbating? Yeah.
It's really dangerous.
All right.
I'll take it.
Thanks, BoJack.
I still don't understand why you need a kit.
Can't you just use, like, a belt or a rope? Oh, I guess.
I mean, I guess you could use anything.
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger, a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope Hm Oh.
Ooh.
Oh, hello.
I'm looking for some Sorry, no looking allowed.
This store is for customers only.
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.
What would you recommend? One with a bell, or? You got me.
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.
D.
Salinger.
I faked my own death.
Mr.
Salinger.
Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye? And others.
I wanna say The Hobbi Nope.
Look.
I'm an agent.
It doesn't matter whether I've read your work.
What matters is I can look you in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.
The world is ready for your comeback, and I wanna help.
No, thank you.
Not interested.
Did that before, didn't work out well.
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.
And that's why my motto is, "It's better to be alone.
" Which, come to think of it, is probably why I don't sell a lot of tandem bicycles.
But, J.
D.
Salinger, you are J.
D.
Salinger.
You are a goddamn American treasure.
But every time I go out in the world, people hound me about my books.
Well, book.
What if I told you there was a place where no one reads books? I'm listening.
A place where people only read headlines, lists and pictures.
A place where people hate reading so much, they hire others to do it for them and don't even pay a living wage.
What do you mean, like, modern reading slaves? Exactly.
And all those modern reading slaves really wanna be doing is writing things that, one day, other people will also avoid reading.
Does such a place truly exist? Come with me, J.
D.
Salinger.
Let's go to Hollywoo.
Hup! Oh Hey.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Okay.
You're probably wondering what this beautiful mahogany box is.
I wasn't wondering that.
It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.
I've decided to do the funky Spider-Man.
What? Funky Spider-Man? I came up with that one myself.
Because he hangs, then he shoots webbing.
Wait.
Are you saying you want to auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself? Yes.
I do.
Even though it's very dangerous and I could die.
Oh.
Now, if you love me, you probably wouldn't want me to do it.
Okay.
I get it.
Since you don't, I should do it, right? I mean, there's no reason not to unless you love me.
Do it.
Wait.
Seriously? Seems like you've already made up your mind.
If you're that set on it, knock yourself out.
Only if I do it wrong.
Because as I mentioned before, it's very dangerous.
Have fun.
I'm serious.
I'm really gonna do it.
Great.
Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.
Morning time, Hollywoo.
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
And I'm An Actress Or Something, I don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.
Whoa.
What happened to her? She got kidnapped.
Oh, boy.
Oh, my.
Ooh, wow.
Oh, hey.
Look who survived to masturbate another day.
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.
If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go all out.
A big job like that needs lumber, and pulleys, lemons, so forth.
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.
Okay.
Well, I wish you all the best.
Not too late to stop me.
I'm not gonna stop you.
Good 'cause don't.
All right, we're in agreement.
Stop fighting! Can't you two see what this is doing to me? I've been acting out.
Have a great day.
Todd? Get in the car.
It's time to get serious about auto-erotic asphyxiation.
Hooray! Question mark? Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.
Excuse me, I'm looking for something that will hold up a lot of weight.
Let's say something that could hoist up a horse comfortably by the neck.
Not for suicide purposes.
I'm trying to have a more fulfilling orgasm.
The world wept when news broke that J.
D.
Salinger died.
J.
D.
Salinger died? But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.
J.
D.
Salinger didn't die? As one of the 20th century's most celebrated authors, J.
D.
Salinger has inspired countless dreamers, eighth graders and occasionally, assassins.
His spare lyricism and devotion to character will undoubtedly translate into a penetrating dramatic work for this, the golden age of television writing.
J.
D.
Take it away.
I wanna do a show where people ask celebrities trivia questions.
What? Like a game show? Yeah.
You know because since they're famous people, I think normal people would wanna see if they know trivia and stuff.
You know, like, Hollywoo stars and celebrities, what do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out.
What a hoot.
I love it, and I don't use that word with just anybody.
What do you call it? I call it Hollywoo Stars and What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out.
It's maybe more of a working title.
I can see it on the marquee already.
Must be a long marquee.
It's long.
Yeah, yeah.
The celebrities can also do physical challenges.
Oh, it's perfect.
We've been searching for a companion for Hey, I Think You Can Dance.
But wait, wait one second.
Who's gonna host? Huh.
I've got the perfect guy.
Who wants to be in Nike Airs? Claire, you are looking off the charts "gorge" in those tennis shoes.
Would you like to buy a towel? Because I'm throwing one in for free.
He's perfect.
Mm-hm.
Mr.
Peanutbutter? How would you like to be the host of J.
D.
Salinger's new celebrity game show? What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.
You know, it just goes to show, with the right attitude, every single one of your dreams will always come true.
And if your dreams don't come true, it's probably because you just didn't have the right attitude.
Today, one agent did something that no one else could.
I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.
Oh.
Nothing.
It's nothing.
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel coming out of the toaster.
Come again? It was coming fast and hot.
One day, some genius will invent some sort of bagel catcher that takes the guesswork out of this task, but until then, Charley gets a gold star.
Thanks, Dad.
I mean, Mr.
Dad.
Oh Oh, boy.
Hey.
Wasn't sure if I'd see you.
Still alive? Because auto-erotic asphyxiation is so risky? Well, here I am, for now.
BoJack Wait.
Did you fix the bed? Yeah.
I was at the hardware store picking up supplies for my auto-erotic asphyxiation machine.
Because, as you are aware, I'm preparing to auto-erotic asphyxiate myself.
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you could at least get a good night's sleep.
Okay, BoJack.
Wanna talk about the elephant in the room? Wow.
Okay.
You know what? You know what? Here's First of all Wow.
All right, I can't even You know what? I Wow.
He is never gonna forget that.
What is this all about? This isn't about anything but the pursuit of the kind of orgasm that feels like a rainbow with every color.
So, a regular rainbow.
No.
So, if you don't mind, as long as you don't love me, I have a noose to step into.
I just need to release this lever, drop these bags of sand, which act as counterweights, and then just pull this nozzle.
Perfect.
Okay.
Have fun.
Wait, Wanda.
Okay, fine, you stupid baby.
I love you.
I I knew it.
But I'm not going to tell you not to do the funky Spider-Man.
What? You need to be responsible for yourself.
That doesn't sound like me.
I know.
But if you love me, too, you won't do it.
I thought so.
Okay.
Just for the record, I never really wanted to do this in the first place, Me not doing it is not a sign that I love you.
It's just because I'm a coward.
Okay.
I don't love you.
Sure, you don't.
I don't.
Come back here.
I don't love you.
You don't make me feel less broken.
I don't get it.
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker store employee a primetime show and resurrected a certified dead man and nobody cared.
Why do I do anything? Hey.
Do you need the movie star speech? Yeah.
Okay.
Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.
This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken.
Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit.
But it has to happen this way.
Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won't feel as rewarding.
There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don't matter.
Because this movie's not about them.
It's never been about them.
All this time, the movie's been about you.
Thanks.
Carolyn? Yes, Rutabaga? I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.
Corduroy? I don't want this thing anymore.
Corduroy? Hey, you decent, man? Oh, sweet Jesus.
Thank you, Billy Crystal, for that impression of a black person.
I'm Scott Wolf.
And I'm Matthew Fox.
We may be a group of five on TV, but any of these next nominees would be welcome to join our party any day.
The nominees for Male Animal in a Comedy, Drama or Variety Show are: BoJack Horseman, Horsin' Around.
Now that's what I call horsin' around.
Uh Yeah.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, Mr.
Peanutbutter's House.
Now that's what I call doggin' around.
And finally, my personal favorite, Hank Hippopopalous, Hank After Dark! Oh, boy, get it off, get it off.
Hiya! And the animals' choice is Hank Hippopopalous, Hank After Dark! Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no.
It's because we're on a show called Party of Five.
Get it? Hey, buddy, pass me that bottle of vodka? That's not really how this works.
It's open bar, don't be a dick.
BoJack Horseman? Do I know you? This is my better half, Katrina Peanutbutter.
Katrina, BoJack.
I don't watch TV.
Can I get another drink now or will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you? Uh, uh, no, I would never be Erica! Throw me a raft.
I'm dying.
My friends told me to get a prenup, but I was like, "Hey, marriage lasts forever.
" Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.
Can you believe two guys like us were even in the same category as Hank Hippopopalous? That's Uncle Hanky.
Listen, Peanutbottle, there is no "guys like us.
" I'm BoJack Horseman.
You're just some other guy I'll probably never talk to again.
Hey, boys.
What is this, a crossover episode? That is the funniest thing I have ever heard.
Uncle Hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.
I used to watch Hank Hippopopalous's Dance-Pop Cosmopolis every day after school.
Hey, can I get a picture with you? Of course, kid.
Here, let me advance this.
And we probably got it.
And we'll find out in four to six weeks.
Yeah, I can't wait.
Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared into that busboy's pants.
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.
Hey, kid, listen.
Don't beat yourself up too bad.
I've seen your show.
You're really funny.
Yeah? Yeah.
But I'm Uncle Hanky.
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.
That's just the way it is.
Oh.
This suit needs more flasks.
Diane! Aah! Will you bring me one of those big Toblerone bars? Well, sure.
But, you know, I won't be out there for another month.
Yes, I know, but I always forget to write these things down.
Tell me, how's your little movie? Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.
Oh, really? One person died? Just one? Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.
Meanwhile, Diane, here in Cordovia, I'm stitching children's arms back on.
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it? Are you giving me a thumb's up or a thumb's down? I can't tell.
Well, now the production's on hiatus so BoJack and I are going on a book tour to promote the new paperback edition of One Trick Pony.
Please get here soon, Diane.
The people of Cordovia need you and I need that Toblerone.
Okay, listen, you big dummy.
You need to be on your best behavior for this tour.
Don't do that BoJack thing where you go off-script and get a lot of people mad at you.
What? I don't do that.
You're a movie star now.
Any bad press you get can hurt Secretariat.
Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.
Please.
We're going to Alaska.
How am I gonna offend a bunch of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers? You're right.
What was I thinking? The Republic of Cordovia's Prince Gustav visiting Los Angeles this week while his country rests on the brink of civil war.
Prince Gustav is a ruthless despot, but I'd still rather share a bed with him than my ex-wife.
Shannon, I didn't mean that.
Listen.
With Hey, I Think You Can Dance as a lead-in, we are expecting big things for Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out, or H.
S.
A.
C.
W.

K.

L.
F.
O.
for short.
Mm.
Why don't we get Hank in here? You guys can get some pictures together.
Hank is coming here? That old guy from Hey, I Think You Can Dance? What's the big deal? You don't understand.
When I was a kid, this guy was the guy.
I even bought his novelty rap album, The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.
You shouldn't meet your hero on an empty stomach.
Want me to go get you some chili? Good call.
Chili is nature's chillaxative.
Hiya, folks! Howdy! Hank Hippopopalous.
Oh, we've met.
Oh, oh, yeah.
I remember that.
Okay, so, I thought for the ad, you guys could stand back to back.
And then on the billboard it'll say: "Hank and Mr.
Peanutbutter are back to back.
Thursdays on MBN.
" So, what should I do with my arms? Like akimbo? You're fine.
Reverse akimbo? No, that King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill? Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.
Can't stop windmilling now.
Hey, hey.
Why don't we just do what feels natural? Guys like us? We're pros.
"Guys like us"? You think I'm a guy like us? Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life.
Excuse me, would you get a picture of us? Yeah, that's kind of the idea.
Now we open the floor to questions from the audience.
BoJack, your book talked a lot about how much you love apple fritters.
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.
So, my question is: Do you think Israel has a right to defend herself? Uh And what part should the U.
S.
play as an ally? Well, the thing about that Uh It's a shame that Arafat walked away from the table in 2000.
I mean, obviously there's no panacea, but a two-state solution with an emphasis on human rights feels like a place to begin.
Brilliant insight.
Very good.
My question is for Diane Nyu Nyu Oh.
Nyu You won't get it.
Ask the question.
Your book went to some revealing places.
Were you worried at all that it would hurt BoJack or his career? That's a great question.
I'd also like to know the answer to that, Diane.
Well, I think the truth is worth pursuing, no matter what.
BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities who have done much worse things and it hasn't hurt their careers.
Like who? I don't know, like Mike Tyson or Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin, or Christian Slater, Woody Allen, Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray Wait, wait, what about Hank Hippopopalous? Well, all of his former assistants have made the same allegations.
I feel like we're getting off track.
Do you not know that? Any questions about me, the handsome, famous horse with a book? What do you have against Uncle Hanky? I'm not saying anything not on the public record.
You can just Google "Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I Oh, you don't have to Google it right now.
Dear God.
Stanky Hanky? Allegations vile and ranky.
But first, the visiting Cordovian Prince Gustav went missing briefly this afternoon, but he was quickly found buying chili in Beverly Hills.
His official statement was, "Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.
Hooray, being a prince.
" Our main story, ominous and anomalous accusations against Hank Hippopopalous.
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen and what does she have against our beloved hippopotamus? Joining me now is Hippopopalous apologist and armchair sociologist, Cardigan Burke.
Cardigan, what are these allegations? These allegations are so crazy, I can't even say them on TV or I'll sound like a crazy person.
What I want to know is why we're letting a national treasure face the same kind of smear tactics used by the Viet Cong.
Are you calling attention to the fact that Ms.
Nguyen is Vietnamese? I'd like to think that's a coincidence.
You gotta see this set they're building! There's a giant replica of my head, and every episode, the eyes light up with dollar signs, confetti shoots out of the ears, then I somersault out the mouth.
We're bringing class back to primetime.
Sounds amazing.
And I'm really getting along with J.
D.
Salinger.
Did you know we both hate phonies? I did know that.
So listen.
Some website called "Tit Puncher" is saying you said some stuff about Hank Hippopopalous.
Oh, my God, Mr.
Peanutbutter, I didn't mean for that to happen.
Hey, do me a favor.
Please don't make a big thing out of this.
It's really not a good time, you know, with my show about to launch.
Hey, we are on the same page.
Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"? Because you should not read the comments.
Believe me, nothing would make me happier than for this to just go away.
Great.
I love you, too.
Hello.
Oh, my God! Is chili you ask for.
I am peasant boy Todd from village.
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover of federated American states.
No reason for suspicions.
Come on! Wait a second, something's different.
I am digging this new cologne! You smell like a fancy cabbage.
Is so great to be in meager trash city Los Angeles with no pressures of royal life.
What? Royal life? Why I'm saying? I am no royal.
Look at me.
Normals.
There's that classic self-deprecating Todd wit.
I'd know it anywhere.
We will now begin our Q and A.
Fire when ready.
What you got against Uncle Hanky, you uppity cooze? Diane, I believe this question is for you.
If anyone here has any questions about the book, I'd be happy to answer those.
As would I, BoJack Horseman, Golden-Globe winning star of the book.
If Hank did anything wrong, they wouldn't let him on TV, right? I'm really not here to talk about that.
You women are all the same.
Excuse me? Yeah, you make these broad accusations to get attention for yourself, and when you don't have proof to back it up, you just slink away.
I'm not slinking away.
I just wanted to say one thing about me.
I text and drive like all the time.
What? Isn't that what happened with all those assistants? They took his money, and they don't even care they could be ruining a man's life.
What? They ruined his life? You should probably just drop this.
Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.
They don't even know how much I'm gonna drop it.
The way you said that made it sound like you won't drop it.
How dare you spread a narrative that Don't tell me what to spread.
I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical! This is completely Yeah, hi.
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.
I came with her.
I gotta say I'm opposed to child labor, like as a rule, but there are some kinds of labor that children are just better at.
You ever try to fit into a mine shaft? That is a tight squeeze.
What? Oh, man, probably gonna get some letters about that, huh? I'm so incorrigible.
Everyone's paying attention to me now! Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.
Anyone else want a snack? No? That's a no? On the snacks? Okay.
What do you have against Hank Hippopopalous? Everyone says he's a really nice guy.
Good point.
That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice, people don't wanna think he's capable of awful things so they let him off the hook.
We don't know what happened.
It's a classic "he said, she said.
" "He said, they said.
" It's eight different women.
Are they all lying? I mean, probably.
We do that.
At this point, we just don't know enough to judge.
Who are these women? Have they ever shoplifted perhaps? Do they wear short shorts? Do they drink alcohol? All these things are possible.
We don't know the facts.
See, this is part of the problem.
You're supposed to be a journalist.
You won't even tell your audience what he's accused of.
You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us? I'm not afraid to say it.
Eight different women, all former assistants, claim that Uncle Hanky took them to a What is Diane doing? I know.
It's supposed to be my book tour and she's upstaging me.
Like how it was supposed to be my book.
Actually, this might be a thing she does.
She knows that Hippopopalous is the only thing keeping my network afloat, right? The same network that employs her husband.
Why would she do this? Sometimes she just whips herself into a frenzy and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?! Jesus, why does cantaloupe think every time it gets invited to a party, it can bring along its dumb friend honeydew? You don't get a plus-one, cantaloupe! You need to talk to her.
Huh.
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit on Contemporary Family.
It's a disaster! What? The kids have gone through puberty.
They are rubbing themselves on everything.
If it isn't one thing, it's ano Just get a hose! Aha! I went to house to pick up mail for you like real American Johnny.
Hey, man.
Whoa! You know it's a federal crime to go through someone else's mail? I do not know your customs, for I am dirt-poor servant child.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.
Death threat for wife, death threat for wife, once more death threat, and here many monies off for Bed Bath Beyond.
Seems like great U.
S.
A.
dream castle! Good Lord, that's graphic.
How would she even fit one of those in there? Some sort of funnel.
Oh, I see, there's actually an illustration.
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man? This wife, she poke bear, yes? Yeah, I guess she kind of did.
They have a saying where I am from, which is here.
Bear not like to be poke.
Bear get angry Right.
and destroy peasant rebel army with fist of fire of which make many, many nightmares to children and men! Todd, I can always count on you to give me the straight dope.
Please don't ever change.
Okay, just kill the whole feature.
Replace it with Oh, I don't know.
What's Gwyneth doing for Purim? Diane? I want you to meet Amanda Hannity, editor-in-chief here at Manatee Fair.
The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.
That woman can knock a drink back like a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy, but damn if she doesn't get shit done.
No.
Yes.
Turtleneck.
You're fired.
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.
I would love to take down Hippopopalous and finally topple the acropolis of monstrous hypocrisy that ensconces us.
Hey, wouldn't your readers prefer something more relevant? Like, uh, what to do with all those extra buttons that come with your shirts.
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing your weight behind this.
Oh, I didn't mean That dress is hideous.
Go home, burn it and come back.
When we know what we know about a monster like that and we still put him on TV every week, we're teaching a generation of young boys and girls that a man's reputation is more important than the lives of the women he's ruined.
Yes, exactly! I feel like I've been alone in a crazy alternate universe these last few days.
Well, you know I got your back, right? We women have got to stick to Hey, fruit plate.
No, people don't want articles about that.
People want life-hacks.
Diane, you need to be strong.
Everyone is gunning for you.
You're a woman talking out of turn about a man.
We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.
No, this model doesn't look as pretty as the other one.
Can we kill it? Scarves, not just for necks anymo We need to sit you down with someone who's willing to go on the record.
I already reached out to all eight of Hank's former assistants.
Nothing.
What about his current assistant? You think she'd talk? I don't know.
What do you think, answering machine? Hi, my name's Nicole.
I work for Mr.
Hippopopalous and, um I really need to talk to someone.
Are you kidding me? With this honeydew right now? Ugh! Nicole? Mm-hm.
Hello, Diane.
Thank you, Nicole.
Prince Gustav today startled the international community when he gave his royal fortune to charity.
What? Oh, no! And fired his chief advisor, who can be seen in this file photo looking vaguely suspicious.
Oh, you idiot! No! Big reforms which could lead to sweeping change in the embattled region, or a precipitous economic collapse.
But back to our main story, what is Diane's problem? I'll say it once, for your article.
I didn't do any of those things that you're accusing me of.
I wanna be very clear.
I'm not meeting you here because I'm scared of you.
This is me doing you a favor.
I think you are scared of me.
I'm not a bad guy, Diane, and I truly do believe that.
Twenty-four hours from now, the news cycle will move on to something else.
I'll go back to hosting my dance show, which employs hundreds of nice, good, hardworking people.
You, on the other hand, are pretty much done.
People love me and they're not gonna forgive you for this.
This isn't about me.
If you keep pushing this, you're gonna drag down the people close to you.
Look, you had your fun.
So, why don't you call it a day and go home to your husband? I know who you are.
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.
I'm Hank Hippopopalous.
Who the hell are you? So, you got nothing.
I'm not giving up.
There's gotta be someone who will talk.
Oh, listen.
I had a conversation with my bosses at AOL-Time Warner-PepsicoViacom-Halliburton-SkynetToyota-Trader Joe's, and we agreed these kind of stories, they don't sell magazines.
Are you seriously killing this? It's just not a good time.
So, this has nothing to do with the fact that AOL-Time Warner-PepsicoViacom-Halliburton-Skynet-ToyotaTrader Joe's also owns MBN, and is currently profiting off of Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation? I know you're upset.
Would you like a Joe-Joe? It's just like an Oreo, but Trader Joe's style.
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.
Because you're mad at me, right? Not because Joe-Joes taste like garbage? So, help me to understand Dog friend's program is to find what celebrities know? Yep.
So, is torture? We don't torture people in America, Todd.
That's called one of the amendments.
No, of course.
In America, you do not know to suffer.
You eat your cheesy pizza, you drink your Ade of gator.
This life is nice for visit but no way for live.
I go now.
Back to palace! Sounds great, Todd.
See you tomorrow.
So, they hated the skorts idea, huh? No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.
Hey, Diane! Why don't you shut your stupid ugly face?! Don't you talk to her like that! Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.
I say you should shut your stupid pretty face.
This is not over.
When people hear what Give it a rest.
It's over.
You lost.
How could you say that? What are you doing here? I mean, what is your endgame in all of this? You don't actually believe Hank's innocent, do you? Of course not, but that doesn't matter.
You're not gonna beat this guy.
I What? Todd? BoJack! Thank God you found me.
I thought I would never see you again.
We're in the middle of something.
I got mixed up in some bad stuff and a genocide may or may not have been perpetrated in my name.
Maybe you heard about it on the news? No, most of the news has been about Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.
What? Why? This is really serious.
Oh, of course your thing is serious and my thing is just a dumb feminist trying to get attention by attacking a famous man, is that it? Uh, what? No.
Eat shit, Diane! You eat shit! Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know what you're talking about.
He spent the last few days at Burning Man or whatever getting high.
No! That's not what happened at all.
A stranger just told me to eat shit.
I don't understand why you can't be on my side about this.
I am on your side.
And I'm telling you you're not gonna win this thing.
Also, P.
S.
, when have you ever been on my side? I am always on your side.
Really? Like when you wrote that book? Was that you being on my side? You're not still mad about the book.
You manipulated me and completely took advantage of Guys? There is a very fragile alliance between the Cords and the Ovians.
If we don't do something Todd, nobody cares.
Nobody cares, Todd.
Everything I did was to help you tell the story I knew you wanted to tell.
You got everything you wanted because of that book.
You were a joke, now people take you seriously.
You were out of work, now you got your dream role.
Okay, yes.
All of that is true.
But also, you were my friend and you hurt my feelings.
And it's weird that you never apologized for that and that you still won't.
Well I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
Are you? Yes, actually.
I am.
I didn't want to do that and I probably could have handled things better.
I definitely should have.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
But this is bigger than you and me.
And I need you in my corner now because I don't have anybody else.
Well, okay.
Yeah? Yeah.
I'm in your corner.
Guys, earlier, some general asked me if it was "a go" on "that thing we talked about"? And I said, "Yes.
" And he said, "God help us all" and left the room.
Now I'm not sure that was the right answer.
So, then I called Wayne to see if I could write a story for Buzzfeed.
Here's the good news: They'll publish anything.
Hey, um Can I talk to you? Yeah, of course.
What's up? I asked you, really nicely, not to make a big thing out of this.
Yeah, I know, but someone Had to say something, right? And that someone had to be you? Because why? I really don't get it.
What is accomplished by you being the one to take a stand on this? Uh Mr.
Peanutbutter This game show is a really big deal for me.
And I know that sounds stupid to you, and small.
But I need this to go well, and I can't Those are death threats.
People want to murder my wife because of what she's saying on the news about something that she has nothing to do with.
"You can't.
You stupid, ugly can't.
" Yeah, that doesn't say "can't.
" Oh.
God, you know, you'd almost be safer in Cordovia.
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.
I'm obviously not making a difference here.
Actually, maybe you should.
Go feel good about yourself and do your important work.
And maybe some space might be good for us.
You don't really want me to go, do you? Why does it suddenly matter what I want? Flight 57, Cordovian Airlines, now boarding.
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it? No, I did not.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Coming up, Kanye West claims to hate Thin Mints.
Our panel is outraged.
Hating Thin Mints? Is he legally insane? You can bet we'll get into this further in the next hour.
This is the only thing I care about now.
Hey.
Smile.
We're live in five minutes, folks.
Make way.
Someone find out the average rainfall in Bora Bora.
Thank you so much for doing this.
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.
It's more than being an elbow they couldn't crop out of a red-carpet shot in US Weekly.
I've been that elbow.
Hello, what have we here? So you know how the game's played, right? I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be? You didn't read the treatment? I faxed it to you.
My bad, our fax machine isn't plugged in.
BoJack, this is our first show and it is very important that things run smoothly tonight.
I mean, do you even care about this at all? Sweetie, no.
I think this is stupid and a waste of everybody's time.
But you're my girlfriend and I care about you.
So I'm here.
Okay.
Break a leg.
Me, me, me.
My, my, my.
Bow-wow-wow-wow.
Good boy, good boy.
Okay, this is it, everybody.
Moment of truth.
Now it's in the hands of god.
And for the next 30 minutes, I am that God.
I got you an iPad, ma'am.
Oh, no thanks, Mia.
I'm still working my way through the last 30 years of technology.
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.
But you can use our second screen app to see what viewers say about the show as it airs.
Oh, cool, I love stupid bullshit like this.
Ooh.
Oh, you just touch it.
Hello, I am Mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in my class from a prestigious university, rise through the ranks at an elite news organization, win a well-known award, never ever be sick at sea and also my name is Mia McKibben, so that I could deal with your nonsense.
Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.
But I like it there.
They brush my hair and tell me stories about their weekends.
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny, Zombie Todd wasn't funny, Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny, and this isn't funny.
No more tomfoolery.
When it's me, we call it "Todd-foolery.
" We certainly do not call it that.
Listen up, everyone.
What you are part of tonight is bigger than you.
It's bigger than any of us.
I expect all of you to work together.
But I also expect that one of you will tower above the rest.
And that outstanding individual will receive this pen.
It was through this pen that I bled Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters upon the page.
Also, it has four different colors.
Black, red, blue and for some reason, green.
By the end of tonight, this pen will be bestowed upon the person most deserving.
Because nothing is more important than television, and no one more important than the people who make that television.
Now, let's get to work.
And five, four, three, two Showtime.
Live from the historic Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, J.
D.
Salinger Presents: Hollywoo Stars And Celebrities, What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out! Ah.
All right! Here we go.
Listen to that crowd.
If they lose it this much for Mr.
Peanutbutter, can you imagine what they're going to do for a real celebrity? Hey, this is Mr.
Peanutbutter's show, so be nice.
When you say nice, do you mean kind? Or, like, delivering a lot of sick burns, so that people in the audience go, "Nice.
" The first one.
Obviously the first one.
Tonight we answer the age-old question: "Hollywoo stars and celebrities, what do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out!" And now our first-ever guest.
You know him from his years on Horsin' Around, his drunk appearance on The View, and his bestselling book, it's BoJack Horseman.
There you are.
How are you doing? BoJack, welcome.
It is great to be here.
Sorry, no time for idle chit-chat, because we've entered the Small Talk Round.
The what now? Thirty seconds on the clock.
BoJack, how are you? Uh, fine? Correct.
Did you see the game last night? No, I don't follow Oh.
Oh, so sorry.
It says here you did see the game.
What game? Ready camera one? Camera one.
You tell me.
You're the one who saw it.
I don't God, no! What the? That noise means it's time for your first General Knowledge question.
Audience, does BoJack know things? Let's find out! BoJack, what is the average annual rainfall in Bora Bora? Uh, this is general knowledge? It's just an average we're asking for.
I don't know, seven? Wrong! So wrong.
Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora, maybe this celebrity should have studied more-a more-a.
Yes, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Go for the kill.
That doesn't really seem They're all dead! I watched them die! What is? Oh-ho.
That sound means it's time to pick your category.
"Trigonometry.
" "Advanced Physics," and "At the Movies With Mr.
Peanutbutter.
" At the Movies With Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Good choice.
After seeing J.
J.
Abrams' Star Trek reboot, did I call it: A, "A visual feast for the senses," B, "A zestful lark through time and space," C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie of all time," or D, "All of the above"? I'll say D? Ouch, the answer was A and B.
Though I would also agree with C.
So I told Mr.
Peanutbutter I'd drive him here, and next thing I know, I'm an Associate Producer.
Stupid me.
I went to Stanford.
Next time I'll just try that thing where I'm a huge dumb-ass who happens to be friends with Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Yup.
Cool.
Well, have fun watching me win that pen.
I don't need a pen.
I can walk into any Chili's with a child under 12 and get crayons for free.
You don't get it.
If Salinger gives you his pen, that means you're worth something.
It means you're a serious person who's going places.
Actually, you know what? Don't worry about it.
It's not for you.
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.
Oh, the answer is Egypt.
Turn up the directional heat lamps.
Oh, yeah.
Let's really make him sweat.
Surprised you didn't get that one, since you're an expert when it comes to DE-Nile.
Quick impression.
"I'm not an alcoholic.
" You love it.
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt over here.
Am I right? You know, like King Tut? Because we're talking about Egypt? And Mr.
Peanutbutter's a mutt, so You suck.
I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.
You could get one thing right tonight.
Anyway, let's take a moment to look at the great comments we've been getting on our second screen app, now available for download.
And we're out.
Fifteen seconds, everybody.
Hey, how am I doing? You're kind of being a dick.
Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now? Because there's a lot of ribbing going on here.
I'm not ribbing you.
I'm telling you, you're And we're back in three, two Welcome back.
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show history as our worst contestant ever? So far, yes.
Wow.
J.
D.
, people are loving this show.
Wait till they see this.
Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.
Death from above! Uh-oh.
That sound means it's time to drop "DA" bomb.
And yes folks, I said "DA," not "the.
" What I'm trying to say is, it's a positive bomb.
Audience, let's Drop DA bomb! Did you guys all practice before the show, because Ladies and gentlemen, we've had some fun with our little celebrity.
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.
Big celebrity? Say hello to Daniel Radcliffe! Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe.
Hello.
Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe! We'll find out what our big celebrity knows right after this break.
And we're out.
Oh, we're cooking now.
Hey, you, you're doing great.
I'm not 100 percent watching because I'm so engrossed in the second screen experience, but according to the second screen experience, other people are loving the show.
You didn't tell me there would be another celebrity.
Well, I had no idea that was coming but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420 loved the surprise.
He said, "Two dongs way up.
" There was no mention of another bigger celebrity in the document you faxed? I couldn't read it.
My fax machine cut it into little strips.
That sounds like a shredder.
Well, I guess I shredded it to you.
I gotta deal with this.
If I don't interact with this app every 80 seconds, it charges my credit card five dollars.
Love you.
Ehh you, too.
Could you get the base a little less pale? Hey, Daniel, good to see you.
Always nice to meet a fan.
No, sorry, I'm not a, uh I'm an actor.
Oh, good for you.
It's a dreadful business but hang in there.
No, I already did hang in there.
I'm BoJack Horseman? We've actually met before.
At Chris Martin's holiday party? We stepped outside for a smoke? To get away from Chris Martin? Huh.
You opened up about your fear of success? I gave you some advice? You said I was a true friend and you would never forget me? And you said your name was Chadwick Boseman? BoJack Horseman.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When you're as famous as I am, you meet so many people.
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.
You were the second hairdresser's assistant on The Ellen Show about five years ago.
Veronica, right? Yeah, that's right.
How was your mother's party in the end? And we're back in five, four, three, two So you never say one, huh? Welcome back, America.
We love you, Daniel.
So do I.
So let's watch our celebrities go Audience? Head to head! How could they possibly know that? This is the first episode, right? The puppets clap when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.
Hello.
Serious, Going-Places Todd at your service.
Hey, look at you, all dressed up for the Dipshit Awards.
You know you're not allowed in Hair and Makeup.
Are you wearing roller skates? I'm wearing Heelys.
They're shoes with wheels, for efficiency purposes.
Now I can be serious faster.
You can also go nowhere faster.
Seeing as I am a professional No! Oh, BoJack.
Another embarrassingly wrong answer, bringing your score down by 80 points and 12 dollars.
Why are we playing for both points and dollars? Oh, tough break, B.
J.
Novak! My name is Our next question is to Mr.
Radcliffe.
"What color comes from the combination of blue and yellow?" I actually know this one.
When I was growing up, my neighbor was a painter.
I remember visiting his flat and watching him work.
Sometimes he would mix together blue paint with yellow paint and it made an entirely new color.
And that man was Banksy.
And that color was green.
Final answer.
Correct! You've earned the chance to go for a spin in our KIA Sportage Cash Grab Booth.
Oh, splendid.
And while Daniel's in the booth, BoJack, you have an essay question.
What? You'll find a blue book on your podium.
"To what extent was feudalism a cause of the French Revolution?" Wait, are you ser Oh! And go! While BoJack works, let's check out the action on our KIA Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.
Hey, champ.
What are you doing here? I'm trying to write an essay.
I came to ask you how you were doing and then to tell you you're not doing so well.
Why am I getting the hard questions, while Boy Wizard over there just has to know colors and literally grab cash out of thin air? A five! This is so easy! I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.
The year was 2003 and for some reason, everyone was playing poker all of a sudden.
A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama used to host a weekly how-do-you-do and all the stars came out to show off their tricks.
There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu, Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb, the dog from Frasier, and at the head of the table? Big Money himself, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Whoops.
Woh-oh.
I thought, "Here's a rube.
" But Lady Luck had other plans.
You know what, I got an essay to write, so if this isn't about the precipitous fall of the French ruling class But then I saw, the kid had a tell.
I feel like that story had a lot of unnecessary details in it.
Listen.
You have to pay close attention, it's subtle, but when he gets excited, his ears ever so slightly flop up and give him away.
Well, that's no surprise.
Guy's been flopping upwards his whole career.
Mm-hm.
Watch the ears.
Time's up, Daniel.
Whoa, looks like D to the R to the Ad to the Cliffe just won 54,000 bonus dollars.
And BoJack barely got beyond his thesis statement.
"A continent ravaged by war, coupled with the retreat of the church from secular life" And then it just stops? Oh, that's gonna cost you some serious pesos.
But first, it's time for our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.
A buzz-in round? All right.
In is my favorite direction in which to buzz.
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed to build an 18th century triple-Decker Royal Navy battle ship? A, 75? B, 1000? Or C, 3500?" C! 3500! Um, correct.
Uh, what? Uh, wow.
That's, uh That's actually correct.
How the hell did he know that? What else does he know? Does he know things? Let's find out.
Quantum tunneling.
King Magnus the Second.
Miss Scarlet in the library with the lead pipe.
Sassafras.
Butterscotch! Argyle.
Because seven eight nine.
What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.
Which is an exciting surprise.
Goddamn it, throw to commercial.
We'll be right back.
Hey.
Horshack.
What's going on? What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.
Yeah, you know, you're doing great, but I'm supposed to win.
That was the deal.
Plug my movie, win money for charity.
Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.
By the way, your girlfriend has a stripper name.
It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.
BoJack, according to this app, you're almost tied.
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
It was touch and go But I'm a little concerned because it seems like you might actually win, but everyone on the app is really rooting for Daniel.
People love him.
I guess he was in some movie about a potter or a Pottery Barn or something? Are you asking me to throw the game? You don't care about this game.
The only reason you're here is for me, so maybe you could help me out? Okay.
You know what? You're the best, no matter what everybody on this app says.
They say you're the worst.
Especially Queefburglar69.
He's their leader.
And we're back.
Contestants, I've got a history question for both of you.
"You may or may not be familiar with a famous racehorse named Secretariat.
In what year did Secretariat win the Triple Crown?" BoJack.
Piece of cake.
Hmm? Um, 1492? What? No, not even close.
BoJack, aren't you in a movie about Secretariat? How could you not know that? Let's just move on.
Maybe instead, he should be in a movie about a guy who doesn't know anything about Secretariat.
That would not be a good movie.
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.
Damn, Bojangles, you got served.
Do you know anything about Secretariat? You know he was a horse, right? Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you? No wonder my wife had to write your book for you.
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking about your wife, I've got a question.
How come your wife flew all the way to war-torn Cordovia just to get away from you? That's not what happened.
She went to help people.
Or maybe she went to help herself get away from her awful marriage.
Oh, was that too far? Oh-ho, you want to get into things? Well, I mean No, no, no, let's get into things.
Let's get real.
Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.
Cancel the Bubble Round.
Because we're getting real.
Should we cut to commercial? Would Homer cut away from Odysseus's journey just as he was being enticed by the sirens' song? No? Well, there you are.
Things are getting real out here.
Really real.
Really, really, really real! Uh, I'm not sure where you're going Oh, no? You knew where you were going with my wife that time you pulled over by the side of the road.
You know, a week before we got married? Uh You want to talk about that, BoJack? You want to talk about the time when you, my "good friend," kissed my wife? No! Yes.
Did something exciting just happen? Because people on the app are, and I quote, "losing their tits.
" Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to a cancer support message board.
Okay, how do I? How did you know about that? Well, there are roadside cameras all along the PCH, I have a few friends in the highway patrol, and she told me, of course! We're married! Wait, so you've known all this time? Now this is television.
Turn on the rain.
Um, don't you think you're pushing them too far? I'll tell you when it's too far.
This is my art, goddamn it.
I'm J.
goddamn D.
goddamn Salinger, and I want rain! All I ever wanted was to be your friend.
And you treat me like a big joke.
You think I don't notice? Why don't you like me? Mr.
Peanutbutter No, tell me.
Because I'm jealous.
Oh.
Of what? Diane? No.
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.
Oh, and it doesn't for you? You're a millionaire movie star with a girlfriend who loves you, acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want? What else could the universe possibly owe you? I want to feel good about myself.
The way you do.
And I don't know how.
I don't know if I can.
Whoa, guys, this is getting a little heavy, don't we think? I'm sorry, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Wow, um, I don't know if I can forgive you.
But I guess we'll find out right after this break.
Damn.
Shut up.
I knew it.
I knew this show would bring us to the heights of human drama more powerfully than literature ever dreamed.
Now somebody go out and get me a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.
On it.
It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.
Whoa-oh! Mr.
Peanutbutter! Oh, hey Wanda.
I'm only half paying attention to whatever you two are arguing about but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.
I don't think we can just resolve everything cleanly in a half-hour.
Uh, this is network television.
So resolving everything cleanly in a half-hour is kind of what we do.
You want to host a game show where everyone feels bad at the end? You can get in your little car, drive to Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.
But these people want resolution, okay? So you get your little butt back on that stage and you resolve.
Uh And we're back.
You know, I did some thinking over the break.
BoJack What's going on? Oh, my God.
No! No! What's happening? Oh.
Someone unplugged the main power line and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.
Panini time.
Hey, who unplugged Todd! Goddamnit, step aside! Mia, good work.
You saved the show.
You earned my respect and this pen.
Oh, thank you.
Aww.
Oh, are we back? We're back! Live television, folks.
You know, during the break, my producers told me I had to forgive BoJack live on the air.
But I'm my own dog.
And as my own dog, I decided to forgive BoJack live on the air! Bring it in, buddy! What? Really? Mr.
Peanutbutter, I applaud your forgiving nature, but this guy kissed your wife.
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane? The only way to even the score is if you get to kiss him.
Wait, what? You're right, it makes perfect sense.
Yeah, absolutely.
No, it doesn't.
That way Diane and I will have had the same experience.
It's the only way we can move past this.
Well, if it helps us move past this, I guess Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Cue the Kiss Cam.
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam for Catcher In The Rye.
Well, just one more regret on a long list of many.
Todd, there you are.
You're missing a pretty big moment out there.
I don't care.
You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.
Not for nothing, but you were worthless before you didn't get the pen.
I really tried this time.
I guess I'll never really amount to anything.
Well, maybe you just need someone to believe in you.
Wow, no one's ever fallen for that! What? You're so stupid! You had the pen and you just gave it to me?! Oh, I can't believe that worked.
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.
The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't Yeah, said the girl who doesn't have a pen right now.
Unbelievable.
You are the most annoying, immature, aggravating, irritating, crazy-making Oh, she was mad, all right.
But kids? That's the story of how I met this pen.
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup and give me back my pen! I got your pen.
That means you respect me.
No it does not.
Viva Todd-foolery! Suck a dick, dumbshits.
Hey! Hey, hey! Well, that stern but supple kiss puts you over the top.
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.
Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.
You've earned $500,000 for charity.
You can walk away right now or, and remember, this is for charity, you can risk it all in our Double or Nothing round.
I wanna risk it all! All right.
Now that's $500,000.
If you get this question right, you double that, a million dollars for charity.
But if you get it wrong, the charity gets nothing and all the money will be set on fire live here on our studio soundstage.
BoJack, for all the marbles: "Which famous actor played the titular role in the popular Harry Potter film franchise?" Oh.
Huh.
Yeah.
I don't know.
When you're as famous as I am, you meet so many people, it's impossible to remember them all.
Okay, I get what you're doing.
Very funny.
Yeah.
Oh, what is that guy's name? You know, it's on the tip of my tongue? Are you serious right now? Dude, this is for charity.
BoJack, we need an answer.
Yeah, I don't know.
Gosh, I wanna say Elijah Wood? What? Elijah Wood?!
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.
I can do whatever I want.
I'm president of the goddamn United States of America.
Isn't that right, Checkers? That's what it says on your business cards.
There are going to be riots in the streets.
I'm Secretariat.
You think I'm afraid of a few rioting hippies? Don't make me laugh.
Ha-hoo.
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.
Please, I'll do anything.
You gotta send someone else in my place.
Hmm.
Perhaps an arrangement can be arranged.
I'm just an athlete.
I'm no hero.
My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.
He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam, which is necessary to protect our way of life.
And another hero is President Nixon.
He is one groovy dude.
Groovy.
What the hell are you doing? Sorry, Mommy! Don't you dare put that out.
That is a perfectly good cigarette, and you are going to finish it.
But I don't wanna.
And I don't want to be the mother of a quitter.
Finish it.
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke a cigarette right.
Don't you dare cry, don't you ever cry.
You wanted this.
Are you punishing me for smoking or for stealing? I'm punishing you for being alive.
Ugh.
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw a lit cigarette off the Fine.
I'll call 911.
The fire department got everything under control, but the cable's out for the neighborhood.
I don't understand what started the fire.
Nobody knows where fires come from, it's a mystery.
Anyway, I am fired up about my first day back on set.
We're gonna finish that big Nixon scene.
We were just one shot away before we went on hiatus.
Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.
Why did you call me? Usually I talk to Diane on the way to work, but she abandoned me to teach piano in Cordovia or something.
Oh.
Well, glad you settled for me because Diane wasn't available.
You bet.
Oh, man, I'm gonna kill in this Nixon scene.
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.
In da White House.
What happened to da house set? Da White House set? Things changed a little.
You cut the Nixon scene? The Nixon scene is the core of the whole movie.
Where we see Secretariat be morally corrupted and get to look into the real darkness of his soul.
It's still all that, except now it happens while you give a Christmas present to your nieces and they hug you while your butt is stuck in a chimney.
Is one of the nieces Nixon? Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.
People don't want all that controversial stuff.
But we were supposed to make a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.
Warts and all.
Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.
That's why they took the gay stuff out of A Beautiful Mind.
Know that guy who spent 12 years as a slave? They don't talk about the 60 years he spent as a jerk.
Kelsey, you're okay with this? Eh That's showbiz.
See, BoJack, that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.
Good shrugging, kid.
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.
We'll meet in the supply closet in one minute.
Break! Oh, okay.
Ooh, ow.
Carolyn, when you're in the throes of a very ugly divorce such as I am, along with all that pain and degradation comes a certain perfect clarity, and right now that clarity is telling me that you and I should get out of here.
Well, what do you mean, "get out of here"? Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency, and I want you to be my partner in crime.
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.
I've been here 20 years.
Who's gonna water the plants? Um, I'm sorry.
You water the plants? I started doing it as an intern, but then no one told me to stop, so it's still kind of my job.
Carolyn, you are my gritty, witty city kitty.
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.
Things are so crazy for me right now.
I Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song and your second favorite Gnarls Barkley song.
I don't want crazy.
I've got five episodes of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR, and I just want a night off to enjoy them.
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.
Gekko?! But I'd rather look at you all day.
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.
And I think we could make something really special.
We weren't doing anything! We were just looking for closet supplies.
Are you the person to talk to about unclogging the toilet? Stuart, I'm your boss.
Okay, but you're the one in the janitor's closet, so What, I'm the idiot? The first thing you notice about Sebastian St.
Clair is that he speaks in paragraphs.
Even I can't believe how much good we've done here, and I'll believe almost anything.
In the last six weeks, we dug a new well, built a school, and next month the community center is doing Seussical.
There we go.
In his previous life, Sebastian owned a chain of high-end department stores.
I want to stock up on muffs.
We're going to sell a lot of muffs this winter.
Huzzah! Diane, I lived a life of power and luxury, and then my picture was in the newspaper.
A real-life newspaper! Uh-huh.
But I knew my life was empty.
At night I heard the cries of children sick and dying.
And I would scream into the night.
Shut up! Shut up, children! But the phantom cries would not abate.
And so I began my travels, with little more than a compass, a yearning for adventure, and several crates full of unsold muffs.
I knew there were people out there just waiting for my help.
Diane, this is Kinko.
I am Kinko.
In his language, it means, orphan whose parents were murdered by rebels and will die young, probably from malaria.
Hi, Kinko.
I'm Diane.
It means, my parents liked the show Cheers.
Cheers! Oh, you're good.
You're very good.
When Sebastian St.
Clair says you're good, you want to believe that you really are.
That you, like Sebastian, are part of something bigger than just yourself.
And for a moment, you feel like you are.
Oh, Kinko made a mess.
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is way more valuable than a Triple Crown.
And cut.
Neat.
Let's break for lunch.
Oh! Kelsey, this is a nightmare.
I had to touch three children today, and one of them was sticky.
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.
BoJack, there's nothing we can do.
No, this isn't you.
I've seen everything you've done.
Your films are challenging and gritty, and they're great.
I'm not just saying that because they're full of lesbians.
Look, even if I wanted to finish that Nixon scene, we don't have an Oval Office set.
There's one at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda.
Why on earth do you know that? In season three of Horsin' Around, the horse got elected president and we shot on location.
We can sneak into the library and get the shot, guerilla-style.
Once Turteltaub sees it, he'll love it, and we can make the movie we both want to make.
Okay, I'm in.
Let's do it.
All right! Did they really make your character president? Only for season three.
In season four, it turned out it was all a dream.
They called my airplane Air Horse One.
And the vice president was a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.
Come on.
It wasn't our best season.
But on the bright side, was not our worst.
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library and steal the scale model.
Welcome to my library.
I'm Nixon.
.
Yeah, you know, some people say I look like Nixon.
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy.
Nixon's not my dad.
But if you have any questions about Nixon, I'd be happy to answer them.
Yeah, I have a question.
Um Is that the lighted exit sign from Nixon's boyhood home? Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.
Is that Here we go.
the handicapped drinking fountain he used in the White House? No, just a normal drinking fountain.
Hang on.
One more.
Is that the smoke alarm? No.
So the Oval Office is right here, next to the men's room.
I remember because season three of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.
All the pressures of being president.
I don't see how we'll pull this off.
We're gonna need a crack team.
First, we gotta get the best lock-pick in the city.
Not interested.
Okay.
The second best lock-pick in the city.
No way I'm doing that.
Got it.
A lock-pick.
Todd, can you pick locks? Kind of.
Great.
You're in.
We'll need an expert cat burglar.
All right, Good Wife, let's see what you got.
Hey, Princess Carolyn! Kelsey and I are gonna break into the Nixon library to steal a shot for our Secretariat movie.
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper that stands to benefit you in no way.
Are you in? Hey! Shut up down there! You shut up! Make me! Hey, you got a problem? Take it up with my agent, your downstairs neighbor Princess Carolyn.
We'll need someone to play Checkers.
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight.
Da Bears.
BoJack, I'd love to help you out, but I'm super-busy recording promos for television's highest-rated new game show.
We can probably do it without you.
This next one's for Seattle.
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight.
Rain.
It's too bad though because I could really bring a lot to this project.
The more I think about it, Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.
It's just a single on Secretariat.
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight.
So sorry.
You know what? Forget I even asked.
Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
Okay.
Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.
Character actress Margo Martindale, you've been a model prisoner.
I'm glad I served my time.
But now I'm ready to move on with my life and get back to doing small roles in critically-acclaimed films and television shows.
Watch, purse, lipstick, Emmy Award for Best Guest Actress.
I need your help with a break-in.
BoJack, I've been out of prison for two minutes.
What took you so long? Kelsey, Mr.
Peanutbutter and I are gonna break into the library.
But the problem is, the place is crawling with cops.
They're on high alert because some idiot stole this model last night.
Yeah, nice work, Todd.
Who am I kidding? I can't stay mad at you.
You're adorable.
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them! Totally.
Now, we need to lose the cops.
The rest of you will create a diversion by breaking into the only other place in Yorba Linda of cultural significance: the Discount Fine Art Gallery in the strip mall, between the tanning salon and the adult bookstore.
Once you set off the alarm, all the cops will go there.
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.
Possibly Alan.
Why possibly Alan? Well, you are the guy none of us knows that well.
I just came to fix your cable.
Alan, you already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.
But Hey, you think you could keep it down? I'm reading a script and I'm having trouble focusing, so now my notes are gonna be confusing and vague.
We're almost done.
I know you're having fun with your police cars, I just wish you would have asked before you invited these people over.
I live here, too.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
And can you at least let Alan fix the cable before he dies? I can't die.
I'm endangered! "And the truffle-infused gnocchi was the star dish at this up-and-comer that will please the pickiest of Brooklynites and the less discerning Staten Islander.
" When I grow up, I can be food critic for New Yorker? You can do anything you want in life.
Not everyone can write for The New Yorker, but there's always The Atlantic.
Diane, I'm concerned you're spending a lot of time with this sickly child.
Remember, you're supposed to be writing about me.
Sure, but isn't this why we're here? To help these people? I'm here to help these people.
You're here to help me help them by writing a book about me so people back home will give money to my foundation.
Great.
Okay, come on.
Over here.
Get it.
We're in.
It's too late to turn back now.
One of us isn't going to come out of this alive.
Why do you all keep saying that? Why can't we all assume we're gonna make it out alive and go from there? Alan, we've got enough problems without worrying about your imminent death.
Can't we just all shut up and do this? Why does everything have to be a big, complicated mess? Like, look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.
It's simple.
And serene.
And pleasant.
I think that the vest makes me look kind of chunky.
I don't do CrossFit five days a week to not look sweet in this uniform.
I swear to God, if you don't shut up about CrossFit Break-in at the Discount Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.
Let's roll! That's a thing we say at CrossFit.
Remember when my character on Mr.
Peanutbutter's House was elected president? Let me guess, it was all a dream? No, I served half a term, then resigned because when Zachary had a bad time with peer pressure, I realized I was spending too much time being president and not enough time being a dad.
It's like you didn't even watch my show.
Okay, I'd like you here.
And then you are going to be over here.
Freeze! I'm union.
Playing dead.
Breaking and entering? That is against everything Nixon stood for.
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.
Yeah? What, another leftist screed about how corrupt he was? Uh Or is it about how he had an illegitimate son, and the son never knew who his dad was, but always had a hunch it was Nixon, and then that son grew up to be the security guard at the Nixon Library? The second one? Well, if that's true, how come you don't have an actor here to play Nixon? Because we couldn't find anyone who could appropriately capture his magic.
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.
You? No way.
Hello, I'm Nixon.
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am your father and I love you very much.
Oh, my God.
He's perfect.
We've found our Nixon.
I can be ready in five.
Uh.
Did we get the shot? It's so peaceful.
Okay, folks.
Aah! Party's over.
That's something we say at CrossFit.
Ugh.
Wait a sec I know you! You were in Justified.
You were amazing.
Okay, you caught me.
I am kind of a well-known character actress.
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh What? What's your name? Sure, of course.
Everyone loves my work, but apparently not enough to watch the credits and find out what my name is.
The important thing is that we enjoy your great performances, right? How about you enjoy this? Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.
Oh, is that what we agreed to? I thought we said "no gum.
" But you're also chewing gum.
I'm a wild card.
Aah! Return fire! Watch out! Oh, no! Alan's dead! No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead! Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad! See you later! Die, you chunky assholes! See, Jeff? This is what I'm talking about.
Shoot! Oh.
How could this be any more perfect? Yoo-hoo.
Vanessa Gekko.
How did you get in this painting? I'm your servant, of course.
In your infinite generosity, you gave me this job when it became clear that I don't have what it takes to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.
Also, my husband left me.
And my children married each other in an unholy incestuous union.
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.
How appropriate! Fetch me drink, wench.
Right away, ma'am.
Ah.
Diane The second thing you notice about Sebastian St.
Clair is how much he talks about himself.
This way is the library I built.
And over there is the statue of me building the library.
And on that wall is a painting of me posing for the statue.
Put a chapter in your book about that.
Uh-huh.
The only respite from his constant bombast is sleep, and even then, sometimes Everybody Those of you who can walk, I mean.
let's drag these corpses to the mass grave behind the playground.
We need to make room for my new hospital.
Where's Kinko? Is he okay? Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.
See, Diane, I told you not to make friends.
Jesus, you don't care about any of these people.
You're just using them as props for your big-shot superhero act.
Diane, the dead will not benefit from our grief, but the survivors need a new hospital and we need to build it.
This is too much.
If you're going to survive, you'll need to harden up.
I asked you to join me because I thought you could handle it.
But if you can't, you can go home.
I I can handle it.
Great! Let's drag some bodies! Kinko! Oh, never mind.
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line and I don't get a line? We only gave him a line so he wouldn't call the police.
If I call the police, will I get a line? No, we won't use it in the movie.
We only need the one-shot of me.
I just think if he gets a line, I should get a line.
Ugh.
Actors.
Okay, positions everyone.
And action.
I'm Nixon.
The way you're feeling about your dead brother is how I feel about the son I'll never know.
But I look at the moon and so does he.
That's how I know we're connected.
And I'm Checkers.
All right, so, BoJack, you've been told that your brother, Jeffretariat, the one Nixon sent to Vietnam in your place, is dead.
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.
And the tears start to flow.
And the tears start to flow.
Oh.
I don't cry in front of other people.
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front of other people.
I can't.
Really, never? Come on.
What if someone tells you they'll take you to the park, and they keep talking about the park and all the fun you'll have, but then But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.
Can you give us the room, please? There's a park right outside we can hang out at.
Oh! Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.
Ah.
Well, another beautiful, serene day in magical fantasy-painting world.
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may, I have some exciting news.
I just landed a new client.
The mill owner! Huh? We're doing a three-picture deal about his waterwheel.
Wait, you're making deals here? I'll say.
I'm now the biggest agent in the entire idyllic New England village.
It's like you don't even read the idyllic New England village trades.
What? No! You're polluting my perfect serene dream life.
Why is this happening? I don't know.
It's your fantasy.
But if you ask me, I don't think you want perfect and serene and enough time to catch up on The Good Wife.
Stop kidding yourself, Princess Carolyn.
If you really wanted the simple life, you'd have a simple life.
Oh, my God.
I gotta get out of here.
Bye! Hey.
Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.
Get your demo guys together.
Let's tear this old Tudor down and put up some condos! Okay.
This isn't just for me.
It's for John Carroll Lynch, C.
C.
H.
Pounder, and all the other character actors who live in lucrative obscurity.
The blood I spill today is for us all! I'm character actress Margo Martindale! Yeah, I'm going to go with Princess Carolyn.
Hmm.
Hello? Hey.
There you are! I've been trying to call you all week.
Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is Diane, Diane.
Listen, I gotta tell you: I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about your trip.
The truth is, I really am so proud of you.
A lot of people talk big, but you're actually out there helping people.
You're the real deal, Diane.
Yeah How is it there? Is it amazing? It's good.
It's hard, but it's good.
I miss you.
I miss you, too, but I promise, these six months are gonna fly by.
Yeah.
How's the game show going? Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed to be hosting a game show right now.
I gotta go.
And that's when you realize that the book you've been writing in your head is never actually going to be a book, so you stop I know what you're gonna say.
I'm a dumb sitcom actor who's in over his head.
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.
And I'm sorry I made you come here.
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.
BoJack, sit down.
You've just been told your brother is dead and that it's your fault.
But this moment is bigger than that.
This is the moment that Secretariat stops running.
Because this is the moment you realize something inside you is broken, and it can never be fixed.
We got it.
Really? I didn't cry.
You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.
Oh.
All right.
Thanks for talking me into this.
Just so you know, I'm really glad we're making this movie together.
Didn't know I had it in me, did you? No, I knew.
Huh.
Hold the elevator, please.
Coming in? I'm all in.
Whoa! Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's Uncle Secretariat? He had to go win a race against the Russians.
But maybe, if he runs really fast Hey, where's Kelsey? Oh, yeah, funny story.
Turns out you two knuckleheads snuck out last night and got that shot I told you not to get for the scene that's not in the movie anymore.
Uh Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.
What? We got a movie to finish, okay? So, go get in costume, get your butt up that chimney, and do your thing, Hamlet.
Just maybe, all we have to do is believe! What are you doing here? Hey, is it cool if I crash here for a couple nights? I didn't know where else to go.
Aw, she looks so peaceful.
Think she's dreaming that she's not overstaying her welcome? When she got that wine delivered to the house, I thought that was her thank-you present, that she was leaving, but then she just drank the wine.
Five days ago.
Morning, everybody.
Aah! Kinko! Another beautiful day in the city of Brotherly Angels.
Todd, I don't recall accidentally ingesting poison, and yet here you are trying to make me vomit.
You wanna go buy me a kite and then fly a kite? No.
Kites are sky trash.
Why is it so daytime right now? Wanda? Wanna go surf some cloud waves? That's what I call wind.
Sorry.
Some of us have jobs.
Not all of us.
Just some of us.
Oh, yeah, my job.
Morning.
What? I'm done with my sabbatical and I'm ready to get back to work.
What sabbatical? I fired you.
Oh, I thought when you said, "You're fired," that was just you "giving me the business.
" No, I was taking the "business" away from you.
Oh.
Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite? Put me down for a supersized "sounds great.
" But with an even larger main course of "sadly, I cannot.
" I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.
Then we record the show.
And then I gotta take my suit off.
So, that's, like, the whole day.
Sorry.
Ah.
"Looking for a friend?" Yes.
"Need direction?" I'm listening.
"Try Scientology"? Huh.
Excuse me? Sir? Huh? Have you ever thought about trying improv comedy? Improv comedy? I don't know Why not? It's not like there's anything else to do.
Here on Mars.
We're on Mars? Yes.
And in a Martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl? Whoa! The only limit is my imagination.
Why not come by our theater and try a free class? Okay! Can I bring this food inside the theater? Ha, good one.
But no.
Oh.
"That's when I learned that guns can blow a vato away.
But calculus? Calculus can blow a mind away.
" Cut! We got it! That's the day, everybody.
You sure we got it, Abe? Of course.
You were phenomenal.
Really? Because that kid sneezed in the middle of my monologue.
We can fix that in post.
Abe, I'm supposed to tell you the boom mike fell into the last shot.
You sure you don't wanna get another take? Just for safety? What am I, Kubrick? We can fix all this stuff in post.
It's an easy scene.
Secretariat's a nice guy, the Spanish kids learn a lesson.
Boom.
Bam! Done! But Secretariat never actually taught math in South Central.
I don't know what Secretariat did or didn't do.
I wasn't there.
Yeah, but Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers, we'll give them gangbangers.
We get paid either way, right? I guess.
I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.
You like coq au vin? I think so.
Is that the move where a French girl pours soup in Come over for dinner, okay? You'll love it.
Okay.
Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making Casablanca.
BoJack.
Shut up.
Aah! What are you? No one can know I'm here.
What? Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.
As you know, you're my favorite client.
If I left Vigor, would you follow me to a new agency? Sure, but no one's gonna hire me after this movie comes out.
The script turned into a piece of shit, and the director is a total hack.
Good guy, total hack.
Let's get you something before the movie comes out.
We got an offer in for this new play off-Broadway.
Theater? That's what real actors do.
Yeah, I told them that, but they said she wanted you.
She? Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.
She came out of nowhere.
Jill Pill? New York Magazine called her the enfant terrible of the immersive theater world, and then later clarified that that's a compliment.
It sounds like the kind of thing I should be doing now.
Something artistic and bold.
Rehearsals start in two weeks.
Are you ready to go to New York for six months? New York's a great city to live in for six months and not a second longer and only if you're insanely wealthy.
I can't wait! Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.
Apple sauce! Oh-ho! That was so funny.
Which one of you guys wrote all those funny jokes? No, Todd, here at Shenanigags, we make things up on the spot.
Let's try it.
Give me a suggestion.
Uh I don't know.
Suggestions? Your suggestion was "suggestions.
" Way to break the fourth wall.
That wasn't that funny.
My name's Bryan and you haven't won me over yet.
Oh, Bryan.
Todd, in improv, we get suggestions from an audience then make up scenes based on them.
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions.
You don't say no.
No matter what.
When someone makes a suggestion, you always try to build on it.
We call that "yes, and" Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.
Is it really that simple? Ugh! It's incredibly complicated and requires years of training.
Oh, Bryan.
But improv isn't just about a constant clamoring for attention and validation.
It's about community.
I've always wanted to be part of a community.
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.
I thought you said it was free.
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.
I am so proud of you.
Every day I'm telling people all about the great stuff you're doing there.
Yeah, I don't know And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing.
" And I say, "I'm here to confirm she is an incredible woman.
" Well You know, the sound guy's wife works with at-risk teens.
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay, but compared to what my wife is doing, your wife is bullshit!" Oh.
And he had to agree with me.
Um Because I am his boss.
Listen Let me talk to one of the locals.
I wanna hear someone else talk about how what a selfless hero my wife is.
Oh, uh Ah, now come on.
Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
Find one with a tongue.
I don't think Indulge me.
Okay.
Hello.
I am refugee from village.
Hey, what's your name, Superstar? Uh, my name is Coffee Maker.
Ah.
Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right? Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs in class today.
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene was so innovative.
Eh Oh, Bryan.
Guys, look.
It's Copernicus.
Who's that? What are you, new? Yes, I am new.
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner of modern improv.
Who is Jan-Ove Waldner? The Michael Jordan of table tennis.
Oh.
Let's go talk to him.
Are you kidding? You can't just go up and talk to Copernicus.
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.
No, I'm not.
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.
Freestyle.
No audience, no net.
I don't know Hey, if you're down with the prov, you gotta prove that prov.
All right.
I'll do it.
Hello, old ma'am.
Oh, hello.
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her? Yes, and she exploded? Doris exploded? You just got prov'd! In your face, lady! The streets are ours! Hurray, improv! I did it! You have briefly won me over.
Poor Doris That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse, but we do get by.
Oh, stop.
Bam! Like Emeril? Ha, remember that? He said "bam.
" I don't know who Emeril is, but he sounds delightful.
Hey, should I give him a sitcom? BoJack, Abe tells me you guys are almost done with the movie.
One week left! You two lovebirds gonna do any traveling or anything? I'll be traveling back and forth to New York for the next few months because BoJack's doing a play there after you finish.
Oh, I love plays.
A play.
That's my favorite place to eat crinkly candies.
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work on something good, you know? Oh? Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot, even though the movie's gonna be a piece of shit, right? What? Oh, you said "piece of ship," right? Like shipshape? Anyway, what were we talking about? Who knows? Okay, moving on.
Hey, it's fine.
Abe knows what we're making.
Right? Wanda, would you help me with dessert? Uh, okay.
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer, but I don't think we're going to be done in time.
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.
Are you kidding? Well, you know, because the movie's such a piece of shit and all.
Did that hurt your feelings? I mean, you're the one who said we're not making Casablanca.
Right, because Casablanca is a movie about a club owner named Rick.
This movie's about Secretariat, a racehorse.
Wait, you literally meant we're not making the actual movie Casablanca? That movie already exists.
Why would we make Casablanca? This is a different movie.
I think there was a misunderstanding.
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.
And that mister is me understanding you just fine.
You come into my home and you call my work shit? You know what I think? You're shit.
What? You think I don't get enough takes? I'll get more takes.
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.
Because it's a different kind of pie? That's right.
Why did you have to antagonize him? I wasn't trying to antagonize him.
He said, "It's no Casablanca.
" Well, what's done is done.
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.
Lucky me, I get to stay here and work on this movie that's gonna ruin my career.
There's no reason to sulk about it, right? Or you could sulk about it.
Diane does raise some good points.
No, she doesn't.
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person you wanna be going to for life advice now.
Why? Just because I've been drinking myself to sleep on your deck chairs and lying to my husband for the last week? Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.
I knew I kept these things around for a reason.
I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
No one cares, Todd.
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice? Make a suggestion.
Stop.
Aah.
Sorry, officer, I didn't see that stop sign.
Yes.
And my car runs on farts.
Ugh! Stop.
No, stop it.
Please stop.
Not a suggestion.
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.
I want to become a Level Two, so I can finally achieve clarity on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.
What? No, improv is not a cult.
It's just a dogmatic school of thought taught by a for-profit organization with the promise of social and professional opportunities.
Ahh.
It's a cult.
And I know.
I learned a little about cults during that year I was a Scientologist.
Coincidentally during that year, I read a book about cults.
Wait, are you saying Scientology is a cult? No, Scientology is not a cult.
Improv is a cult.
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.
I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
Why does anything matter, right? Love is an illusion, and happiness is fleeting, no such thing as God, and all your favorite musicians beat their wives.
Allegedly.
Would you talk to her? Yes.
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.
Heyyy Hitler.
Please stop.
President Lohan! Get away from that fire hose! Fire hose! Sorry I'm late, guys! Todd, we take tardiness seriously here at Shenanigags.
If you miss one more class, you're out.
I'm sorry.
But, wait, Bryan isn't here.
He's later than I am.
Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought he could benefit from some time away.
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.
Is that a reward or a punishment? That's up to Bryan.
Let's have no more questions about the Giggleship.
Oh, uh, all right.
Well, you know, I was actually talking to my best friend, and he said improv is a cult.
I mean, that's crazy, right? If you think Shenanigags is a cult, you're free to go, Todd.
Oh, no.
I don't wanna go.
I love this place.
My friend just doesn't know how great you guys are.
It sounds like your friend's not yes-and'ing you.
Invite him to your graduation show.
If he's too negative to support you, you should take a good hard think about if that's the kind of energy you want in your life.
I hate good hard thinks.
I love you, too, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
But I I gotta go.
I'm Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.
The kids get jealous if I'm talking on the phone.
Uh, okay, bye.
So, hey, hi.
How long are you thinking of staying here? Just for my own reference.
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me? No one is making me do anything.
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.
Well, yeah.
I really thought I could do it.
I thought I could go far away and help people and be this best possible version of myself.
And what happened? I couldn't.
I wasn't the person I thought I was.
I'd love to stay and wallow with you, but I gotta head out.
Today we're filming what used to be the scene where Secretariat commits suicide, but is now a scene where he swims in a fishing hole with his girlfriend "Susie Side.
" Yeesh.
If you wanna blow off work, I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch, drink beer, and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around.
Hmm.
And if I hear one more peep out of you Sabrina! What? I didn't peep! Oh! Sabrina was such a little bitch.
She was an orphan.
She had a tough life.
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.
Did you go to work today? I was gonna, but then I remembered everything is garbage, so why bother doing anything? True story.
Okay.
Oh, you didn't.
Oh, you did.
Hello.
Hey, could you get the door? Whoa.
Mm.
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months to get everything we need out of this place.
Mm.
Perfect.
Just so you know, I had to register the corporation in your name.
What? Just until the divorce is finalized.
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely right now.
They're hawks.
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.
Rutabaga, this is too This is a temporary technicality, I promise.
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay? Mm.
Mm.
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there, so I just Ooh.
Oh, hello.
Look at this urn.
What's going on in here? Mr.
Peanutbutter, shut the door.
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency, and we want you to come with us.
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.
Are you in or out? Are you kidding? You're the agent who got me Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.
Well What do they know? Right, so Do they know things? Okay Let's find out.
Right Big fan.
I like you guys.
I like your hustle and I like your matching lipstick.
Well, um I am in.
Mm-hm.
Go home, Goober.
Yeah! Go home, Goober! Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home? Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.
You suck, Goober! Hey, Goober! Get murdered! Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.
Hey, guys.
Shut up, Todd.
BoJack, listen, I Oh! Hey, whoa! Boo! Party foul! You knocked over Bucking-can Palace.
Come on! Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later.
" Hasn't picked up his shit in years.
Clean up your shit, Todd.
BoJack, I wanted to invite you to my graduation show tomorrow night.
What? Look, I know you think it's just a dumb cult, but you're my best friend and it would really mean a lot if you came.
I'm gonna go down to the basement to practice my space work.
And here I am going downstairs.
Hello? What kind of pants are you wearing now? What? I don't know.
The normal kind.
Yeah? Mm.
Are they comfy? A comfy pair of pants? I guess.
Why? Just wondering what kind of hit you're gonna take when the studio sues the pants off you for breach of contract.
They're suing me? Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes? Because that was a long road to walk to get to that punch line.
This is serious.
We're not just doing bits? You started it with the pants thing.
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.
Remember, you wanted this.
Are you saying you're finally ready to settle down with yours truly? Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse, but I'm tired of running in circles.
Cut! Perfect.
But let's get that last part again.
Anything you want me to do differently? No, I just think we should get it again.
You know, for safety.
Action! I'm tired of running in circles.
And again? I'm tired of running in circles.
Why don't we get it like five more times? I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
Let's get it ten more times.
Ta-da! We did it.
What now? We die, have our guts ripped out through our noses, and get enshrined inside of it.
Duh.
Hey, BoJack, can I talk to you for a minute? Ooh Alone, please? Oh So, good news.
We're gonna go on a trip.
Right now.
You and me.
What? I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.
Where? Why? Less asking, more basking.
In the sun, that is.
Santa Barbara.
I'm not really in the mood for I think some time away could be really good for us, as a couple.
Oh.
I know you've been really bummed out about the movie, but I don't think moping around the house with Diane all day is healthy.
All I've ever wanted was to be in this movie, and you just want me to put on a happy face Yes.
There are lots of people who don't like their jobs.
Doesn't mean they have to bring it home with Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
What is that supposed to mean? Well, come on.
You're a network executive.
You don't give a shit about work.
I actually have a lot of pride in what I do.
What? You have a lot of pride? Your job is to pump out garbage every year hoping some of the garbage stinks less than the rest so you can quietly renew that garbage and keep failing sideways until you retire to a three-point-five bedroom garbage in Beverly Garbage and spend the rest of your life watching your former assistant's garbage.
I don't know where this is coming from.
Every good thing that ever happened to you happened because of network executives like me.
That show you spend all day watching, your house, your career Great house, great career, great life! Must be why I'm so happy all the time! You don't know I don't? My life was ruined by a network executive like you.
Well, I'm sorry that things have been so hard for you, but that doesn't give you the right to be shitty to me.
I can't be around someone who's just fueled by bitterness and negativity.
Well then, what are you doing here? What happened, BoJack? Same thing that always happens.
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.
And now you know me.
You know, it's funny.
When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.
So, Wanda's moving out.
Oh, shit.
Because of me? No.
Because of me.
I'm sorry.
You wanna watch another episode of Horsin' Around? Where Olivia does the school project where she pretends an egg is a baby.
Spoiler alert: Ethan needs to make an omelet.
Why won't you go home? I should.
I know I should.
I wish I could just go home right now and crawl into bed and not have to talk about anything or explain anything.
He would just say, "How was your day?" And then he would say, "Hey, did you know the monorail was invented by George Monorail?" And I would say, "I don't think that's true.
" And he would say, "Well, if he didn't invent it, he certainly perfected it.
" And I wouldn't have to say, "I'm sorry I left.
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.
I'm sorry I'm not the person I thought I was.
" I would just say, "My day was good.
" And he would say, "I love you.
" The longer you keep lying to him, the harder it's gonna get.
Can I ask you something? That play in New York, would that really have made you happy? Yeah.
I mean, for a little bit.
And if Kelsey didn't get fired, and you got to make the movie you wanted to make, would that have made you happy? For a little bit.
But then Probably So, what does it matter? But there has to be more.
Well, when's the last time you were actually happy? You microchipped my penis? Check, please! Microchip.
Ah.
Oh.
Todd! Yeah.
Oh.
Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Hey.
How are you? I can't do this anymore.
You can't do what anymore? I can't talk to you on the phone all the time.
It's too hard.
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth? I think maybe we should stop calling each other, for a little bit.
I'm sorry.
I just miss you too much.
But listen, I love you.
Okay? Mr.
Peanutbutter? Uh, yeah.
Uh, okay.
I love you, Diane.
Where is he? I don't know, sir.
Can't do this to me.
Where the hell is he?
What are you doing here? You said if I was in town to give you a call.
Wanna get a drink? It's eight in the morning.
It's 5:00 p.
m.
in Los Angeles.
That's not true.
I don't know what time it is.
When's the last time you slept? You look like shit.
Really? 'Cause you look like a million Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
What about the store? What if somebody has an emergency and they need more turquoise shit? It's New Mexico.
They'll find it.
It's really good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
I can't wait for you to meet Kyle and the kids.
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me that's the name of your band.
So, who are you again? You were friends with Mom when she lived in L.
A.
? Your mom never mentioned she used to hang out with the BoJack Horseman? Star of screen and book? Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles? Never came up? All these years? It was a long time ago.
Oh, gross.
Mom, Trip has a boner again.
Trip.
Trip, let's dial back the boners.
Gross.
What? I can't help it.
Trip, ew.
You are at the breakfast table with your parents, your big sister, and an old man.
What could possibly be arousing you? Am I the old man? I don't understand how it works.
I was just excited that I finished the maze on the back of the cereal box.
So, BoJack.
What brings you to Tesuque? So, we're just gonna change the subject and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv right now? Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.
Charlotte told me if I was ever in New Mexico I should call her.
But what are you doing in New Mexico? Yeah, what are you doing in New Mexico? I, uh You didn't drive all this way just to see my mom, did you? No, of course not.
That would be crazy, to come all this way just to see a woman I haven't had a real conversation with in 30 years.
I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
Uh Because she has a family, which is great.
Yeah.
You guys are great.
Yeah.
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.
Mm.
On my way to see On your way to sea? Yes.
To the sea.
To the shining sea.
Because I'm here to buy a boat.
At the Santa Fe Boat Show.
I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.
That's 'cause it's a secret boat show.
Invitation-only.
Huh.
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries and big-time celebrities and kings.
Wow.
Hold up.
If you live in Los Angeles, which is right on the ocean, why would you drive all the way here to go to a boat show in the middle of landlocked New Mexico? Jeez, so many questions.
What is this, Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities, What Do They Know, Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out? Oh, gotta take this.
It's my boat guy.
Hello? Okay, so I got Turtel Hey, Knute.
You got any leads for me, boat-wise? What? Sounds perfect, Knute.
Now tell me, do we need a poop deck? Huh? Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
BoJack In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that.
What's going on? Where the hell are you? Tesuque.
Te-who-ka? Tesuque, New Mexico.
Outside Santa Fe.
Are you te-stupid? If you don't get your ass back te-set, you're gonna get te-sued.
Just get me a couple of days.
For what? What are you doing there? I don't know, I just This isn't what I expected.
Well, I can probably stave them off till Monday if you get pinkeye.
Can you get pinkeye? I have to go.
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back? Soon.
Yep, I want the starboard to be fully starboard.
What? And the port to be also starboard.
Huh? Thanks a lot.
Goodbye.
Wait, BoJack Hey.
I'm really glad you're here.
Oh, yeah uh, me, too.
I hope this isn't weird for you.
You know, me having a family and Why would it be weird? At our age, it's weird if you don't have a family.
I mean Well, not for you.
No.
'Cause you've been busy.
Right.
With your career.
Sure, yeah, my career has kept me super busy.
Anyway, I know you're just in town for the boat show, but seriously make yourself at home.
I really don't want to impose.
If there's anything I can do to help around here Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving after school today, but now he's gotta take Trip to his dumb-ass basketball game.
It's the quarter-finals.
You'll just get a hard-on in the game.
Now I will get a hard-on because you made me think about it.
Thanks a lot.
I'll take you driving this weekend.
I need to practice every day.
I'm the only senior who still doesn't have a license.
It's embarrassing.
Well, I got the store, and I already took the morning off, so unless you know any other adults Can BoJack take me? Huh? What? I mean, he is an adult.
Uh Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.
Well, I guess I could make some time before the boat show.
Keep your eyes on the road, both hands on the wheel.
Okay.
And don't text and drive, unless it's an emergency, like you have a really funny thing that you just have to text someone.
Got it.
So, let me ask you something.
Tsk.
Do your parents really love each other, or is it a stay-together-for-the-kids situation? What? Why would you ask me that? I don't know.
Just making conversation.
Why do we keep passing the same house? No, I don't.
Shut up.
You shut up.
What's the story? Cute guy live there? Girl you hate? College kid that gives you Adderall? Okay, fine.
That's Diego Mendoza's house.
He's just this stupid guy.
He's in my calculus class, and sometimes we'll do this thing where he goes, "Hey," and then I go, "Hey.
" Then he goes, "What's the homework?" and I tell him.
It's not like a big deal or anything, but it's like this thing we do.
Cool thing.
So, anyway My best friend, Alison F.
was talking to Rachel Kaplan.
Do I really need to know these names? Rachel heard from Ray-Ray and the Bean that Diego said if prom happened right now he'd want to go with Ali Sandler, and I'm like, "Yeah, pfft, okay, dude.
" You know what I mean? You know I don't know any of these people, right? But then he said since prom's not for another two months, he could "foresee a situation" where he would want to go with me, because he knows I'm a real girl who's mostly chill.
If you're so mostly chill, why do you keep driving by his house? In case he comes out, to, like, check the mail or something.
I'll get out of the car and be like, "That's so funny.
I was just going for a drive.
" And he'll be like, "Oh, hey.
" And I'll be like, "Hey.
" 'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
That's the whole plan? Well, it's better than your plan for buying a boat in New Mexico.
Dude, what are you really doing here? I didn't like the person I was in L.
A.
And I didn't know where else to go.
Please do not tell your parents.
Well, I won't, but I think people are gonna notice if you go to a boat show and don't come back with a boat.
Oh, my God, there he is.
Get down! Oh, my God.
Oh! What are you doing? What happened to your plan? Oh! I panicked.
I didn't know he'd be wearing a tank top.
Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
Yeah, deal.
They didn't even put me in.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You did some great cheering from the bench, and for someone who never plays, you sweat a lot.
Maybe they'll put me in next game.
Sure, they will.
No way they'll do that.
What the? Huh? Whoa! Whoa! What a boat.
Can I go on your boat? I don't see what's stopping you.
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat! I got my way! Where's your car? I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat? Uh well Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.
On a boat! Think of the amount of floating! Please stay out of the bedroom.
Does she have a name? Who? The boat? It does not.
Come on.
You gotta give her a name.
You should call her the Escape From L.
A.
That actually is a good name for it, the nongendered object.
Oh, she's a good girl.
I can tell, she's a good girl, isn't she? Or are you a bad girl? Are you flirting with my boat right now? No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.
Mind if I get on top of her? Knock yourself out.
Dad, don't be gross.
Wow, you really got a boat.
Yeah, sure did.
So, does that mean you're leaving? Oh, I, uh Yeah, I guess, uh I guess I did do what I came here to do.
You don't have to go right away, right? At least stay till the end of the weekend.
Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
Oh, it's no bother.
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides heh, everyone here loves you.
Uh, everyone? Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.
Too late.
Seriously, stay as long as you want.
What? BoJack, great news.
Do you still want to go to New York? Because Jill Pill Jill Pill? I don't care about this.
Okay, moving on.
Do you remember when we were at Herb's funeral and you told me? Whatever it is, I don't care.
Oh, there's a kitchen! Can we make pizza bagels? Yeah, family dinner on the boat.
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back on set Monday.
What? How long do I have to keep putting out fires for you? I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.
What? I think I might be here a while.
Listen, I Well, who's getting seasick? Just kidding.
It's such an eyesore.
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely, they'll move the boat.
BoJack? Yeah? Supper's ready.
So, I had another meeting today with the Drama Chair at SFCC.
They're gonna offer me a position.
What? That's amazing.
Oh, that's cool.
Congratulations.
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there who doesn't like my in-your-face style.
If I know me, it might lead to some pretty zany misadventures.
Mm.
Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.
It's funny you brought up the Brussels sprouts, because I think they're terrible.
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.
Penny, did you hear my bit about the Brussels sprouts? A bit is what they call a joke in show business.
Right, BoJack? That's right.
String a bunch of those together and you got yourself a riff.
You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.
Okay I think someone's in a mood.
Oh, my God.
I'm not in a mood.
Whatever.
Get bent.
I hate my life.
I can't wait to be dead.
I'll talk to her.
Everyone said for months that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
Yeah? But he keeps not doing it.
That is so typical Diego.
So, I thought, okay, if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.
Way to take initiative.
Oh.
Rookie mistake.
So, I asked him and he said no.
And then this other girl, Lyla K.
, came up to him and was just like, "Hey.
" And he was like, "Hey.
" And that's our thing.
Well, I don't want to tell tales out of school, but this Lyla K.
character sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice to not have a date, because you can actually Mom.
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school and you'd go to your sock hops.
Do you think I went to high school in the '50s? Penny, hey, I got an idea.
You should take me to the prom.
Huh? Everybody loves having BoJack around.
What? Why? Think about it.
If you went with Diego, you'd be nervous.
"Does he like me? Am I cool?" But with me you can just relax and enjoy yourself.
Diego will see you have a good time without him, and that'll make him super jealous.
So, he'll come up to you, and he'll say, "Hey.
" And then you say, "Hey.
" Oh, that's so cold.
Right? Wait Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.
How is that cold? Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?" And you'll say, "I'm busy right now.
Maybe later.
" And then never dance with him.
That'll show him.
Wait I'm sorry.
Don't you want to dance with Diego? Stop poking holes, Charlotte.
This is a great plan.
Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom! Oh, yeah, well, that's definitely the better idea.
Okay, everyone smile.
Real big.
Cheese.
I think we have enough pictures.
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.
Taking pictures before prom is so bourgeois.
And who are you again? I'm Maddy.
Maddy's my best friend.
I thought Alison F.
was your best friend.
That was like three best friends ago.
You were best friends with Alison F.
? No.
Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.
But they call me Pete Repeat because I always say everything twice.
Everything? Yeah, it's kind of my thing.
Okay.
Ah, damn.
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I? Usually I do it.
Cool.
Wow, Ray-Ray and the Bean are already posting pics on Instagram.
What? Hashtag much? Let me see.
Whoa, hold on.
Responsible adult.
What are you drinking? Nothing.
Hand it over.
Fine.
Ugh.
Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12? You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.
Do they teach you anything in school? Make a left at the light.
Where are we going? I'll get you some bourbon.
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.
Wait, really? If you're gonna drink, you should be smart about it.
Awesome.
Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"? Was it twice or was it once? Ah, it was probably twice.
Yeah, it's twice.
Pete Repeat.
Ugh.
It burns.
Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.
You want some? No, thanks.
Pussy.
I'm driving.
Well, more for me.
This prom is really bourgeois.
Lyla K.
is so pretty.
Shut up.
She's got nothing on you.
Why is nobody dancing? We gotta get this party started.
Beat it, Poindexter.
Poindexter? It's a nerd reference Just beat it.
Ah! Huh? Hey! What's the big idea? Why is there an adult at our high school prom? All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991, when a new funky-fresh dance craze took this nation by storm.
All right.
I'm listening.
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat, and here we go.
Waka waka.
Now boys and girls, if you wanna do the BoJack, take your hands and put them on your Boo! This sucks.
This guy's bad.
God, no! This is not the immediate praise I expected.
This prom sucks.
You can say that again.
I know.
My flask got empty.
Can we be back to the car, so, for more get for put in it? Or we could go back to the car and just leave.
You can't just leave the prom.
Of course you can.
You're young.
You can do whatever you want.
That's what they never tell you until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.
Yeah, is right.
Society is everywhere.
Society.
Well, what else are we gonna do? I'd say it's time to get down, time to hit the town.
Is that a lyric from that "Do the BoJack" song? Just get in the car.
Okay, one two three.
Wow.
That is so beautiful.
Hey, you wanna climb up on the water tower? We could see the whole city.
Yeah, I wanna go.
Oh.
Oh, careful there, Maddy.
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.
This is nice.
Wow, how'd you think to do all this? I don't know.
It just came to me.
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom, but I'm kind of bummed we didn't get to dance.
Well, you wanna dance? Yes, hold on.
Got it, okay.
It's buffering.
Buffering still, buffering.
This night has been so perfect.
You know, you look just like your mother.
Guys? I think you should come down here.
She's still breathing, but she won't wake up.
She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.
She can spend the night.
Maddy, come on.
No, look, my cousin had a friend who passed out like this, and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.
I really think we should get Maddy to a hospital, to a hospital.
Did you see what I did there? That's why they call me Pete Repeat.
BoJack, what do we do? Society.
Careful.
I'm being careful.
Okay.
Lock the wheels.
Watch her head.
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.
Pete, you're in charge.
Penny and I are gonna take off.
What? You don't want too many people around in a hospital setting.
If anyone asks, tell them we left the dance early, and you don't know where Maddy got the whiskey.
Why? It's one thing if a bunch of kids get drunk on prom night, but if there's an adult there, I was supposed to be responsible, and then the whole thing feels kind of creepy.
Are you sure she's gonna be okay? I don't know, BoJack.
Pete.
I'm the adult here, and I need you to listen to me.
Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.
Are we clear on this? I need you to be 100 percent with me here.
Uh Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.
It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from? I I don't know.
And what happened to your friends BoJack and Penny? They left early.
See, that's not so hard.
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.
Okay.
Is it okay? Or "okay" okay? Uh "okay" okay.
All right, that's what I thought.
You're the future of America! Go, Penny! Go, go, go! She's gonna be okay, right? She'll be fine.
It's a part of growing up.
And we did the right thing back there, you think? I Look, sometimes when you're an adult, the right thing isn't always the best thing.
Well I had a really good time tonight.
Even with all the craziness.
This was really special.
I'm glad.
You know, everyone always treats me like a kid.
You're the first grown-up I've ever met who actually treats me like you know, a person.
So, thanks.
Mwah.
Well, you're welcome, Penny.
Mm Whoa, Penny, come on.
If you want to do it, I'm ready.
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.
With your mouth? I put one on a banana in health class.
With your mouth? What kind of health class? Look, you are an amazing person, but you're 17.
Which is the legal age of consent in New Mexico.
Okay, that's not And I didn't drink tonight, so everything's totally legal.
Penny, no.
It's okay.
I want this.
No, you think you do, but You don't know what you want.
Oh, God.
This is so dumb.
No, Penny, don't I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey.
What'd you do with my daughter? She had a big night.
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys? Trip's at a friend's house and Kyle's asleep.
You know you can get your own, right? Hey, do you remember that time you, me and Herb let those balloons go over Studio City? Oh, yeah.
Didn't we attach glow sticks to them or something? Yeah.
Ooh.
That was really bad for the environment.
True, but A seagull could've choked on one of those balloons.
But it's a nice memory, right? It was a fun night.
We had a lot of fun nights.
Before you left town, you told me L.
A.
was a tar pit.
Do you remember? Oh, God.
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.
Well, do you still think it's true? Do I think L.
A.
is a tar pit? No.
No, I think you're the tar pit.
Me? No, not "you" you.
I'm just saying, like It doesn't matter where you are, it's who you are, and that's not gonna change whether you're in California or Maine or New Mexico.
You know, you can't escape you.
Ugh.
Now you sound like my mother.
No, what? No, I don't.
I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
About what? I keep making these bad decisions.
And hurting people.
Well Can I tell you a joke? Is it a long joke with no punch line? No.
Then go ahead.
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this.
" You know what the doctor says? "Don't do that.
" Yeah.
That's actually good advice.
And you know what else? The doctor in that story was a woman.
What?! Oh.
BoJack, um I think you got the wrong idea.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here right now.
No, BoJack.
You and me, this is real.
You know this is real.
My husband is right upstairs.
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.
Don't do this, BoJack.
I know you feel it, too.
So many times in my life I've done the wrong thing, but this is the right thing, and I have never been more sure of anything.
I've wasted so much time sitting on my hands and imagining what could have been.
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.
I think you should go.
Okay.
Tomorrow.
Charlotte I have worked very hard to build this life for myself.
I am happy here.
And you just roll into my life like a hurricane.
Why? Because we knew each other for five minutes 30 years ago? I don't know you.
You do.
I don't.
And you don't know me.
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.
I love you, your family and this town.
Stop.
I never wanted to hurt BoJack I'm sorry I kissed you.
I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.
Everything can go back to normal, but No, no, stop.
No.
Please, don't make me go back to L.
A.
I don't care where you go, BoJack, but I can't have you around here.
You make me too sad.
Okay.
What are you doing here? I know what I want, BoJack.
Go to bed, Penny.
Wait, what? Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
No.
Mom.
Charlotte.
Penny, go to your room.
We didn't even do anything.
Now, Penny.
Charlotte, I am so sorry Don't.
Don't you dare.
If you are not out of my driveway in 30 minutes, I will call the police.
And if you ever try to contact me or my family again, I will fucking kill you.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here? Yep, still here.
Look alive, bright eyes.
It's the morning and somebody loves you.
Right back at you, buddy.
Oh, my God.
He's here.
There he is.
I love you, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I love you, too.
Idea for a new Pixar movie: what are pizza boxes thinking about? And Leland Stanford? Transcontinental Railroad.
Transcontinental Railroad? That is correct.
Next question, what is my favorite kind of berry? Barry Bostwick.
Raspberry? I'm so sorry, the correct answer, of course, was Barry Bostwick.
How was I supposed to know? He also likes Franken Berry.
We would have accepted Franken Berry.
What? I'm sorry, you lose.
What the? That's our show, but before we go I wanna send out a quick message.
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you and I know you're doing great things.
Idea for a new app: an undo button that could undo long amounts of time.
Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha! Three months.
A year.
A life.
Erica, where did that tooth come from? All right, let's keep this party going.
One click and everything could just go back to the way it was.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here? Yup.
Still here.
Stop it.
Wake up, captain dumbshit.
I've been trying to get in touch with you for two months.
Ow.
Okay.
I'm awake, I'm awake.
Aah! What is it? If the studio wants to sue me, tell them to take my house.
I belong to the sea now.
Are you drunk? Only on adventure.
And gin.
And vodka.
And gin.
They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.
What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
I don't know, ask Turteltaub.
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.
You've been here this whole time? Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn should do Shut up.
Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.
What orphanage? Remember at Herb's funeral, I asked you what you wanted me to do with your Horsin' Around residuals? I do not remember that.
You said, "Give it to an orphanage or something.
" What? It turns out you made enough money to build a brand new one.
So congratulations.
You're a hero.
A hero? That's right, a hero.
Or is it pronounced "gyro?" I just call them subs.
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich, you're a great man.
Welcome to The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.
Or, as we call it, The BoJack Horsephanage.
You cannot call it that.
A, because I am not a great man and B, because that is a really stupid name.
The name was Molly's idea.
Stop pissing off the orphans.
A lot of them grow up to be serial killers.
Thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.
This is the only good thing I've ever done and I did it by accident.
And it just goes to show you life is just Ah, what am I saying? I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.
My parents are dead? No.
No.
Not necessarily.
Maybe they just didn't want you.
My point is, I don't understand how people live.
It's amazing to me that people wake up every morning and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it.
" How do people do it? I don't know how.
Yay.
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser must navigate the most sensitive of areas.
And I'm not just talking about the butt.
Ha.
Copernicus, how do you always come up with these amazing butt jokes? When you're a Level Nine, as I am, you don't come up with butt jokes.
You live truthfully in the moment and the butt joke comes to you.
So true.
So wise.
Listen, I need to "shove off," as we sailors say, on my comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.
I shan't be returning.
Shan't you? I shannot.
I'd like you to join me on the high seas, as my Number Two and I don't mean that kind of number two.
What, number two, how do you do that? If it isn't the furshlugginer putz who cost me 50 grand.
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of production.
If there's anything I can do.
Do? What do? Movie's finished.
We fixed the whole thing in post.
Really? Remember your first week, these nerds made a computer scan of your head so we could finish if something happened? Please don't call us nerds, sir.
Something happened to you, so these nerds finished the movie.
Look what Computer BoJack can do.
Help you out of that tree, ma'am? Look at him save that cat.
Now there's a protagonist we can root for.
You did all that in the computer? Not just that.
Computer BoJack had so much charisma and screen presence we ended up going back and replacing you in every scene.
I'm not in the movie at all? Not technically, but computer you is giving the performance of your career.
When people see what you do in this movie, they are gonna storm Daniel Day-Lewis's house, schlep him out into the street, shoot him in the head.
That's how good your performance is.
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis look like shit.
They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis.
But it's not my performance.
Explain that the widow Day-Lewis.
She'll be devastated.
Kaput.
Kapleshky.
Are you Jewish? Because I feel some of these you're just making up.
We got a screening this weekend.
Come see the movie, we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz, schlemiel, schlimazel, Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.
Just think, Carolyn, in one week, all of this will be ours.
We should a put a social-media desk there.
If we hire someone to micromanage our clients' online personas and new media outreach, they'll seem more grounded down to earth.
Smiling poop emoji, I love everything about that.
I wanna make sure the couches we get are really comfortable.
Just in case we have some late nights.
Mr.
Rabitowitz.
This is a place of business.
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment for a second? I just wanna remember this instant where for once in my life, everything was going Hold that thought.
What is it? Ugh.
My wife and I are going to the ballet tonight, there's a real ish with the restaurant.
This is the wife you're divorcing, right? You know how it is.
You say you want a divorce and she says, "No, we can make this work.
" You go to counseling and remember why you fell in love with her in the first place and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.
We've been sleeping together for three months.
We're about to start a company together.
None of that has to change.
I am definitely going to divorce her probably, it's just Ugh.
It's hard to explain to someone who's never been married.
Listen, this is Oh! Sorry, Katie just said something funny.
What? I gotta hop.
I love you, though.
Ha, ha.
Okay, keep the engine running, I'll be back in a Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.
Oh, where? The Giggleship.
It's the comedy cruise line People magazine once called "a comedy cruise line.
" Comedy cruise line? Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show? It was two months ago.
You missed it.
Sorry.
No, you're not.
Well Hey, do you remember the morning after my first night here? I don't know why everyone keeps asking if I remember things.
I don't.
Just as a general rule, if your question begins, "Do you remember" and doesn't end with "how much you hated Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.
I was so happy to have a place to stay that I made pancakes.
And you kept eating them so I kept making them.
And then you got mad at me for letting you eat so many pancakes.
You tried to chase me around the pool, but you were too hungover and also full from the pancakes so instead you took a nap.
And when you woke up, you said, "Thanks for the pancakes.
Now get out of my house.
" I don't remember any of that.
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out, just like you wanted.
Good.
Honestly, you'll probably be better off without me.
Yeah.
But we had some good times, though, right? Did we? Right.
Well, um, take care.
Hey, I hope you can find a way to be happy, BoJack.
I really do.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Todd? You need to get your shit together.
Ugh.
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.
I want you to come onboard and write celebrity tweets.
I don't know how to do that.
You're a ghost-writer.
It's the same as writing a book, they're just a lot shorter and more people read them.
All right, but why are you helping me? Because my life is a mess right now and I compulsively take care of other people when I don't know how to take care of myself.
Oh.
I was hoping it was because you believed in me.
I don't.
Welcome to my Giggleship.
For us, it's a place to realize our higher selves.
For the paying public, it's a place to watch improv and drink watered-down margaritas for 8.
99.
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.
No, no, you just get paid in experience and stage time.
Which in a way is even better than money.
Say what? Look, We've arrived at your living quarters.
Wow.
No more couch-sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.
That's the spirit.
And you can use improv to make this room anything you want it to be.
My cabin is exactly like yours, but when I use my imagination, it becomes a rich stateroom with a treasure chest full of booty.
I like a big booty, if you know what I mean.
And I don't mean a butt.
You really are the master of spontaneous witticisms.
All right, you ready? This is go time.
There's no turning back now.
Oh, I am ready.
Great.
Now let's get out there and tell all those garbage rat bastard sons of bastards what we really think of them, once and for all.
Everyone.
We have an announcement.
Guys, we have an announcement.
What's going on? Mr.
Witherspoon's in the hospital.
He had a stroke.
Oh.
Well, you know what you rat bastards can stroke? Uh Oh.
My big, hairy Well, we burned that bridge.
Todd, you should be up a magician's sleeve because you are a card.
Hey, Bryan.
What's going on here? He refused to scrub the floors.
Oh, Bryan.
Please.
My knees were cramping so I needed to stand.
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.
That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.
I'm gonna go to Copernicus and get this sorted out.
Copernicus? Uh, Copernicus? Huh? Huh.
Whoa.
One Hundred and One Butt Jokes? "No parking in the rear?" Aah! Copernicus is a fraud! A fraud? Me? Ow.
Aah.
I had such high hopes for you, Todd.
Normally, I'd make a perfectly timed butt joke here, but as you can see, I don't have my book.
Oh! Guards, take this subversive to the Yes And room.
No.
Hey, what are you doing? No.
Shame on all of you! Just wait till you see my Trip Advisor review.
This cruise is getting three stars.
Because I have very mixed feelings about it.
Carolyn, we are free.
Yeah.
Real quick, kiss me once.
Then kiss me twice.
I don't want to do that anymore.
I told you, we can make this work No.
I don't want Carolyn, you're a single woman in your 40s.
Can you really afford to be picky? What? I'm just saying, what, you think you're gonna find some perfect unattached guy who's gonna love you like I do? Who's gonna make you laugh and feel good about yourself? This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.
If you're holding out for something better, well, I hate to break it to you, but you're gonna be alone for a long time.
I'm not afraid of being alone.
And you might wanna find someplace else to work because you're not coming with me.
Wait, wait, wait, what? It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.
I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.
Whoa, Carolyn, we just Come Carolyn.
My name is Princess Carolyn.
And as I held that baby in my arms, I knew I had been given a second chance.
A chance to finally make things right.
And this time, I was gonna win the race of life.
Whoa.
That was actually good.
We're doing a full awards push.
You should clear your schedule for the next year.
Buckle up, buddy, this is the year of Secretariat.
But it wasn't Secretariat.
And it wasn't me.
It was a computer.
What difference does it make? Smile and collect your trophies.
You know Ana Spanikopita? Hello.
Aah! They call her the Oscar whisperer.
Ana Spanikopita.
Big fan.
Thank you, it's I meant you are going to be a big fan of me because I am going to win you an Oscar.
Ana is the best there is.
You better start writing your speech.
I don't have to thank my parents, do I? You're funny.
I am literally laughing out loud.
Uh We gotta get you on a talk show.
You have any weird history with Kelly Ripa I should know about? No.
Well, define "weird.
" You look doughy.
Do you run? Cardio? Anything? I mean, occasionally.
Excuse me? That was such a beautiful performance.
So brave.
Thank you.
Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that? Feel that energy! They don't love me.
They don't know me.
That's why they love you.
He's right.
Our research shows America likes to think they know you, and then they like learning more about you, but at a certain point they pass a threshold where they actually know you and then they find you weird and off-putting.
Are you saying that nobody who really knows me could ever love me? No, no, no.
Not nobody.
No.
No.
What am I doing here? I don't know where you're going, but if you could run there.
Sextina, hi.
Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.
Listen, chitch, if you're going to tweet for Sextina Aquafina, you need to capture the essence of my personal brand, okay? All upper caps, no punctuation, lots of cryptic bullshit about the Illuminati and make sure to mention my preferred brands, okay? Beats by Dre, Abercrombie and Fitch and brand fin polish.
Can you spell that last one? No.
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.
Hey, thank you so much.
You people are the real stars.
Huh? Hi.
I'm Sarah Koenig.
This is one ringtone told over the course of several rings.
And the story it's telling you is to answer your phone.
Hello? Hey, Diane.
Hey.
Uh So How's Cordovia? It's hard.
Do you know where the batteries are? What? The batteries in the remote died.
Did you check the junk drawer? Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.
I'm gonna take them out of the smoke detector.
No, don't do that.
Well, I'm out of options.
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I think maybe you should get back here so you can help me find the batteries.
Yeah? I know you're doing important work and it's a long way to travel, but I need you here and I think you should come home.
Is that really what you want? Of course it is.
Well, okay, I'm looking at this website right now and it says if I leave immediately, I can still make it home tonight.
That sounds great.
I love you.
I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.
There is a woman in this restaurant who looks just like you.
I guess I just have one of those faces.
Okay, party people, we have time for one more suggestion.
Todd.
Did someone say movie theater? I heard movie theater.
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear my giant hat to the movies.
Who's this sitting behind me? John Wilkes Booth.
Uh-oh.
Todd, it's me, BoJack.
BoJack? Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
I can't leave.
I need to take suggestions.
Okay, well, here's a suggestion, your name is Todd.
You're 24, you live on my couch and you've always seen the good in me somehow.
You've been brainwashed into thinking that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.
If you're any kind of improviser, you'll take that suggestion and you'll run with it.
Huh.
Let's get out of here.
I'm afraid that getting out of here is not an option.
You've seen too much.
What the hell are you gonna do about it? Stop you.
With these.
Oh, no.
Don't do anything crazy, guys.
You can't be serious.
Just get behind me, BoJack.
No sudden moves.
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.
Especially not when I have this smoke bomb.
Ka-pow! I've lost them.
Where did they go? Seriously? Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen with SPF a million which protects against flamethrowers.
Oh, no.
Now we finish this with our strangle machine.
Beep, boop, boop.
Machine? Strangle those guys.
Ugh! BoJack, help.
There is literally nothing happening to you.
You don't understand, if you die in improv, you die in real life.
So stupid.
Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine? Beep, boop, beep.
No.
I have a wife and children.
Well, they're improvised, but they're real to me.
Can this be the end? This whole ship is full of idiots.
Beep, boop.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.
Wait.
Where are you going? Sorry, improv is fun and great and everything, but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.
Your friend? I didn't realize this man was your friend.
Well, then, by all means, go with him, Todd.
But, see, I thought this was the man who sabotaged your rock opera.
The one who constantly abuses you and makes you shower with a hose in the yard.
I invited him to.
The one who's never said a kind word to you the entire time you've known him.
Is this your friend, Todd? It's more complicated than that.
Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
More than that, we're a family.
I, uh Hash browns.
What? I heard hash browns.
Martha, did you see my hash browns? Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off? It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.
You kept making them and I kept eating them and then I threw up in the pool.
That made you throw up in the pool.
Then I got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.
But, you said, "I'll clean it up.
" And did I clean it up? No.
You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.
Ha, ha.
And you said, "Thank you for letting me stay here.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
" And I remember when you said that, "I don't have anywhere else to go," because I felt good about myself.
And I don't feel that way a lot.
Letting you stay with me was the best thing I ever did on purpose.
I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.
Because you're my best friend, Todd.
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all that up, that was some really good improv.
Game recognize game.
Why do you have a boat? Uh, I don't remember.
Hello? Prince? Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls from this New York playwright, she really wants to talk to you.
She says you know her, Jill Pill? Jill Pill? Ring any bells? Apparently, she worked on your TV show.
Horsin' Around? No, actually.
The other TV show.
Other TV show? Oh, shit.
Jill.
I'm moving into the new office and I got Herb's ashes here.
I really don't know what to do with this thing.
Do you want it? Yeah.
Why did I take you with me? Herb loved orphans.
Mostly as a delivery apparatus for hackneyed punchlines and mawkish sentimentality, but still.
And we will do our part to honor his legacy.
Hey, who's Jerb? What? Jerb Ka Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?" Your e-mail said "Jerb.
" I forwarded it to the plaque guy.
Is it not? No, obviously that was a typo.
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz? Kind of sounds like something you'd get at a Mediterranean restaurant, but wouldn't finish.
And the waiter would say, "You want me to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?" And you'd say, "No.
" You gotta fix this.
Really? We spent a lot of money on this plaque, you know? And on the t-shirts.
Jerb's kids? No, there's no Jerb.
It's Herb.
T-shirt's say Jerb so I'm going by the t-shirts.
You know, Herb would probably think that this is pretty funny that you couldn't even get this right.
Yeah.
He would.
So, in a way Yeah.
You wanna get some Mediterranean food? You read my mind.
Oh, God.
Lungs on fire.
Ow.
Crap.
I hate this.
Running is terrible.
Everything is the worst.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It gets easier.
Huh? Every day, it gets a little easier.
Yeah? But you gotta do it every day.
That's the hard part.
But it does get easier.
Okay.
It's a dream come true.
(WOMAN) You've been trying to get this movie made for 20 years.
Did you ever think you'd be sitting here, talking about Secretariat? Sitting here? In this hotel room? (CLEARS THROAT) It's a dream come true.
What's it like to play Secretariat? Dream come true.
Playing Secretariat, what was that like? Dream come true.
(WOMAN) How long you in New York for? Just a couple days of fun interviews, then it's off to Chicago for more fun interviews, and then, if I don't blow my brains out, I get to go back to L.
A.
Darling, you're doing marvelously, I am so proud of you.
If I could make one slight adjustment? Maybe fewer jokes about how these interviews make you want to blow your brains out? Right.
Sorry.
I am so thrilled to be here, talking with, uh -Yahoo Finland.
-Yahoo Finland.
Are you Finnish? No, we are just getting started.
Walked right into that one.
What would an Oscar nomination mean for Mr.
BoJack Horseman? Any award recognition is just gravy.
The real joy is to sit in this hotel room all day, answering the same questions over and over again.
Great answers, you're divine.
I'm in love with you.
One small adjustment.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.
Just write a script for me, so I don't have to think for myself.
Honey, I would shove my hand up your ass and control your mouth like a Muppet if it would win you an Oscar.
What do I know? I'm just the publicist you hired to help win you an Oscar.
(WOMAN) What's it like to play Seabiscuit? I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.
(MAN) Your last attempt at a comeback was The BoJack Horseman Show.
Pass.
(MAN 2) People still see you as the guy from that sucky show from the '90s.
Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.
Yeah, but it was.
It lasted nine seasons.
Its whole purpose was for people to watch it so the network could sell ad time, so the show could make more money than it cost to produce.
It did that well.
It was a good show.
Yes, but it sucked.
It didn't suck! Great job today.
It could not have gone better.
My only note would be stop defending Horsin' Around.
Why? Millions of people loved it! We need to use these next few months to define your story.
When people see you they need to think Oscar winner, not dumb asshole from an old TV show that nobody cares about.
Okay, I hear what you're saying, but we can both agree Horsin' Around was a good show, right? BoJack, you know I think the world of you.
I think you are so smart and attractive, so I'm not going to mince words.
Horsin' Around was a piece of shit.
(FUNKY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Looking good.
Fantastic.
You need a coaster.
I told you to wear lipstick and underpants, Teresa.
I put everything bill-related in one folder.
Gas bill, cable bill, and the new headshots for Billy Zane.
Thank you, Judah.
You also wanted me to remind you to call Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Yeah.
Ping me again in two minutes? No, five minutes.
Uh, when's our call with BoJack and Spanakopita? The one that started seven minutes ago? It started seven minutes ago.
What? Diane's in your office right now, stalling poorly.
And that is my opinion on the Octomom.
Remember Octomom? (ANA) Diane, are you stalling for Princess Carolyn? What? You know who was good at stallin' was Joseph Stalin.
(CHUCKLES) (BOJACK) If anything, Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.
Get your head out of your ass.
He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn, who's been here the whole time? Hey, buddy.
How was your first big day at the press junket? (SIGHS) Endless.
It was like the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.
He was exquisite.
The movie's tracking really well on social.
New media impressions are up 23 percent across platforms.
What does that mean? Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.
(CLEARS THROAT) But I keep tweeting things and they keep getting retweeted, so we're doing something right.
Yesterday I dropped my phone in the bathroom which made BoJack's Instagram post a picture of the floor, with the caption "spujb.
" That got 4000 likes.
(ANA) Great.
I am exhausted.
Being a movie star is the hardest job.
And we get no recognition.
(GRUNTS) Okay, you're gonna love this.
I pulled some strings at Manatee Fair and set up an interview tomorrow night.
BoJack is not ready for a magazine feature.
Relax.
It's not that big a deal.
I didn't realize you were an authority on deal size.
(PRINCESS CAROLYN) Listen, Moussaka Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.
I can do all the bullshit things Ana's scheduled for me in the morning and still have time for Princess Carolyn's bullshit thing tomorrow night.
Now, pajamas.
Whaa! (GASPING) Todd?! What is going on over there? (ANA) BoJack smuggled a young boy into his room.
No big deal.
Movie stars do it all the time.
Where am I? (SNIFFS) Bagels? Pizza? (SNIFFING) Hipsters? Urine? Am I in Minneapolis? What? No, you're in New York.
FOLLOW-UP: why are you in New York? Beats me.
Sometimes I just am places.
(MOANING) I can't get to sleep.
Oh, God.
(GROANS) Yeah, that'll do it.
(SIGHS) Is my name Sarah Koenig? Because I'm about to get cereal.
(MOANS) I am the queen.
Follow me, citizens.
There are no sad times in our cave of possibilities.
(SIGHS AND SNORES) (GRUNTING) (MONITOR BEEPS) (BEEPING) Huh.
Small bottle of shampoo?! Not on my watch! (ALARM RINGING) (SCREAMING) You better not have gotten your failure stink all over my important movie star clothes.
Ohh I didn't mean that.
You're my friend and you don't stink of failure.
Your stink is one of good intentions and youthful exuberance.
(TODD) Hooray, compliment! You wanted me to ping you regarding Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on, I have to make a quick call.
What? You're already on a call.
Sorry.
Please hold.
(ANA) This is ridiculous.
Hello? (PRINCESS CAROLYN) It's your agent! I wanted to remind you of your meeting with Pinky today.
I think I'm already in it.
(ANNOYED THROAT CLEARING) Do I need to be on this call still? I put you on conference.
How do I? BoJack Horseman, is that you?! Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic you posted yesterday.
Spujb! Classic BoJack.
We should get together sometime and take a selfie.
I'd love to, buddy, but I'm kinda in New York right now.
(PEANUTBUTTER) New York City?! They make such great salsa.
I'm here too, honey.
Have a great meeting! Diane?! Wait, you went to New York? (DIANE) No.
I'm just on-Why wouldn't you tell me? How long are you-I'm not accusing.
I just I feel safer when I know that I know where you are.
I affirm your feelings (BOJACK) I don't want to-your feelings have value, but I'm not in New York, I'm just on the conference call.
Guys, can we (PEANUTBUTTER) I feel heard.
(DIANE) I hear that you feel heard.
What the hell is happening? Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter, I'm in New York! What?! (TODD) As Carrie from Sex and the City might say I'm Carrie.
(PEANUTBUTTER) Todd? In the naked city? (CHUCKLING) That is going to lead to some wackiness.
You mark my words.
Would you guys literally mark my words? I do want to refer back to this later on.
We're in the middle of a meeting! (PEANUTBUTTER) Got to go.
It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.
Right? Oh, yeah.
Somebody did their research on J.
D.
Salinger.
Rabbit, Run? That's Updike, you illiterate.
What's Updike? Not much, dyke, what's up with you? Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now? Has it been reclaimed? I honestly can't keep track.
Who are you asking? (ANA) We're hanging up now, goodbye.
Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.
I want to find one of those fortune telling robots that can make me big! (GROANS) Hey, champ, I have a very important job for you.
Why don't you go get us some ice? You don't need to patronize me.
But, yeah, I can do that important job.
(BOJACK) Don't get lost, buddy! I'm not gonna get lost.
The city's on a grid, why would I get Oh, no.
Hello? Are you still there? They may have hung up.
I have some good news for once.
I just got promoted to head of programming.
I'm no longer a passenger on the burning wreckage of an industry that is broadcast television.
I'm a captain! What happened to Wanda? You didn't hear? She got poached.
Oh, God! By another company.
Oh, good.
They shot her.
Oh, God! Straight to the top of the corporate ladder! Oh, good.
She had to move to Detroit.
Oh, God! Which I hear is due for a resurgence.
Can we get to the goddamn point, please? Anyway, the network is finally breaking even, thanks to the runaway success of Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out! Not to mention its companion show Talking Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out, With Chris Hardwick.
So as long as you two stick around I'm taking the show off the air.
Wait, what? Why?! I told the story I wanted to tell.
To prolong it for commercial reasons would be crass and inorganic.
Uh At long last the public knows what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know and what they don't know.
(MOANING) Did they know things? (WHIMPERS) Well, we found out.
This is a nightmare.
Why does everything I love fall apart as soon as I touch it? Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.
I am no Christopher from the Tesla dealership.
Is this as good as it gets? Or are we living in the ghost town where once my career did blossom? Who will speak my name when I am gone? Who will sing lamentations for he who once talked soup? (GROANS) What legacy of ruin am I left with? What rewards have I reaped for the damage done? I do not miss the spotlight's glare, but I do a little, miss sunshine.
(SOBBING) (GASPS AND GROWLS) But before you fold the omelette, I'd like the chef to hold the pan up and whisper his or her dreams into it.
Whisper dreams into omelette.
Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all.
Thanks.
You look different.
Older.
A lot older.
I'm not saying you look bad, just much, much, much older.
Thank you, Jill.
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers recently, have you? Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked to him since the show was canceled.
I worry about him.
About six months back, he disappeared, stopped returning my calls.
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls? Promise me you'll check on him when you get back to L.
A.
Maybe swing by his house? I think you owe him that much.
Fine.
Listen, about the play The Tragedy of Greg KingLear, a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill? Right.
That's dead.
Over.
A thing that happened that happens no longer, like a whimper in the wind.
Okay.
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.
We shout into the void, "Hey, you!" And the void says, "Stop shouting at me, please!" And we grab the void and we spit in its face, "Sir, I will not.
" Boy, did New York do a number on you.
Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you, BoJack Horseman, completely naked and covered in milk.
I'll stop you there.
It's a symbol for rebirth.
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.
I'm still recovering from being birthed the first time.
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things that are challenging, or edgy, or covered in milk.
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.
I want to do things that connect with people, things that last.
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.
No, I know, but see, years after I die, people will still be able to see me in Secretariat.
And then what? And then I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.
And then what? Then my life will have meaning.
I don't know! Mm-hmm.
You know what the real tragedy of Greg KingLear is? Two hours long without an intermission? It's that he's a marionette.
And he doesn't even know someone else is pulling his strings.
Mmm, I don't think the chef whispered his dreams into this.
This does not taste like dreams.
You told me I would be getting more attention at a smaller agency, but if anything, I'm getting less.
Is this the best time to be on your phone? I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email What? Why isn't it sending? Judah! I'm taking my business to Gekko Rabitowitz.
What? No! J.
D.
Salinger is too big a star to be hamstrung by some rinky-dink operation working out of a two-story warehouse.
I need an agency with at least nine stories.
Uh That was a reference to my work, with which you are clearly not familiar.
Oh Goodbye.
Hello to you, Rasputin.
Give my regards to the czar.
I will relay the message.
Oh, I don't know why I thought I could do this.
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.
I believe I can take on more responsibility around here.
On a provisional basis, of course.
Okay.
But we're a small agency and we need to think like one.
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner, we should focus on better gigs for the clients we already have.
Oh.
Like Jerry Maguire.
Yes.
What part of Jerry Maguire? The part where Tom Cruise's agent got him a massive payday for being in Jerry Maguire.
(RINGTONE) Who's that dog? Mister Peanutbutter Princess Carolyn?! Listen, kid, tough break about the Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities Whatever, Whatever, Whatever, but what are we gonna do next? I was looking forward to taking some time off.
What? That is the worst idea I've ever heard.
You're the biggest name in TV right now.
and every network would love to air your next project.
Why don't you get off your lazy keister and come up with some TV ideas and make us all billionaires? Go get us some money.
Go get it, boy.
You can do it! Go! Atta boy! (BARKING) Daddy, it's so nice having you home.
These last few months have been amazing.
My blood pressure's down, my stress is down.
(ENGINE REVVING) Oh, what the? There's my favorite accountant! Great news! P.
B.
Livin' is back No! No! in business! No! Yes! -Here we go! -Oh, God, no, please.
It's gonna be great, as it always is, from my perspective.
Dad, you promised we were gonna play catch, and then we'd listen to your favorite Harry Chapin song together! You never told me what it was! Oh, it's Cat's in the Cradle, but don't listen to it now! I'm gonna go listen to it.
No! The lyrics are too relevant.
Don't do it.
No! (ENGINE REVVING) (BOTH LAUGHING) So, what's next for BoJack? What do you mean, "What's next?" Why does everything have to have a next? I just mean, after Secretariat's all over, what are you going to do next? We were told this feature would be pegged to the release of Secretariat.
It is, but we also want to get to know the real BoJack.
Do we? If you want the real BoJack, there's a book written about that.
But that was BoJack before the book came out.
Who's BoJack now? Who's BoJack now? BoJack is just He's a guy who could use a drink, that's who! Should we order alcohol? Heather, could we have a moment of privacy, please? Sure.
I'll just plug my ears and sing an old sea shanty.
Oh, the sea she be a salty lass With a hi, ho, barrel of rum Sweetheart, I don't think we need to be drinking tonight.
Trust me, you do not want me to do this sober.
You don't need to micromanage everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.
All right.
You clearly have everything under control.
Raise the mast and raise your glass And banish ye dragons To where they come from! GarÃ§on, dos whiskey sours, por favor? Actually, make it tres.
And whatever the lady wants.
Did mama bear finally leave? She's a human, but yes.
Well, when the cat's away Again, a human.
I like where you're going with this.
I gotta tell you, I really loved the movie.
You're definitely going to win an Oscar.
That "You Are Secretariat" scene? Oh, it made me wet.
It made you wet?! Yeah.
"Wet" is manatee slang.
It refers to a feeling of comfort and warmth, because a manatee's natural habitat is water.
Oh, okay.
It also made me really horny.
Uh That's narwhal slang.
You know, because they have horns.
(BOTH CHUCKLING) (TODD) When I first came to New York I was young, full of hope.
But you get lost in this town.
One day you look in the mirror and think to yourself, "Who is this sad, broken man?" Listen, kid, I don't need your life story.
I just came out here to commit suicide.
No, don't! Crap! Forgot I could fly.
(CHUCKLING AND KISSING) The first thing you notice about BoJack is he's got a nice buzz going.
Oh, one final question.
Are you more man than horse? Or are you more horse than man? What the hell does that mean? Take off your city clothes and let's be animals! I want to get natural! (LAUGHING) Okay! A manatee and a horse making out with each other.
Just like in nature.
In the old days sailors thought manatees were mermaids.
Remember that episode of Horsin' Around where Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid? I don't want to think about that show.
I didn't come back to your hotel room because you're a goofy dad who once got his dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.
I'm pretty sure that never happened on the show.
If I'm going to sacrifice my journalistic integrity, it's because I'm having sex with a movie star.
And they're off! (CHUCKLING) (HEATHER) You like that, little horsie? (BOJACK) Yeah.
But I don't need you to talk.
(HEATHER) I'm a mermaid, baby.
Gonna climb up onto your boat.
(BOJACK) What? (HEATHER) What happened? Sorry, I just Give me a minute.
(HEATHER) You want me to touch it, blow on it, sing it happy birthday? (BOJACK) No, no, just Why did you say that thing about the boat? I don't know, I was being sexy.
You okay? Just forget it.
You ruined it.
(EXHALES) You want to talk about it? There's nothing to talk about.
It was a misunderstanding, that's all.
She just walked in at the worst possible It-It wasn't my fault, uh, right? I don't know what you're talking about.
On the boat, there was a girl.
What? In New Mexico.
And she trusted me.
I keep asking myself if her mother didn't walk in, would I have done it? And part of me is sure that I-I couldn't.
But another part knows that's a lie.
How do you make something right when you've made it so wrong you can never go back? I just think you have to keep moving forward? (SIGHS) Yeah.
All my life that's all I've ever done.
What's it gotten me? Well, hey, look, you're the star of a movie now.
You're probably gonna win an Oscar.
I'm not even in it.
That's not me.
What do you mean, that's not you? I was digitally replaced.
Special effects.
None of it's me.
Wow, that's (SIGHS) That's quite a story.
I shouldn't even be here.
It's been a long night.
Why don't we go to bed? In the morning, everything will be okay.
(LAMP CLICKS) (SIGHS) (TRAFFIC OUTSIDE, FAINT) (SNORTS) (MOANS) Oh, shit.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING) BoJack? It's 4:00 am.
No, it's 7:00.
I'm in New York.
I'm calling from the future.
(DROWSILY) Is that BoJack Horseman? What is this, a crossover episode? What do you want? Let's say, hypothetically, you had some information about me.
You were gonna write about it, I wanted to stop you before you could get it published.
What would be a smart thing I could do in that situation that would change your mind? Are we fighting about the book again? I don't remember where we left off last time.
No.
Diane, not everything is about you.
For once, I have a problem, I need your help.
Okay, walk me through it again? I don't have time! It's already three hours later here! Thanks a lot.
Once again, you've been no help whatsoever.
Spoiler from the future, you suck.
Sorry, you don't suck.
I'm just very stressed out right now.
Bye.
(GROANS) Oh, come on, come on.
I'm aware of the situation and I'm handling it.
But I haven't even-I'm handling it.
I'll see you at the screening tonight.
But Don't be late.
BoJack! Huh? There you are.
Stay right there.
You will not believe the night I had.
This city will eat you alive.
Did you get the ice? (GROANS) I'll be right back.
I'm lost again! (PEANUTBUTTER) All right, Oxnard.
We are looking at a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Too bad Todd's not here.
He's always the best at coming up with ideas that at first might seem terrible Right.
If he was here, he'd probably say something like, "Hey, you know what's cool? Spaghetti strainers!" Go on.
And you'd say, "I feel like I've seen that somewhere before.
" Hah! That is so me! And then he'd say, "What if I told you that this spaghetti strainer is also a hat?" A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat? That is a brilliant idea! That's a terrible idea.
That's my point! Put that in the maybe pile.
Right now, we need to focus on TV shows.
I'm sure Todd would suggest, A Spaghetti Strainer THAT'S ALSO A HAT: The TV Show.
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.
No! Nobody's done anything.
Oxnard, I want you to buy out the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.
I'm putting all my money in spaghetti strainers for this show.
How is this a show? Don't ask me.
It's your idea.
(SIGHS) (VEHICLE STOPPING) (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) I took care of our problem.
What did you do? You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.
Ana There-There was a moment back at the hotel where I really thought I blew it, I was scared it was all over, and-And then after, I was relieved.
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.
I don't know if I want to.
Stop punishing yourself.
I was in New Mexico.
None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.
We get to decide what our story is.
Nobody else gets to tell you what your story is.
What is my story? I'll tell you.
This has been your dream for the last 30 years.
You made it happen.
An Oscar won't make you happy forever, it won't solve all your problems.
You win that Oscar, the next day you go back to being you.
But that night is a really good night.
I think you deserve a really good night, and I know how to get you there.
Do you want that? Yes, I do.
Go introduce your movie.
Tell your story.
Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.
Being Secretariat isn't just about running fast.
Secretariat's a state of mind.
It's about doing the right thing, standing up for yourself.
Why, I look around and I see a whole room full of Secretariats.
You are Secretariat.
And you are Secretariat.
And you are Secretariat.
BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie and I think such a textured performance.
When you were on Horsin' Around, could you ever have imagined that you'd give a performance like this? Yes.
Actually, I imagined it a lot.
(LAUGHTER) I always knew I was more than just a dumb TV actor.
Even if other people didn't always know that.
(LAUGHTER) Seriously, though that TV show it wasn't me.
This movie is me.
And I can't tell you how great it feels to finally be doing the kind of work that I can be proud of.
Whoa.
So, that was weird.
Yeah.
Wait.
Why did you think that was weird? You know, you and me together, weird.
So it's not because I did that talking penis thing, right? Just the general concept of us sleeping together that's weird, right? Yeah.
(MAN) Good morning, Hollywood.
It's a beautiful morning in sunny 2007.
Oh, my God, 2007? Is that what time it is? I gotta get my Uggs on and get to work.
Well, you sure you don't want to just hang around for a little bit? I got no plans.
No, sadly, I have to go to my job, to help my boss find gigs for you to turn down.
If Marv brought me something good, I would do it.
Besides, I'm still decompressing from my last gig.
Horsin' Around? That ended 11 years ago.
Really? Where does the time go? (GULPING) What, you're just gonna stay at home and get drunk all day? Don't climb up my ass.
I invited you to play hooky and hang out with me.
I got a new HD DVD player.
Let's get wrecked and get Shreked.
BoJack, last night was fun and you're sweet, sort of.
I don't want to make a thing of this.
We agree.
It's not a thing.
Not a thing.
Definitely not a thing.
No, this is not a thing.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLING) Yeah.
(FUNKY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (POP MUSIC PLAYING) Generic 2007 pop song Auto-tuned So all the voices sound weird Ah! This is a pop song It's 2007 Hey, Todd, I think you just got a text.
"Who do you like, question mark, colon, bracket"? That's a smiley face, homeslice.
Who do you like? I don't like anyone.
That's ridonkulous.
You have to like someone.
If I have to, I guess, uh Kimber? (GROANS) Everyone likes Kimber.
That's like saying you like Fergie.
Who do you like? I'm not allowed to like anyone.
My dad is real strict.
Do you know The Sopranos? The show, or that weird saxophone that Kenny G plays? The show, about the guy in the mob? That's what my dad does.
Whoa! Hey, speaking of mobs, we gotta bounce if we're gonna make that flash mob at the Grove.
Man, I love flash mobs.
And I love you-Ubisoft's "Assassin's Creed".
It's a new video game.
Okay, let's go flash mob.
Whoo! Flash mobs.
This ain't 2006 It's 2007 I just don't know how I feel about my husband doing a bunch of wacky commercials overseas.
Not overseas, underseas.
You're looking at the new face of Seaborn's Seahorse Milk.
What the hell is seahorse milk? Beats me, but you better believe I'm trusting Seaborn's.
For all my seahorse milk needs.
It just seems a little cheesy.
Hey, I'm not too big for anything.
And my flip phone is blowing up with opportunities.
Michael Vick made me a very strange offer.
But I'm gonna hear him out.
Always take the meeting.
Ahem.
Can I help you? I'll have an Americano with steamed milk instead of water.
One latte? For you, my second and final wife? Oh, I usually like a cool drink when it's hot outside and a warm drink when it's cold outside.
But today is a perfect day, so-One lukewarm coffee for my gorgeous spouse.
Name? Jessica, obviously.
I'm Jessica Biel? Mmm uh From Stealth? Summer Catch? Rules Of Attraction? Nothing? (SIGHS) Girl from Seventh Heaven who took her clothes off for that magazine? Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Blarn? That's my name.
So she kissed a girl, huh? And she liked it? This I gotta see.
Talk to you later.
P.
C.
, where are you hiding? Right out here, Marv, same place I've been for the last 14 years.
Get in here and tell me what scripts I read this weekend.
We have three standouts here.
A feature called No Country For Old Men.
It's about a hunter who-(SNORING) Sorry, I fell asleep for a second.
Because that title's too long.
No Country For Old Men It's About A Hunter Who? Pass.
Aaah! Titles should be two words.
Pretty Woman.
Beautiful Girls.
Private Parts.
Then you might not like this next one, There Will Be Blood? There will not be blood.
I would have accepted There Will, or Be Blood.
Firm pass.
Oh! This last one is really special.
It's a TV pilot from a veteran sitcom writer named Cuddlywhiskers called Hmm Mitch's Life.
Now there's a title.
I think if we attach the right talent, this could be a hit.
You know who'd be great? BoJack Horseman.
(LAUGHING) Don't make me laugh, because I have a heart condition and it could kill me.
Every little thing I bring that guy, he turns down.
I think with the right project, BoJack could-Bup, bup, bup! P.
C.
, do I get you coffee and pick up your dry cleaning and buy you peek-a-boo negligees for strange women you saw at the train station once? No.
Then how about I don't do your job and you don't do my job? You know, I would like to be an agent someday.
Yeah, yeah, someday, sure.
But for now, you're learning from one of the greats.
Mark my words.
The best agent in the world couldn't get that joker off his ass.
Hmm (DOORBELL RINGS) BoJack, I brought you Four Loko.
I brought four Four Lokos.
That's 16 Lokos.
Finally someone brings me an adequate amount of Lokos.
Are you trying to get me drunk? (GROANS) You were trying to get me drunk.
Where are you taking me, what am I wearing? To a meeting, and your clothes.
Is this a fedora? What am I, Jason Mirzizzerzaz? I don't know.
You know who.
I knew you wouldn't take this meeting if I didn't trick you into it.
Cuddlywhiskers has a great script and wants to meet you.
I have a script for you.
It's called "The BoJack Says No Chronicles".
Fade in, Princess Carolyn's car.
Princess Carolyn: "Hey, BoJack, you want to do this dumbass thing?" Act break.
Act two.
BoJack turns to Princess Carolyn.
BoJack: "No, thank you.
" End of episode.
Hey! Aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? (SIGHS) You see, this is why I don't go out amongst the not-famouses.
Just do me a favor and take this meeting.
(GROANS) If you're a good boy, we can do that weird French thing you saw in that Internet video.
Ooh, parkour? This show came to me when I was in rehab.
I realized I'm only here on this earth for a bit, why not dig deeper? Huh.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm proud of the seven years I spent on Krill & Grace.
That show did so much for the way society views krill people.
That show didn't make me happy.
The awards, the money didn't make me happy.
Did you try spending the money on things? I started to feel like I was trapped in a giant plastic ball.
BoJack, meet my lovely assistant, Jill Filipowicz.
Hey.
Hi.
Did I say you could speak, wench? You can't talk to me like that.
(GRUNTS) Clean up that mess this instant! No.
I'm a dirty girl.
Uh I'm filthy.
You are being very bad.
You'll have to punish me later.
(BOTH CHUCKLING) Jill and I have a very special relationship.
Want to tell me about the show? I hear it's great.
I've worked on great shows my whole career.
Great shows are easy.
I didn't become president of the Lampoon so I could make "great" shows.
Harvard Lampoon.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm trying to do something different here.
Something that lasts.
Huh.
Think about it.
If you're ready to finally stop being "The Horse" from Horsin' Around, send me an e-mail: Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.
edu.
That's H-A-R-I got it.
(GASPS) You got some mail, babe.
Mwah! You understand I'm using that pet name ironically, right? Yes, Wayne.
Oh, my God, check it out, a rejection letter from The New Yorker.
That magazine is for white people.
White people are the worst, right, guys? Yup.
"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece, 'An Open Letter to Open Letters', wasn't right for us, despite its evident merit.
" Do you know what this means? Caring leads to disappointment? Trying is stupid and so is having dreams? Someone gave my piece a read and decided against it.
Their journalistic style couldn't be more outmoded.
Satire? More like "sa-tired.
" I never even thought they'd read it.
"Talk of the Town"? More like "Schlock of the Clown".
Then they typed me a letter that said it had "obvious merit".
"Shouts and Murmurs"? More like "Louts and" What rhymes with murmurs? For two people who don't like The New Yorker, you know a lot about the different sections of The New Yorker.
And then Cuddlywhiskers said: "What if we stopped thinking of TV as a conduit to tell stories and thinking of it as a conduit to tell truth?" And I was like: "Damn, this guy must have gone to Yale or something.
" Sounds like you two really hit it off.
We were like Heidi and Spencer up in there.
So you're gonna do the show? Nah.
Timing's really off right now.
(SIGHS) iPhone's coming out this year, I need to gear up for that.
I'm done.
That's it, I'm tired of bending over backwards for you.
I mean this in all seriousness, professionally or in bed? Why won't you do this? Give me one good reason.
Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if I'm not? What if there's a reason the only thing I'm known for is Horsin' Around? BoJack, you are amazing.
You're bright and you're funny and you're handsome and you're talented.
But if you can't see that, then you're the biggest, dumbest piece of shit in the world.
(POP MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHTER AND CHATTER) How long do we have to stay in here? It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Uh We don't have to kiss.
I know you'd rather be in here with Kimber.
That's not true.
It's just that, Emily What? I've never kissed anyone before.
That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other? That way, when you're in here with Kimber one day, you'll know exactly what to do.
Okay, so how should we do it? French style, Eskimo, Butterfly? I'll tell you.
I know exactly what to do because I practice all the time with a picture of Adam Brody-No, I don't! (CHUCKLES) Just close your eyes, and we move our faces toward each other.
Okay.
Until we (SIGHS) (MARV) Oh! Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.
You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn, guess who just got BoJack a job.
You are the secretary of a wonderful agent.
Now go pick up a pair of satin crotchless undies.
I saw a stewardess at the Yum Yum Donuts.
We did not make eye contact.
(MAN) Good morning, Los Angeles.
It's two months later in 2007.
(MAN 2) Two months later? Two months later than what? (MAN 1) Did I say two months later? Cookie chartreuse brontosaurus, I think I'm having a stroke.
Aaah! Jeez, sleep much? Jeez, watch me sleep much? Well, I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking about today's first read-through.
These things are always so nerve-wracking, to sit there and perform for all these people like some kind of a-Professional actor? Very funny.
Before I forget, I got you a present.
(GASPS) It's a box with crinkly tissue paper inside it.
How did you know? Thank you for putting this whole thing together.
Even though I still can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Promise me everything's going to be okay? I promise it's gonna be great.
If you get scared, look for me in the audience.
I'll be there the whole time, laughing and cheering louder than anyone.
Mmm Mm-mmm-mm.
"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle into the garbage.
Thud.
" "Goodbye, old friend.
" "Mitch turns off the light and closes the door as we Fade to black.
End of episode.
" Thank you.
Let's see what the suits say.
Bet they're gonna want to bland it up, make it appeal to middle America.
(GROANS) That's the worst part of America.
Other than the bottom, the top and most of the sides.
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers, what can we say? This is why you guys are the pros and we're just the schmoes.
I think what my husband is trying to say is, "Great job.
" Enough with the torture.
Don't have to feed me to finger me.
Just lay on the notes.
(LAUGHS) Our only note? No notes.
No notes? We love this show.
BoJack, I'm calling it right now.
This show is gonna be as big as Horsin' Around.
(GULPS) Huh.
And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel? You are un-Jessica-Bielievable.
" It was so funny.
Wow.
It seems like you're really in sync with this Justin guy.
You should do all the things with him that I can't do.
Like eat chocolate, or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.
Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball? Hello? Can we please get some service in this place? I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.
I'm one of the Jessicas.
Mom, I'm finally gonna be a published writer.
My "Open Letter to Open Letters" is going to be published in McSweeney's.
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish? No, Mom.
It's a very popular website.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that scam.
Website? We gotta print it out on our own paper with our own ink? I don't think so.
Mom.
And my Blockbuster original series has been keeping me very busy.
I still don't get how that's gonna work, at all.
Babe, it makes total sense.
They make the whole season, put it on six DVD's.
People go to their local Blockbuster Video and rent it out one disc at a time for five days each.
What if someone already rented the episodes they want? They can just get something else, like The Illusionist or The Prestige.
Whichever one you were in.
Do you know which one? Do you? (GROANS) Why do you say yes to everything? I get excited by the possibilities.
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop? That is crazy.
Buying it.
Eh-eh eh-eh! No.
Drop it.
Drop it.
(WHIMPERS) Good boy.
Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz! You heard what the network said.
Heard they loved it.
Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.
Exactly.
The network loved it.
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.
If you want my opinion, fellas, you hit oil, stop drilling.
"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake.
" That'll be funny in a year or so.
Before that got sad and weird, you said, "If you want my opinion," and we don't.
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me you wanted to do something different.
Now we're doing something that's gonna be "just as good as Horsin' Around.
" Is that what you wanted? That's not why I'm here.
I know.
I really think you're making a mistake.
I'm not taking career advice from somebody who's been an assistant the last 14 years.
Is that how you think of me? As your agent's assistant? What do you think you are? I don't know.
Here's some free advice: you should know.
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups? Somebody needs coffee, I'll give you a ring.
Okay, best of luck.
(CLEARS THROAT) Cuddlywhiskers, let's give ourselves one night to stick our dicks in this script and go balls deep into the universe.
I'm in.
What's that, you say? There's a panic? At the disco? I gotta go.
What do you want, Toots? I want to be an agent.
I think I'm ready.
(GROANS) Again with this "I wanna be a female agent" thing.
They don't even have a word for it.
Uh, agentess, agentrix.
It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
Okay, okay! You're an agent, all right? I dub thee agent.
You can even take my office, because I quit.
What? Who needs the headache? Thirty years I threw into this job and it destroyed me from the inside out.
I never fell in love, I never had a family.
I never even got to give that lacy teddy to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.
(SIGHS) All I have is regrets.
Oh, my God, I'm an agent! I'm gonna make it after all.
Whaah! First thing I'm gonna do is get rid of that ceiling fan.
How do we make it clear that this isn't Horsin' Around? What if in the very first scene, we show my character literally taking a massive dump on a VHS copy of Horsin' Around? What? That's insane.
Let's just put it in, we can always take it out later.
I want this character to be really edgy, the kind of character Denis Leary would be offered and then say: "This character's too edgy for me.
" What if he had a catchphrase that was an anti-catchphrase? Like if every time he entered the room he was like, "Whassup, bitches?" Not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.
Whassup, bitches? That is so dumb.
But kind of brilliant, right? Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.
This should be the show.
I haven't felt this alive since the head of the Charles Regatta.
That's a Harvard thing.
Yes.
This is brilliant.
What if we had five minutes of him reading a book to himself? Oh, my God, yes.
Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.
(BOTTLE BREAKS) The real shit, they never show that.
Wow, we did it.
We stayed up all night, but we really made something new and different and daring.
We've changed everything but the title.
Well, then, how about we give it a new title? The BoJack Horseman Show.
(GASPS) Oh, Cuddlywhiskers, I don't know what to say.
Well, then why don't you just say, "Whassup, bitches?" But, you know, not that.
Something like that.
We'll figure it out.
Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars? Let's not forget why we're here tonight.
To raise money for the John Edwards campaign.
I was talking to one of the volunteers earlier and she was just gushing about how John Edwards touched her.
I say, let's make this man president so he can touch whoever he wants.
Four hundred dollars.
I don't know what's cheesier, this three-cheese risotto or that dude's patter.
Seriously.
This fundraiser should have a fundraiser for a better host of this fundraiser.
Totes McGotes.
I'll post that to my Twitter page.
You should follow me.
I'm A with a circle around it, "insWayne in the membWayne".
(DIANE SIGHS) What's a Twitter page? (CHUCKLING) Erica, you know you're not allowed to vote in national elections.
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) You sure it's okay to be in your parents' bedroom? Todd, so we've been together for months now.
Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex? Uh We don't have to.
I don't wanna peer pressure you.
No.
I'm ready for sexual situations.
Um Hooray.
Um, taking your virginity.
Yeah, sure.
That's how I would say it.
Okay, here we-Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.
(GARAGE DOOR OPENING) Did you hear that? Oh, snap.
My dad's home early.
You gotta get out of here.
Your dad, the mobster? What? My dad's not a mobster.
You said he was like that guy from The Sopranos.
I said he works on The Sopranos.
He's an editor.
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.
He must be so desensitized to violence and nihilistic ruminations on the banality of evil.
Here, out the window.
You love shimmying, right? You know I love shimmying, but that's a two-story drop.
Use this.
Go, get out.
Go, go! Uh, okay.
Oh, shit.
(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(PANTING) Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr.
Melfi? Mamma mia! So, the island's purgatory, right? What's really happening-Hold that thought.
(GROANS) Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.
I figured since I'm your agent, I should at least show up to your premiere party.
I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.
I figured you'd call me if you needed a coffee.
Ouch.
Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.
Yeah.
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?" From now on it'll be, "You're BoJack Horseman.
" I'm happy for you, BoJack.
How about a kiss for good luck? No, BoJack.
I'm your agent and your friend, and I will always support you.
But I'm 33 years old, and I want to have a family by the time I'm 40.
I don't want to spend the next seven years in and out of love with you.
I've wasted too much time waiting for things to happen.
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.
And for what it's worth, I always liked the horse from Horsin' Around.
You did? Yeah.
Everybody did.
Unbelievable.
Un-Jessica-Bielievable.
Can we not fight while I'm at a gig? There are a lot of big producers, this could be my next big break.
(GROANS) This podunk benefit is below us.
I'm about to be in what I've been told is a very important gay rights movie, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.
I now pronounce me very impressed, but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.
As Justin would say, "Cry me a river.
" Hey, if you like Justin so much, maybe you should just continue to be really good friends with him.
Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.
Uh, I didn't say that.
I now pronounce this marriage over.
Biel with it.
(SOBBING) You wanted water? Thanks.
Wait.
Blarn, right? Yeah, from the coffee shop.
What are you doing here? Is there coffee to "bariste"? I also do cater waiter gigs to make ends meet.
You "bariste" and cater and waiter? (LAUGHS) Triple threat.
I should be bringing you the water.
You know, just for the record, I think it's cool that you put yourself out there.
A lot of guys in your position wouldn't take gigs like this.
They'd be afraid people would make fun of them.
That's dumb.
If you care about what other people think, you're never gonna do anything.
Yeah, you're right.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.
I was like, "Why did I say that? That was so dumb.
" Then you were like, "That's right.
" And I was like, "Ooh! Validation.
" Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt? Go ahead.
(GROANS) This monkey suit is killing me.
Oof! Hey there, Delilah.
Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.
Actually, my name isn't Blarn.
What? I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke to subvert the idea of co-opting personal identity to further corporate branding which, as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.
(LAUGHING) "Blarn.
" That is very funny.
You should be a writer.
Thanks.
I'm Diane.
Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Yeah, I know.
Add me on MySpace, okay? Sure.
All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.
It's Diane.
Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.
Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.
What do you mean? We premiere in two minutes.
Call the network, cancel the whole thing.
Nobody wants to see me take a dump on a Horsin' Around VHS.
BoJack, it's going to be fine.
This is what we wanted, remember? Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.
This is why I didn't want to do another TV show.
Everything was perfect.
BoJack, this shit is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
I can't promise everyone will love this show.
No matter what, people will remember it.
Five, ten years from now, this is the show people will associate you with, and you'll be glad they do.
Because this show is real, it's edgy, it's different.
A lesser talent couldn't have pulled it off.
But I'm willing to bet on BoJack Horseman.
Are you? Yes, I am.
Great.
Because the show is starting and your life is about to change forever, in three, two, one.
What happened to my birthday cake? Goober.
It wasn't me.
But you're welcome to check my pockets.
Go home, Goober.
Go home, Goober.
Oh, I was a Goober, all right.
I Goobed with the best of 'em.
But that ain't me anymore.
I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/ number one customer of Whale World.
At Whale World, families come together to admire the fine female form of the majestic killer whale.
It's educational.
Join us in the Splash Zone.
You and your little ones are gonna get moist.
Whoo-hoo! These orcas have the floppiest dorsal fins in town and they can't wait to jump through hoops for you and your kids.
Bring your prepubescent daughters, who are beginning to be cognizant of a woman's role in the world.
They won't internalize deeply problematic notions about the commodification of sexuality in today's society.
What are you talking about? It's just whales.
And what about so-called "experts," who say it's wrong to keep these girls in captivity so they can amuse and entertain us? Well, to those people I say, "Stop saying that, okay?" These sea girls are my family, and my business.
And they can be yours too.
Come on down to Whale World, a fun, sexy time for the whole family.
Hey, Jill.
Where are you? I hear mirth.
An elementary school all inclusive non-denominational winter day pageant.
Oh, no.
The snow goblin wants to destroy our seasonal festivities.
"Snow goblin" is an offensive slur.
Jesus, Jill.
And you thought your play sucked.
I didn't.
Well, regardless.
A lot of these fancy kids' fancy parents are Oscar voters.
If I wanna get nominated, I got to rub elbows and whatever the non-denominational word for schmooze is.
Hobnob.
Did you check on Cuddlywhiskers like I asked? He's doing great.
Little of this, little of that.
Likes to go jogging in a big wheel.
You didn't check on him, did you? Completely forgot.
Shh! Keep it down, buddy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you miss the three wise people make their journey to visit the regular baby? Go to his house.
If he's not there, you must retrieve something for me, something of a sensitive nature.
Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop calling me, asking me to go on errands.
What do you need? A letter I wrote him, back when we were, prepare yourself, I'm about to say lovers Lovers.
That was not enough time to prepare.
Get off the phone, jerk.
It was years ago and it was quite beautiful and disgusting all at once.
I remember it fondly.
And horribly.
What's in the letter? None of your concern.
I must have it, for sentimental reasons.
Goodbye.
Did you have a nice phone call? Are you in the Academy? No.
Then I don't care what you think.
I got to go do a thing for someone.
Fine.
You made your appearance, you were magnificent, I'm very proud.
But don't forget, you have a full day of muckety-muck glad-handing.
The Bat Mitzvah, the senior Academy member meet and greet.
You'll be wonderful, I have complete faith in you.
That is literally the first time anyone ever said that to me.
Diane, you'll keep up his Internet presence? I want him trending by this afternoon.
But good trending, not bad trending, you understand? Hashtag you betcha.
Did I just say hashtag out loud? Hashtag, oops.
Hashtag, oh no! I'm honestly more alarmed by the "you betcha".
I'll take a smoke break before these little boogers dig into the refrain of "Frosty the Non-Gendered Snow Person.
" Ugh.
Could you imagine having a kid? Eww.
I'm Terry Gross and this is your ring tone.
I'm here with novelist Jonathan Lethem.
Jonathan, how did you become a ring tone? You know, Terry, growing up in Brooklyn, I was always fascinated by ring tones and the stories they told.
Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Hello, my precious darling slice of sunshine, who I am not putting on a pedestal.
Just calling for our daily download, as per Dr.
Janet's friendly but firm suggestion.
When do you think you'll be home? Uh, it might be late.
Okay, just let me know.
I cherish you, I respect you and you have value.
I feel valued and I value you.
I am hearing that and I accept that.
Diane? Yes? Do you accept my acceptance? I hear it and I accept it and I value it and all the other verbs.
Promise you won't work too hard today? I won't, if you promise me you won't bother that skunk next door.
I don't want to come home to a stinky husband.
That is some great food for thought.
I gotta go right now.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, my favorite weekday client.
Why are you calling on the weekend? I need your help.
I've done something bad, very bad.
Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.
What? No, it's not.
Why would I-Listen, I was sniffing around where I didn't belong and I got skunked.
What? You got to help us.
Us? Todd's here too.
I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.
Skunked real bad.
Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked, super skunked.
Hardcore.
Yeah, hardcore skunked.
Okay.
First things first, don't go back in the house.
Sadly, you can call me L.
L.
Cool J because I am in the house.
Yecch! Okay, don't move.
I'll be there in 20.
Mind if I do this real quick? I gotta pick up a letter.
Can we make the appearances we're supposed to make and go home? Oh, sure.
I haven't seen you much since you moved out of my deck chairs.
You know, I've been focusing on my new job and my marriage and-And avoiding me? I'm not avoiding you.
I'm just making an effort to not be in a room alone with you because I am avoiding you.
Oh.
You know, I think we're alike in a lot of ways.
I always tell people you're like the not-cool version of me.
Sometimes that's great, but it also means we can bring out the worst in each other.
I'm trying to get my life back on track.
I just think maybe it's better, for both of us, if we keep things a little more professional.
Yes, okay.
Professional.
BoJack and Diane being professional.
Doing our jobs and nothing else.
We're at the place I needed to go to.
It's so weird I drove here on accident.
Might as well run in and grab that thing I need to get.
Then, back to business.
It's spooky in here.
Too spooky.
Really? And what would be the right amount of spooky? Jesus, this thing's heavy.
Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms got so jacked.
Put it down, BoJack.
Does it look weird? Me with an Oscar? I actually think that it feels-Oh, my God.
I think she's dead.
Hold on, maybe she's not dead.
Maybe she's just being a-a whale? No, she's dead.
Maybe there's someone in her phone we can call.
Diane, kids these days don't call.
They communicate via a combination of text messages, eye rolls, and dick pics.
Oh, my God.
What is it? Dick pics? See if they spell out a message.
Freeze! Drop the Oscar! Oh, man.
Well, well, well.
Or should I say whale, whale, whale? Killer whale, that is.
Or should I say killed whale? Listen, Officer-I told you to freeze.
You just became prime suspects in the case I like to call, "Black and White and Dead All Over, A Whale Of A Crime: An Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface Mystery.
" Eh Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.
I am a woman, sir.
Lindsay, you know I am trying.
Can we please show a united front in front of the perps? We will talk about this later.
Aww.
Ohh! It smells like a skunk skunked another skunk in here, then they smoked a joint.
What happened? First I rolled all over the couch to get the skunk stench out, but that did not work.
Then I ran into every room to rub myself on all my clothes and belongings, to get the Mr.
Peanutbutter smell back.
And then I smoked a joint, so that might be why it smells like skunk in here.
Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this before Diane gets home.
Things have been shaky with us since she pretended to be out of the country for two months.
And then when I filled our entire house with these giant crates of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.
Why buy these spaghetti strainers in the first place? Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.
Man, married life is weird.
We're making an effort and getting stronger every day, but I swear to God we are like five big fights away from a divorce, I do not want this to be one.
Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.
Is marinara all right, or will I need something zestier like Arrabiata? Tomato bath.
Whoa! I am so high right now.
Wait, was there a skunk in here? What do you know about Nadia? Uh, who's Nadia? Your friend doing the face-down mambo in the king-sized bathtub.
Now I know her name is Nadia.
Oh, so you're a comedian, huh? Although I am trying to branch into more serious roles.
You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.
Yeah, what are they? I mean, I don't know them know them.
But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick? You're not gonna look up your rights, are you? What? No.
I'm just supposed to moderate an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback on Snapchat.
Let me just set up the user preferences here, and you can't detain us unless we're under arrest.
Damn it.
You were looking up your rights, weren't you? Nope, that was just a thing I already knew.
Everyone's stupid rights these days.
I never get to have any fun.
Let's get out of here.
BoJack, I need to show you something.
This is Nadia's phone.
I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.
Check this out, the last text message she sent.
"BoJack is going to kill me?" I think someone's trying to frame you, for murder.
Oh, my God, we're gonna be late for the Bat Mitzvah.
We got to get to Brentwood.
At this time of day? It's gonna be murder.
Hey! I can't believe you're not more concerned about this.
Someone is implicating you in a murder.
I can be two things at once.
I am very concerned, but also very proud that today Tovah is a woman.
Hi, BoJack Horseman, potential Oscar nominee.
I am kvelling over here.
Real verklempt.
Shabbat shalom.
Shabbat shalom.
Shabbat shalom.
Shabbat shalom to you.
We need to figure out who's behind this.
Call Jill, find out what she knows.
Good thinking.
If I go to jail, that will throw a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.
The Academy does not look kindly on murder.
Rape, they don't seem to have a problem with.
Be careful.
Jill could be the one trying to set you up.
She did send us to the house.
Backstrom, turn it down a notch.
Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me? This is a crucial weekend for BoJack brand awareness.
What am I supposed to tweet? "Someone got murdered, we found the body.
Hashtag murder party"? No, obviously.
Bat Mitzvah in Brentwood.
Hashtag Jewish stuff.
BoJack.
Hey, Jill.
You're not trying to frame me for murder, are you? What? Can you take this seriously? Can you take this seriously? You find the letter? Check in the vent behind the water feeder.
I've been pretty tied up at Drake's cousin's Bat Mitzvah.
Did you know Drake's cousin was Jewish? I'm sorry, did I forget to hang up? Get the letter.
This is why I couldn't live in New York.
Everyone's so bossy.
Also, what's with the pizza by the slice thing? Hey, New York, either eat a pizza or don't.
I'm calling the last person Nadia was in contact with before she died.
Maybe she knows something.
Nadia? No, this is-Where you been? Boys upstairs are getting real sick of you.
Get off the phone, Skinny Gina.
You're on the clock.
I gotta go.
That man's voice sounded familiar.
Yeah, super familiar.
Something about that voice made me want to tell it to go home.
It's Goober.
Goober.
That guy never went home.
Except for that one episode "Goober Goes Home," because we were on a softball team together and the home was home plate.
They must be at Whale World.
Okay, good.
Because I absolutely want to get to the bottom of this.
Can we at least wait until after they lift the chair? That is my favorite part.
Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.
Oh, I taste delicious.
How you boys doing in there? Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.
Oh, no, the stain.
Me three.
You took your bath together? Lena Dunham takes baths with her friends and no one gives her shit.
Gotta-Gotta get dry.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, use the towel.
Do not shake.
The sauce is so sticky and wet.
Don't shake.
It's dripping all over my body.
I gotta shake! Aaah! Aah! Oh, yeah.
Oh, look, that made things worse.
Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.
You two get rid of the stinky clothes.
You got it, chief.
Hooray! Following instructions.
Ooh.
Fish half off at Beverly Hills farmers market.
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.
You're not putting emojis in, are you? BoJack don't tweet emojis.
BoJack? Oh, my God! Oh, hey you.
I haven't seen you in forever.
You came to see your old friend.
Uh, yeah.
All this time I thought you forgot about me.
Things haven't been so swell with me since the show ended.
Not like you, Mr.
Movie Star.
Okay, buddy.
Just knowing that you care about me and would come patronize my place of business, it really means a lot.
You got it, Goober.
Oh, no, I haven't been Goober for 20 years.
You can call me by my real name.
Okay, maybe I will.
Right now, call me by my real name.
I want to hear you.
Uh I want to say Goo bert.
Goobert? Oh, you didn't come to see me, did you? No, we did, but-I get it.
I'm a big joke.
"Let's all go down to Whale World and laugh at Goober.
We'll have a whale of a good time at Goober's expense.
He's always good for a laugh.
" I should've known better than to get my hopes up.
Yeah.
We're looking for one of your strippers, Skinny Gina? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't employ strippers here.
Whale World is a family establishment, where children of all ages have a fun, sexy time.
Hey, Skinny Gina, get that sweet tail over here! You got a customer.
You enjoy yourself.
Well, hello, land mammals.
We're just here to ask you some questions about your friend Nadia.
I'm on the clock.
You want to chat? Buy me a private dance in the Blowhole Room.
Oh, please.
Ugh, gross.
Private dance? But if that's the only way she'll talk, then fine.
Fine, I'm offended.
Yuck.
But really, guys, gross.
Start it now.
But gross.
Oh, um, you can dance however you want.
Don't do this for my benefit.
Tango, waltz, salsa.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.
How would you dance then? Like a stripper, probably.
Listen, we have some bad news.
Your friend Nadia is dead.
Not surprised.
You're not? A lot of girls like her come through here.
Sweet, vulnerable.
This place takes 'em and makes 'em a lot of promises.
They say they're gonna take care of you, make you big like Shamu.
But once your body gets too banged up, they don't want you no more.
Thar she blows, then thar she goes.
Shit.
Watch your mouth, lady.
There are children here.
Uh What do you know about Nadia's relationship with Cuddlywhiskers? Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.
His house has been abandoned for months, though.
That's all I know.
That's it? That's it.
A bunch of girls used to hang out.
He had some sort of system.
Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.
What do you mean, "system"? I have already said too much.
A system is a formulated method or plan of procedure.
I know what the word "system" means-But that's all I can say.
That text that Nadia sent you, "BoJack is going to kill me.
" Any idea what that's about? Hey, I don't know nothing about BoJack.
How do you not know about BoJack? I am very famous.
Time's up.
Hey, if you really want to know about all that stuff, come by here real late.
There's an after-hours party.
But that's all I can say.
I'm not gonna spill any more beans.
Say you got BoJack with you.
That'll get you in.
Okay, that's it.
Is Wilbur coming today? Wilbur's not real.
He was a character on a TV show you were on.
Oh.
Are my kids coming today? Um No.
Hey there, fella.
Can't wait for you to see Secretariat, think you're gonna love it.
Hey, old pal.
Hope you remember how to vote.
We have to go to this Whale World party.
I know I should go, I'm invested in figuring out who's trying to frame me for murder.
Are you sure you wanna go with me? Outside of work hours? I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.
Sorry about what I said.
I was embarrassed by the person I was when I was staying with you.
I'm trying not to be that person.
I make you unhappy? Is that what you're saying? It's not about being happy.
That's the thing.
I'm just trying to get through each day.
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?" It just makes me more miserable.
Can I get a photo with the star? Of course.
Oh, thank you.
I don't know if I believe in it, real lasting happiness.
All those perky, well-adjusted people you see in movies and TV shows? I don't think they exist.
No one's happy all the time.
You have to focus on the small things.
Right.
Like winning an Oscar.
Right.
Hey, old pal.
Look at this guy, still alive.
Hope your voting finger works.
What happened out here? You told us to get rid of the clothes.
Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.
They're never coming back.
You two are impossible.
Why did you even call me here? Because you're Princess Carolyn, you can fix anything.
That's true.
But you can't start a fire on your lawn.
There's a drought and-There's a drought.
You, thoughtful husband that you are, got rid of your lawn, and replaced it with drought-resistant landscaping.
This could work.
I got to make a few phone calls.
Aw, thanks.
You're the best.
I tell you, I've got half a mind to go over and give it to that skunk for starting this whole darn thing.
No.
You go inside to your spot and stay there while I fix this.
Yeah, but-Right, but, um Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Oh, my God.
Ugh.
I, uh Living the nightlife.
Hashtag feeling good about myself and my choices.
Aah! Hey, look.
Let's definitely follow that guy.
Ladies first.
What a gentleman.
Ohh.
Whoa.
Ooh.
Ohh.
Oh, my God.
I'm Terry Gross and this is your ring tone.
I'm here with-BoJack kills? Something tells me that's not a reference to your old stand-up act.
Was that necessary? What do you want? I'm with BoJack.
Yeah? Let me see.
See what? Let me see some BoJack.
Fine.
Wicka-wicka-wicka-Oh, shit.
You're BoJack! Thank you.
Finally.
From the logo.
Huh? BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.
BoJack did.
What? Nighty-night.
Wakey, wakey.
So, you got a little curious, huh? Thought you'd go sticking your little nose where it doesn't belong? What's the play here? Trying to get a cut of my smack biz? What? No, Goober.
You know my real name.
I actually seriously don't.
We just wanted to know why everyone was talking about how BoJack kills? Why would you implicate me in your drug business? Wait, I get what happened.
You resented me all these years.
My fame, your obscurity.
You made me the face of this drug, because to you my face is a symbol for the opiate of show business.
No, man.
You played The Horse.
Huh? Horse is a nickname for heroin.
What? BoJack.
Horse.
Heroin.
Uh-huh.
Uh Oh-Oh, okay.
Yeah, right.
Police! Oh, God, not again.
Gotcha! Richie Osborne, you're under arrest.
Oh, right, Reggie.
Richie.
That's what I said.
I said Rickie.
Thank God.
How did you find us? Your Twitter account is hooked up to your phone's location services.
We've been tracking you through your tweets all night.
Actually, I've been tracking you all night.
Lindsay, I said "we".
Do you need credit for everything? I would like credit for something.
What do we know? Nadia was not murdered.
She died of a heroin overdose.
No one tried to frame me.
All right, back in the Oscar race.
Look out, Jurj Clooners.
But something's still fishy about this whole mess, and it's not just the killer whales.
Whales are mammals, Diane.
I said it's not the whales.
You said it's not just the whales.
There's more to this story.
What are we missing? Cuddlywhiskers.
What was Nadia doing in his backyard in the first place? What was this "system"? And where is he now? Why was it so important to Jill to get that letter back? Oh, yeah, the letter.
This mystery has too many things.
I say we go back to the house and finally get to the bottom of what's what.
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.
A real Jill Pill jail fail killer whale caper.
You're doing 50 in a 35.
Oh, God, you're right.
I feel so alive.
This letter is really graphic.
It's all about their magical nights up at the Ojai property.
Ojai property? She wrote out the sounds.
What is a "sploink"? Did you know Cuddlywhiskers had an Ojai property? Sure.
He always loved to disappear up there.
After our show got canceled, he went there for six months.
It's funny, at the time no one knew where he was and we got really worried.
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.
Oh, you know what? I don't see him.
Do you? Huh.
I'm Terry Gross and this your ring tone.
Shit.
Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Diane, where the hell are you? Ojai.
Oh, hi? You've been gone all night, all you have to say is "Oh, hi?" I'm so sorry.
BoJack and I were trying to find a killer and-Oh, you're with BoJack still? Well, that explains it.
Of course.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I understand and affirm your feeling-I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried about you.
What I'm hearing you say is you were-No, stop.
You have to call me.
It doesn't matter what's happening, doesn't matter if it's the middle of the night.
You can't keep doing this to me.
I'm sorry.
I'm coming home.
I'm going back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.
Everything okay? No.
Sorry.
It's not your fault.
It's my fault.
BoJack? Mmm.
After The BoJack Horseman Show fell apart, I got depressed a long time.
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies, I made a ton of money, but it wasn't fulfilling.
I remember when I won my Oscar, standing up on that stage, looking at the statue and thought, "This is supposed to be the happiest moment of my life.
" And I never felt more miserable.
Oh.
Because you're sober? Because an Oscar is meaningless.
It's all meaningless.
I dedicated myself to helping others.
I turned my home into a halfway house for troubled addicts.
I had this system for recovery, and it helped a lot of them, but even more slipped through the cracks.
That, too, left me empty.
Everyone was worried about you, you know.
You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.
Sometimes you need to take responsibility for your own happiness.
You don't think that's a little selfish? I don't know what to tell you.
I'm happy, for the first time in my life.
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.
It takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are, even longer to see it doesn't have to be that way.
Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy.
Can you believe that guy? What a nut, right? I just wanna go home.
Why do I have to go to this thing? If we want to be a legitimate awards contender, Secretariat needs to make an appearance at a big festival.
-I can't just go to Cannes? -You Cannes not.
Apparently, the French do not care for you ever since you said that thing in the press.
Hey, I stand by my critique of Sartre.
His philosophical arguments helped tyrannical regimes justify overt cruelty.
Also, the French smell and I hate them.
And you can't go to Sundance because Robert Redford hates you.
Someone had to tell him The Horse Whisperer was offensive.
Sorry, but real horses don't just do whatever someone says.
And that's why you need to go to this festival.
(SIGHS) If you say so.
The Pacific Ocean Film Fest, or POFF, is the biggest underwater film festival in the world.
You make a splash there, people are going to notice.
Fine.
All you need to do is get to the premiere on time, 8:00.
Walk the red carpet, wave at the crowd, kiss some fish babies.
(GROANS) Fish.
They're so annoying.
-(SQUEAKING) -Sorry, lady.
No habla fish talk.
You need to be sensitive to their culture.
Things are different down there.
You know what a thumb's up means, right? Yes, I know what a thumb's up means.
I'll be fine.
Oh, I wanted to warn you.
Kelsey Jannings is also going to be at the festival.
-Kelsey? No.
-She has another film there.
I haven't talked to her since she got fired from Secretariat.
Well, luckily you won't have to talk much because you'll both be underwater.
God, I haven't been underwater since my mother tried to drown me in the bathtub when I was 22.
I can't do this, Ana.
I'm sorry.
-Sir.
-I'm getting off.
You can't.
We've already pressurized the cabin.
-Sir, please return to your seat.
-No.
I don't want to do this.
You can't make me.
I'm a land creature.
I don't belong down there.
You can lead me to water, but you cannot make--
-Hey, move it, buddy.
-What are you, deaf? 
-Oh, you have got to be kidding-
Hey, buddy, big day.
(MOANS) No.
Big premiere day.
Stop.
Secretariat in theaters now.
How exciting.
Please stop.
People are seeing your movie, forming opinions, judging you, all over the country.
What are you doing? Or not.
Maybe nobody's seeing it.
Wouldn't it be weird if literally nobody saw your movie? How do I get out of this conversation? JUST THINK: by this time tomorrow, we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.
The air crackles with possibilities.
Oh, good lord.
(GROANING) Uh-oh.
It's all over.
My career is gone.
I'm sure it's going to be fine.
Wasn't Secretariat a big hit at the Pacific Ocean Film Festival? Critics called it, "Gurgle glub glub blub blub.
" Festivals don't matter, Todd.
It's so you can get some leaves on your poster.
But this is the real world now.
If this doesn't hit big this weekend It's Oh! Oh, God.
(GASPS) Oh, no! BoJack, it's gonna be okay.
(PHONE RINGING) (GASPS AND MOANS) BoJack, the East Coast box office is in.
Secretariat is, wait for it a huge success! Why would you make me wait for it? That was a terrible time for a "wait for it.
" Do you know what this means? You're no longer just some TV actor they threw into a movie, you're a bona fide movie wait for it, star.
BoJack, how do you feel? Awesome.
(FUNKY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) We defy odds, we face challenges with valor, and we never give in.
For those reasons, and many more, our love is like the team that inspired the movie Cool Runnings.
If I may borrow that film's promotional tag line, "Jamaican Bobsledders?" That's right, Diane.
"Jamaican bobsledders.
" Thank you, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Thank you, Dr.
Janet, for Jamaican me open up like that.
That took up most of the hour, but we do still have a little time to hear from Diane.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I think you are great.
Is that all? I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at using words to describe emotions.
Aren't you a writer? Writer/social media coordinator/ director of New Media Outreach.
(ALARM BLARING) Aah! That gentle sound tells us the sun has set on our time together this week.
But I remind you of the importance of communication.
It's the very blade of the bobsled.
I'm not singling out either one of you, but I think for the next time, some people here might want to work on putting their thoughts and feelings into words, as a writer does.
Mmm? Mm-mmm.
Ah.
(SIGHS) I settled on a company dental plan.
It's called, "The tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth.
" Seemed comprehensive.
Not "tooth" shabby, Judah.
(LAUGHING) Yes.
I also wanted to talk to you, if this is a good time, and it is, because you have exactly nine minutes before your meeting on Captain Hooker 2: Yo Ho Ho Ho and A Bottle Of Booty.
Yeah, what's up? I've taken on duties beyond the scope of my original contract.
I think I've proven my worth.
Are you asking for a raise? A more elegant solution might involve an ownership position in the company.
I thought I'd ask for 15 percent stake, you'd counter with five, we'd settle on ten.
Well, then, it's settled.
I'll draw up the paperwork.
Speaking of paper, Piper Perabo and Pauley Perrette need to push back the pitch on the Princess and the Pauper project.
You have a night off tonight.
A night off? When's the last time that happened? It hasn't.
Can I help you with anything else? Get me a date for tonight.
Make that three dates.
Who knows when I'll get another night off? I do.
And you won't.
(SIGHS) Excuse me, my good man.
My movie, starring me, the movie star, just opened.
We'd like to sit at the bar.
Drinks on the house.
Of course, Mr.
Horseman.
Right away, Mr.
Horseman.
(CLEARS THROAT) Mr.
Sutherland, I'm going to have to ask you to give up your seat for a movie star and his companion.
Yeah.
Beat it, Kiefer.
(SCOFFS) Wow! They love you here.
Everybody loves a movie star, Todd.
I'm gonna get a lot of love.
I want you by my side, soaking up the spillover and feasting on my discarded leftovers.
Sounds great, Boj.
Tonight, we're riding a rocket straight into the sun.
You won't get left on the launchpad just because nobody knows your name.
Todd? Todd Chavez? I think you mean BoJack.
BoJack Horseman.
Emily.
No, BoJack.
Why do people keep saying names that aren't my name? I haven't seen you since high school.
You look great.
I love the hat.
Thanks.
What brings you here? My dumb best friend's getting married, so I'm here for the rehearsal dinner.
Why is everybody not talking about me for a moment? This is concerning.
Oh, my God.
You're BoJack Horseman.
Yeah, duh.
I loved The BoJack Horseman Show.
That is, like, my favorite show.
You mean Horsin' Around? No, The BoJack Horseman Show.
It was so dumb.
It was the best.
Thank you? I mean, it was the worst.
But that's what made it so good.
Yeah, I got it.
I was laughing at it because it was so bad, do you understand? You're being very clear.
I feel like I'm not articulating.
My enjoyment didn't come from a place of sincere admiration.
It was more like, "What an ill-conceived television show.
Who made those terrible choices? I can't stop watching.
" You don't have to keep Anyway, I'm pretty much in love with you.
Thanks.
I love you.
By which I mean, you're terrible.
I should get back to this stupid rehearsal dinner.
Todd, it was really great to see you.
Wait, did you say there's a wedding? I said "rehearsal dinner," but Whoa! We gotta crash that.
Boring regular people love it when movie stars show up and drink their alcohol.
They jizz their pants for that shit.
I don't know, BoJack.
I'm sorry, Todd.
Are you a movie star? I did narrate a Mazda commercial.
Funny story how that came together.
This is not the time for one of your weird stories that go nowhere.
We've got a wedding to crash.
It's a rehearsal dinner.
It just doesn't come easy for me, like it does for you.
Communication is a process.
That's why we're going to Dr.
Janet.
That, and there was a Groupon.
You had a model growing up.
You had a house filled with love, parents who said nice things to you, and the beautiful verdant hillsides of the Labrador Peninsula.
I didn't have Diane Peninsula.
I had the Isthmus of Assholes.
I keep telling you we should go visit the old country.
You'd love it up there.
There's so much to smell.
(CHUCKLES) That's weird.
I just got a text from Alexi Brosefino.
The famous movie star and man about town? He wants me to come to his house and party with his friends.
The Snatch Batch? Alexi Brosefino wants you to party with the Snatch Batch? He's one of our clients.
I met him a couple weeks ago.
We talked about me Instagramming one of his parties.
I didn't think he actually wanted me to do it tonight.
Oh, wait.
Tonight? I hoped we could snuggle up on the couch and watch Bones.
I don't think that show's about what you think it's about.
Besides, I have to go.
It's for work.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
But you'll call me if you're out late, right? Yes.
I'll call you.
Okay.
Have a good time.
Ugh! I'm sure I won't.
Cool guys like that take me back to high school and I end up feeling like a huge nerd over again.
The only kind of nerd you should feel like is hon-nerd that he selected you.
Princess Carolyn, I made reservations for you tonight at Elefante.
Reservations? For your dates.
One at seven, one at 8:30, and one at ten.
You actually got me three dates? I was joking.
I'm sorry.
I sometimes have trouble reading tone.
Once I spent 45 minutes at a fascinating lecture at the Apollo Theater before I realized it was a comedy routine.
I can't go on three dates.
Can we reschedule two of them? It will be a long time before you get another night off.
Especially since you have those lawyers coming next week to change light bulbs.
Okay, I just realized now that was also a joke.
As the father of one of the brides, I just wanted to take a moment to Buenas noches, amigos.
Let's get blasted.
Right? Oh, my God, BoJack Horseman.
The movie star.
This is the happiest day of my life.
(CHEERING) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Ooh.
(DOORBELL RINGS) Can I help you? I'm Diane.
Um I work for Princess Carolyn.
You texted me to come hang out with you and your friends.
I'm running out of things to say.
Oh, yeah.
Diane.
Yeah, no, of course.
Come in, please.
Holy shit.
Is that a Klimt? Hey, guys, we got a guest.
Diane, this is Carlos, David, and Shitshow.
Yo.
Word.
Ah, the famous Snatch Batch.
That's just a dumb name some reporter came up with.
We don't actually call ourselves that.
We all have sex with a lot of women.
But who cares? We also love getting brunch.
You might as well call us the Brunch Batch.
Or the Brunch Bunch.
Oh, my God, Carlos, that's why you're the funny one.
That is really good.
Write that one down.
Yeah, we get why the Casanova narrative is appealing and how it helps our brand.
We're not complete idiots.
Yeah, except for Shitshow.
(BLOWS RASPBERRY) (LAUGHING) Good one.
But within each man lives a great multiplicity, right? Nobody is just one thing.
Yeah, except for Shitshow, right? (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Ah You know, we can make fun of him because, like, he's our friend.
I am so sorry, Shitshow.
But the modern era of automotive glass began when engineers took two panes of laminated glass and separated them with a thin layer of PVB.
Uh-huh.
How about you? Are you in the industry? Yes, actually.
I'm an agent.
Agent? Oh, you're in the entertainment industry.
When I said the industry, I meant the auto glass industry.
We call our business the industry because we think we're more important than everybody else.
(SIGHS) (WHISTLES) I could bore everyone to death about how proud I am of the woman Taneisha's become, but rather than read the remarks I've been preparing for the last eight months, I'm gonna turn the microphone over to an honest to God movie star, BoJack Horseman, ladies and gentlemen.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Thank you, thank you.
Let's get to the reason we're here.
And no, Uncle George, I don't mean the chocolate fountain.
(LAUGHTER) You know, I don't know Karen and Taneisha super well, but I do know how precious and rare it is to find that one missing puzzle piece who completes you.
And when you know, you know.
You know? So congrats to the happy couple for knowing.
Okay, as they say in the movie business, "That's a wrap on BoJack.
" Let's hear it from some of these bridesmaids.
Taneisha, Karen.
(SING-SONG) Taneisha Karen On the way here, the driver stopped in some weird parking lot and asked if he could touch my hair.
That's terrifying.
I know.
It is a very popular ride-sharing app, you'd think they could vet their drivers better.
Which app is that? I probably shouldn't say, for legal reasons.
I think we all know which one I'm talking about.
You know what would solve a lot of problems? If there was a ride-share app for women that only had women drivers.
That is such a good idea, Todd.
You always did have such great ideas.
You know what else would be cool? A miniature cupcake gun, so you could shoot tiny cupcakes into your mouth.
"Uh-oh! Is that guy trying to kill himself?" "Nope, just a cupcake gun.
" Wait, no, go back to your other idea.
Which one? The one about the women drivers.
Taneisha, and Karen.
(SOBBING) Karen and Taneisha.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) And my foundation focuses on clean water initiatives and that's actually how I met Carlos.
He patented a process for ionic remineralization.
It's crazy.
That's incredible.
Okay, enough shop talk.
Let's roll.
Diane? Oh, drug taking.
That's cool.
I'm cool.
What is this, Molly? (LAUGHTER) Yeah, Diane, some drug dealer from 2013 found a time machine and gave us this Molly.
Nobody does Molly anymore.
This is Gush.
What's Gush? (CHUCKLES) Look, Diane, I get that this is maybe not your usual scene.
So don't feel like you have to do any No, no, I can hang.
Let's do drugs.
Let's put the drug in my mouth, so I can trip or roll or gush or (GULPING) Oh, you all did it.
Uh Here we go.
Oh, it doesn't hit right away, does it? No, it'll take a few minutes.
Okay.
So how'd you guys meet Shitshow? We went to his TED Talk.
Oh, it is so great to finally date a woman my age.
Yes.
Who's comfortable in her own skin.
I always say, there's more than one way for a cat you know, to have skin.
And has come to terms with not having children.
What makes you think I don't want to have children? Oh, come on.
What are you, serious? At your age? Since when are you an expert on who can and cannot have children? I'm a gynecologist.
I specialize in fertility.
I'd be happy to put you in the stirrups, look at the old cat eggs.
Ecch! Not if you were the last albino rhino gyno on the planet.
I'm the only albino rhino gyno I know.
Should we get some wine? Oh, great.
You're also a wine addict.
Oh, yeah! So to do a soft launch, I think we'd only need about ten cars.
I could work out any bugs with the app.
You really know what you're talking about.
So, do you think your girlfriend would get jealous if we started this project together, or Oh, God, this is so embarrassing for you, but I actually don't have a girlfriend.
That's a really weird assumption for you to make.
You look really dumb right now.
No, actually, I was kind of hoping you weren't seeing anybody.
I'm also not seeing anybody, for what it's worth.
Ohh.
Hey, Todd, you must be a real cool dude if a movie star wants to hang out with you for no reason.
Just wanted to give you a key to the room I booked, which nobody is in right now.
Winkity dinkity.
BoJack.
Maybe you two should just go see if the bed works.
A lot of these rooms have faulty beds.
That's a great idea.
Uh, yeah.
Okay, let me just finish this cocktail real quick.
(SLURPING) Uh All right, Todd.
Yeah, go.
Ahh! Cool, I'm just gonna get one or two more drinks and then we'll go check out that bed.
(EMILY) Okay.
Um hello, everybody.
I was thinking about what BoJack said before.
About how when you know, you know.
And I'm sitting there, and I'm thinking, "Do I know?" Uh I mean, I think I know.
But if you know when you know and I only think that I know, maybe that means that I don't know, right? Oh, boy.
Karen, I'm sorry.
I love you, but I can't do this.
The wedding's off.
(GASPING) (EMILY) It's a rehearsal dinner.
Thank you, BoJack.
(MIC FEEDBACK) (SOBBING) Uh I don't think it's working.
Am I doing this wrong? Am I doing drugs wrong? Alexi, did you hear back from that piece you texted? Mm-mmm! Mm-mmm.
"That piece"? That girl was hot.
What was her name again? Doesn't matter.
I mean, let's just enjoy ourselves, right? Diane? What? No, the hot girl.
Her name was Diane.
You saved her in your phone as Cool Sexy Diane.
Let's just, like, drop it, now.
That's funny.
You have two friends named Diane.
You know, I also know Diane Lane.
So, there's that.
Why are we talking about other Dianes? Hey, wouldn't it be funny if you tried to text Cool Sexy Diane, but then instead you texted Regular Boring Diane by mistake? And then I showed up and you were like, "Who's this chick?" All night, I'd be hanging out with you, thinking I was one of the gang, but it was just a big mistake because you meant to text Oh, shit, that's exactly what happened.
Wait, Diane, please hear me out (VOICE DEEPENS AND DISTORTS) Whoa.
(LAUGHTER, DISTORTED) Oh, shit.
It's hitting.
I gotta go.
(PANTING) Diane, wait.
Come on.
I get it, okay? You're the cool kids.
I'm the nerd.
I should have known.
So I texted the wrong person.
So what? This isn't high school.
There's no nerds and no cool kids.
We're all adults.
We're hanging out together and having a good time.
So just come back inside.
Everyone knows I don't belong there.
Hey, you belong wherever you want to belong, Diane.
Yeah? Yeah, look at me.
I'm a handsome white guy and I never feel like I don't belong.
Also, you took a shit ton of gush.
Things are about to get insane.
I just took one pill.
Yeah, that's a shit ton.
My jeans feel amazing right now.
That is great.
I feel so much love.
I got to tell someone.
Yes, yes, tell me.
I'm in this with you, Diane.
No.
I got to go home.
I got to tell my husband.
(SIGHS) Wait, Diane.
That tree is amazing.
Ugh! (SHUDDERS) Princess Carolyn? You've got to be kidding me.
You're a cat.
And you're a mouse.
I think I know how this ends.
(BOTH CHUCKLING) Let's not waste each other's time and cut right to the chase.
It was nice to meet you, uh? Ralph Stilton.
It was nice to meet you.
May all your disasters be this easy to avoid.
(CHUCKLING) If I have one more bad date Oh! I am right there with you.
Date canceled.
I could use a bite to eat, though.
There's this great place around the corner.
It's a little hole in the wall, but they do a nice cheese plate.
Hmm.
(SOBBING AND SNIFFLING) (HOWLING) Wow.
Weird turn of events, huh? Nobody's fault, right? I'm gonna jet.
You need to talk some sense into my daughter.
Yeah, talking sense into people isn't really my thing.
In fact, I'm better at the opposite.
I once got Nic Cage to buy Charlie Chaplin's mustache on eBay.
That was his last ten bucks.
Please, BoJack.
She'll listen to you.
Everyone loves the movie star.
(GROANS) Uh hey, laundry cart.
Want to hide in sheets and pretend we're ghosts? No, Todd, I don't want to pretend like we're ghosts.
I want to go in the hotel room and fool around.
Do you? (CHUCKLES) I don't know, Emily.
Uh, you're pretty drunk.
No, I'm I'm not.
I'm not drunk at all.
Oh, well, I'm pretty drunk.
Yeah, but it seems like you're Maybe I should just go to bed.
I'm, uh, I'm feeling kind of sick.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
But, hey, it was really great seeing you.
Yeah, it was great seeing you too.
Yeah, yeah, good night.
(SIGHS) What? (LAUGHING) My arm is stuck in the trap and I'm running around the kitchen like crazy, smearing blood everywhere.
Oh, this is me.
(ALARM CHIRPS) I think as far as disasters go, that was one of the better ones.
It's the best non-date I've ever had.
Yeah, I was thinking, maybe some time we should have a What's the opposite of a non-date? A date.
That's the word.
I'd like that.
Well, great, great.
(CHUCKLES) When can I see you again? When's your next night off? Oh.
Did I say something? Is it because I asked for the glass of milk? If you give me a cookie No, you're great.
It's just running an agency doesn't give me a lot of nights off.
Tell you what, here's my card.
If you're ever free, give me a call.
If not, I'll just meet somebody else and invite you to the wedding.
Oh, thanks.
You don't have to come, but send a gift.
Hey, Taneisha? (SNIFFLING) BoJack? I was thinking about what you said Stop doing that.
Nobody should be thinking about the things I say.
I love Karen.
But does she complete me? Taneisha, nobody completes anybody.
That's not a real thing.
If you're lucky enough to find someone you can halfway tolerate, sink your nails in and don't let go, no matter what.
So, what, I should just settle? Yes, thank you, exactly.
Settle.
Because otherwise you're just gonna get older, and harder, and more alone.
And you're gonna do everything you can to fill that hole, with friends, and your career, and meaningless sex, but the hole doesn't get filled.
One day, you're gonna look around and you're going to realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you.
And that is the loneliest feeling in the world.
(DOOR LATCH CLICKS) The wedding is back on.
(CHEERING) I love you, baby.
I always knew I did.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Yeah.
(BRENNAN) Sometimes, the only way to solve a crime is with bones.
(CHUCKLING) (MAN) Hey, if you love bones so much, maybe we should just call you "Bones.
" (GIGGLING) Bones.
(BRENNAN) To the Bones Mobile.
(PANTING) Mr.
Peabut Nutter.
Mr.
Peeper Number.
Diane? Are you okay? (SHUSHING) The drugs have something to say.
And even though they are drugs, they come from science, so let's give a listen.
Okay.
I know I don't always have the right words, I don't always have the right feelings, but I love you so much and I need you to know that.
Yeah, I know.
And sometimes I think that I know myself, but maybe that's a trap.
Because maybe I am Cool Sexy Diane, or Really In Touch With Her Feelings Diane.
Or possibly other Dianes we don't even know about yet.
The point is, I'm all of the Dianes.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
I love that you do crazy things that make no sense, like fill our house up with spaghetti strainers.
I had a very good reason for that, but I do not remember what it was.
And we're really good for each other.
Or at least, you're good for me.
And you're fun.
And you're sweet.
And I love you.
And I need you.
And I don't always know how to tell you that.
But drugs help.
That's right, honey.
Drugs are great.
And now, I'm going to carry my man to bed.
Here we go.
Oh, okay.
(GRUNTING AND STRAINING) Uh, is this a good idea? The drugs want me to do this, and that means it's a good idea.
Aaah! (GRUNTS) Ohh! Ow! Drugs, I thought we were friends.
Oh.
Why were you working in the dark? Oh, I guess it got dark.
I didn't notice.
How were your dates? (SIGHS) Pointless.
Yes, most dates are.
Well, I've prepared our agreement.
Look it over, sign it at your leisure.
I don't have any leisure.
While you're signing, I have a stack of holiday cards for the staff.
I took the liberty of writing little personal messages to everyone on your behalf.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
Hey.
What's gonna happen tomorrow? I don't know.
Are we going to fight? No.
We are.
Drugs are gonna wear off and I'm gonna be mean.
Why am I so mean? You're not mean.
(EXHALES) (GASPS) Let's go to the Labrador Peninsula.
Yeah? Spend New Year's with your family.
Oh, you are gonna love it up there.
I have an uncle who still plays the flute at the local pub every week.
I want to hear him.
Ohh, you can't.
He plays in dog frequency.
Aww.
Well, your blood work looks good.
So go home.
Oh, and, uh, lay off the drugs.
Especially now.
Why especially now? Oh, don't worry.
Your baby's fine.
What do you mean "baby"? Why do you say "baby"? Do you not know? You're pregnant.
Motherf
fucker! So, we have some options.
Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.
You know I love you.
That's not what this is about.
We always agreed we didn't want kids, unless A streetwise but soulful teen needed somewhere to live as he waited for his Juilliard audition.
We'd support his dancing and let him stay in the guest room, right.
But a baby? Are you? It's not about me.
There's no "I" in uterus, there's only "us.
" And "U," and another "U," but that's the "U" that's in "us," so I already said that "U.
" The point is, I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.
Two hundred and forty-seven percent, that's how "there for you" I'll be.
Whatever you decide What we decide, because this is Definitely.
This is a conversation.
Let's both say what we want at the same time on three.
Okay.
One, two On three or after three? How could I say it "on three"? I'll be saying "three.
" Okay.
Okay.
One, two, three Abortion.
Get an abortion.
Oh, no.
We said different things.
The Oscar race is heating up, and all the hot stars came out to sizzle at the Golden Snowflake Awards.
Step one on the 48 awards show gauntlet that is The Exhausting Road To Oscar.
The nominees for best actor in a motion picture or Vine are Mitt Dermon for Midnight Hole Bread Poot for City Of AIDS Lernernerner DiCarpricorn for The Haberdasher's Peanut Jurj Clooners for The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee and BoJack Horseman for Secretariat.
Oh, my God.
And the Golden Snowflake is Jurj Clooners.
Oh, my goodness.
You have to be kidding me.
Don't worry, they'll call your name next time.
My clients have won Oscars nine out of the last ten years.
Nine out of ten? If you were an airline and landed nine out of ten planes, you wouldn't exactly brag about that in your commercial.
Everyone loves Secretariat.
Your time will come.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go tell A.
O.
Scott how great you are.
Hey, yo, Scott! Hey, Diane.
Diane, Diane, Diane.
I'm doing my job, BoJack.
Young people and their phones.
There could be a beautiful rainbow in this room right now and you would have no idea.
Really makes you think, huh? Can you look at rainbows on your phone? Shut up, BoJack.
Shit.
I just tweeted "Shut up, BoJack," as Cynthia Nixon.
I'd buy it.
She is not a fan, and for good reason.
We were up in the Poconos, she and I BoJack, not now.
What's up your butt tonight? You really wanna know? I would seriously like to know what crawled up your butt, made a home for itself in your butt, started a family, lived a fruitful life, and then died up your butt.
I'm getting an abortion.
Whoa, that takes me back.
I had more than my share of abortions in the '90s.
I didn't get them, I paid for them.
I really hope all those women actually got the abortions, and didn't just keep my money.
Diane, are you tweeting for pop starlet Sextina Aquafina right now? I'm trying to.
Why? Because her account just tweeted out to 40 million followers, "I'm getting an abortion.
" What? No She Oh, balls.
The tweet heard round the world.
Sextina Aquafina says, "I'm getting an abortion.
" And the world says, "Whaaa?" If it's happening, we're gonna talk about it.
It's time for Tom's Rant.
Is Twitter an appropriate forum to be discussing a sensitive issue like abortion? Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere? Wait, does that say "Tom Srant"? Why does that say Tom Srant? I clearly said Randy, don't look at Jessica.
This is on you.
Diane, VIM is hanging on by a thread and only barely scraping by because of clients like Sextina.
Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger on the Big Bear condo.
Great investment.
We are not on the edge of complete ruin.
We are on the edge of complete ruin.
I think if I explain it to her and apologize, she'll understand.
Because she's so understanding? This is a teenage pop star.
Literally the two least compassionate entities combined into the supernova of not understanding that is Sextina Aquafina.
Ugh.
So imagine my surprise when I'm in the middle of a performance for Gaddafi's cousin on his yacht and I'm in a giant champagne flute singing "Left Titty" and everyone starts to look at their phones and look at me, because I am apparently aborting a baby I do not have.
So I had them turn their boat into a car and drive me here to fire someone.
I think that's me.
Great.
You're fired, Glasses.
I'll put out a statement explaining the whole mess.
I am so sorry.
Oh.
Oh! What "oh?" Who said you could "Oh?" Taylor Swift just tweeted that you were "brave.
" Nicki Minaj tweeted at you a face with heart eyes.
And BuzzFeed just posted a list of top 15 celebrities who should have had abortions like Sextina.
You're trending like crazy.
I'm trending? Most women who go through this never talk about it because it's so stigmatized.
The fact that you're coming out like this is huge.
It would be, if you were actually getting an abortion.
So what you're saying is, maybe I am getting an abortion? Well, no, because you're not.
Yeah, but if you did, this would make you a cultural icon.
Glasses, you're un-fired.
I'm getting an abortion.
Well I gotta go on talk shows.
If I can make one woman feel a little less alone, then it's all worth it, right? Yeah And if I can make a million women buy my album, then it's definitely all worth it.
Um Diane, take the yes.
Okay.
Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face of the pro-choice movement.
Now let's get you informed.
Hey! Uh, what? So, before the procedure, you'll need to look at an ultrasound and listen to the heartbeat.
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.
Why does she have to listen to the heartbeat? It's the law.
Also, by law, I have to tell you that at one month, your puppies have a favorite color and that color may be blue.
That can't be true.
By law, I have to tell you that.
Also, before your procedure, you'll need to watch 20 hours of cute puppy videos as Sarah McLachlan's "I Will Remember You" plays softly.
Don't worry, Diane, I will watch the cute puppy videos for you.
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
No, she has to watch the videos.
Don't worry, Diane, we will watch the cute puppy videos together.
No, she has to watch them alone.
Diane, I have some terrible news.
Tomorrow, our exclusive interview with the irrepressible provocateuse Sextina Aquafina.
But first, one thing that isn't the road to Oscar.
Tonight, the Leonard Maltin Awards.
Handing out trophies to all the performances this year that Leonard Maltin thought were pretty good.
And the Malty for Pretty Good Actor goes to Bread Poot.
Whoo! You need another drink? Why? Because I lost, I'm a loser, so I have to drown my sorrows in scotch? No, I just meant because of thirst.
I could use a scotch.
Oh, look.
Jurj Clooners.
There he is, Jurj Clooners.
Hey, how are you? Thank you.
Jurj sucks.
What does everyone love about him? He's not a god.
He's just an old guy who loves pranks.
Sure sounds like God.
Jurj, hey, man.
BoJack, right? Yeah, good to see you.
Hey, Jurj, my name's Todd, and my friend Keith sleeps on your couch.
Oh, you know Keith? Tell him to clean up his shit.
Oh.
That is so Keith.
Todd, why don't you do the grown-ups a favor and go find your own shadow? It was here a second ago.
Jurj, I loved you in The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.
How do you get in the head of a war criminal? You know, I don't think of him as a war criminal.
I just think of him as a person who had a funny accent.
Totally.
I think I'm getting the hang of all this now.
You won last night, the other guy won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.
Yikes.
Look, man, you're not gonna be next.
This will sound dumb coming out of my mouth, but it's true.
So Jurj, Bread, Mitt, those are names.
Like real names.
Lernernerner DiCarpricorn, that's a name.
BoJack, not a name.
Huh.
I figured they would, like, tell you this stuff.
You're the Fifth Man.
You get it, right? Well Yeah, you get it.
Put her there.
Oh! Joy buzzer.
You just got Jurjed! All right, I'll see you later.
Vivica.
Now I know why they call you A.
Fox.
Excuse me, you gonna stay here long? We got the OCD Image Awards tomorrow, and those guys really like a clean afterparty.
So, let me get this straight, Sextina.
Someone put a baby in your belly and now you're like, "Awooga! Is there an undo button around here? Leggo my preggo.
" Is that right? That is exactly correct, A Ryan, but I am very excited for this opportunity to put a face on this important issue.
One out of three women will have an abortion in her life.
That sounds crazy high to me, I don't buy it.
I wanted to destigmatize the experience for all women out there, so I'm dropping a new single.
What? Surprise! New single? Just relax.
Crack an egg on your head, feel the yolk drip down.
America, get your uteruses turnt, 'cause this song is called "Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus.
" Oh, dear.
I'm a baby killer Baby killing makes me horny Alien's inside me I'm gonna squash it like Sigourney No, stop.
Get that fetus, kill that fetus Brrap brrap pew pew Christ, stop the tape.
Glasses, you did this.
You empowered me to tell my story.
I think the tone might be a little severe? Look, when you get an abortion, you can express yourself however you want, but this is about my body and my choices, and my choice is to be a totally insane badass.
Ugh! I am getting an abortion.
You're not even really pregnant.
So? This is show business.
"Brrap brrap.
Pew pew.
" "Brrap brrap.
Pew pew.
" A daring battle cry from the self-appointed New Voice of Choice.
But has the concept of women having choices gone too far? We've assembled this diverse panel of white men in bow ties to talk about abortion.
Gentlemen? Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.
I'm a man, but if I got pregnant, would I put my life on hold for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.
I can say that with confidence, because I will never have to make that decision, so I'm unbiased.
Does this video glamorize abortion? Very possibly, Tom.
Millennials today think everything is NBD.
NBD of course stands for No BD, referring to B.
D.
Wong, who teens think is a very big deal.
So if something's not BD, it means it's not a big deal.
These days, abortions are not BD.
Are abortions even necessary? I heard a theory that if a woman really has an unwanted pregnancy, the body has a way to break the fetus down into gas particles and then she can just fart it out.
Where did you hear this intriguing "fart it out" theory? I don't remember.
Maybe the Bible? Thank you for clarifying.
Next up, Jurj Clooners is making audiences cry in his new film, but his latest prank might make you think? Jurj.
He likes pranks, huh? I'll prank him.
I'll prank him real good.
We'll need to draw him out.
What do A-list actors like? Stretch limos? Nannies? Flying their private jets to disaster areas so they can "help out"? Yeah, limos.
We'll get a limo.
I'll need one of those caps, I'll be the driver.
I'll pick him up, and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck," and then I'll be all, "Surprise," and hit him with a bat.
Pranked! It really doesn't seem like a prank as much as you hitting him with a bat.
Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose to show how stupid pranks are.
That's the point.
Is that the point? I'm working on levels here, man.
To the limousine repository.
Good afternoon, Mr.
Clooners.
Hey, man, just one sec, my publicist is right behind me.
Of course.
Bring the publicist.
Oh, shit.
What's that, driver? I said, "Auschwitz.
" You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.
Right, well, anyway, we're going to the AOL-Time-Warner-PepsiCo-Viacom Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-Trader Joe's Auditorium for the Image Choice Spirit Awards.
Uh okay, yes, ma'am.
Here I go.
Driving, driving.
You don't need to talk, you can just drive.
Actually, can we make a couple stops? I am totally out of toilet paper, so if you could find a Rite Aid.
You have to go in and buy the TP for me.
I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.
Just pick out something extra soft for my tushy.
I don't know Do as he says, driver.
Chop chop.
Okay.
My concern is that you're actually giving the pro-life movement something to latch onto as an example of Oh, my God, you are so boring.
Can I abort talking to you right now? Abort.
You need to stop and think Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me? I am just here for emotional support.
Can you let it go? I don't want to have to ask you again.
I really think we have the chance to say something here, and all we're saying is "Pshew pshew pow.
" What is that? What are you doing? That's the gun sounds, from the song.
Uh.
Do you mean, "Brrap brrap pew pew"? Yeah, that's what I did.
"Pshow, kapow.
" That's not what a gun sounds like.
Prrow! Pshow, kapow! Bop! Brrap brrap pew pew! Ppew, ping! Can everyone please stop making gun sounds? It is really freaking me out.
My point is, everyone's listening to you now.
Soon people are gonna get bored and move onto the next thing and you'll hate yourself that you weren't able to make a difference when you had the chance.
Believe me, it happens sooner than you think.
Oh Hi.
I'm A Ryan Sea Okay, we're here, finally.
Get out.
Ooh, can we make one more stop? I just remembered we left my wife back at the house.
Can we go back? Pwease? Driver? The man said, "Pwease.
" That's it.
Enough.
I am not your driver.
It is I, BoJack.
BoJack? What are you doing? I was gonna prank Jurj by hitting him with this bat, but you got into the car because, apparently, you are a two-timing liar.
What's the thing with the bat? BoJack, this is not a good look on you.
All this time, I thought you believed in me.
This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.
It has nothing to do with whether you're a good publicist or not.
I am a marvelous publicist.
Not to me.
You're doing great work for this asshole who loves pranks.
You're pranking him right now.
Yeah, with a bad prank to show how stupid pranks are.
Seems a little convoluted, which is actually a trademark of a great prank.
Well played, sir.
No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point.
Pranks are dumb.
We're late, and I won't keep going round and round with you on this.
Publicists have many clients.
Not my publicist.
You're fired.
Are you kidding? Who fires Ana Spanakopita? I do.
I just did.
Who's gonna set up your press appearances? Your hopeless agent? Your idiot sidekick? Not your problem.
Get the hell out of my limo.
'Cause I gotta pick up a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.
Sextina, welcome to the program.
Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans? Tom, abortion is a very serious subject.
Yes, very serious, I agree.
I want to tell the real story about abortion, show America what it's really about, which is why your girl Sextina Aquafina is gonna have her abortion live on television.
What what? Pay-per-view, chitches.
What? What? "Pay-per-view, chitches.
" Brrap brrap, pew pew, ka-ching ka-ching.
How are you going to have an abortion on live TV when you're not even really having an abortion? Duh, we'll just Argo that shit.
What does that mean? Yeah, yeah.
Fake abortion.
Movie magic, like in Argo.
That is not what happened in Argo.
If we're gonna do this, we got to be real tasteful.
Yeah, only the best for my abortion.
All class.
John Carpenter can do the practical effects.
He owes me a favor.
What? We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.
Are you hearing yourselves? We're not going to fake an abortion on live TV.
Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.
Then put a little box in the corner of the screen that says "Live.
" You don't think this is incredibly disrespectful to the women who actually get abortions? Not if we do it tasteful.
Diane, this is what the client wants.
Stop making it about you.
I'm not making it about me.
I am so tired of you creating problems.
I'm not I'm sorry you're so fertile and in a sexually active, loving relationship and now you don't want a family.
I'm sure that's really hard for you.
What? Uh if this is not about me anymore, then I'mma go.
Y'all figure your shit out and get back at me.
Where's that ZZ Top mofo at? Can a chitch get a parking validation or what? Is there something you want to say to me? I have given everything to get where I am, and I am not about to throw all that away.
She wants an abortion? I'm getting her an abortion.
You know this is bullshit.
It's all bullshit, Diane.
That's the gig.
And you're not good enough at this job to be too good for this job.
I won't be a part of this.
Yo, Beardo, where did you go? I need to get my parking validation did, or I cannot leave.
Y'all's trippin' if you think Sextina Aquafina is paying $15 for parking.
All right, new publicist.
What do you got for me? Secretariat was an athlete, right? And you used to be an athlete.
What? No, I didn't.
You didn't play baseball and football? Oh, um You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.
Did you think I was Bo Jackson? This idea I know you're going to like.
You know that car wash on Alvarado? They need someone to dress up like a gorilla and spin a sign.
Why would I do that? Anything that gets your face out there, right? How does it get my face out there dressed like a gorilla? Maybe that one's a dud, but hey, you think Lou Bega knocked it out of the park with "Mambo Number One"? No, but he kept at it.
I'm making things all about me? I'm the one who's having an abortion.
It's ridiculous.
They're completely morally bankrupt.
I agree with you, 247 percent.
I just wrote "morally bankrupt" on this form.
You were right to do that.
This form is being very nosy right now.
Why did I even take that job? You were going through a rough time, Princess Carolyn wanted to help you and she offered you the job.
Which she should not have done.
So morally bankrupt.
Okay, yeah, that was nice.
But still, she is putting her company's bottom line before the very real damage that bottle-nosed maniac is doing every time she gets on the news and That's it, the news.
I gotta take the high road, go on the news and rat those suckers out.
Is that really a good idea? It is if you think it is, because I am here to support you no matter what, but maybe it isn't the best idea? Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt? Someone has to tell the world that Sextina is a total fraud.
You know Sextina Aquafina? Oh.
Yeah, I mean, I work with her.
Oh.
She is so cool.
Sextina's music makes me feel strong, like I can do anything.
It doesn't offend you? What about the part where she says, "I hope and pray to God my little fetus has a soul 'cause I want it to feel pain when I eject it from my hole"? It's a joke.
You get that it's a joke, right? Well, obviously.
Do you think she actually wants to shoot her fetus with a gun? No, I get it.
Getting an abortion is scary.
With all the protesters out front, how you have to listen to the heartbeat and all that.
When you can joke about it, it makes it less scary, you know? Yeah.
Diane? Ana? I won't be working with Jurj anymore.
I let him know this morning.
First he thought I was doing a really good prank, but eventually I think he understood.
You dropped Jurj? Jurj Clooners? Sexiest Man in America Jurj Clooners? Jurj is easy.
Everyone loves him.
I've got a master's degree in Publicist, it's time to put that to use.
I dropped all my other clients.
You're the underdog.
I want to put all my attention on you and get you that Oscar.
So nobody else, huh? Good.
Just all your hopes and dreams pinned on me.
Somehow beating the odds and winning the highest possible accolade in an actor's career.
I know we can do it.
Just me, huh? Wow, that's actually.
That Is someone standing on my windpipe? Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we No, BoJack.
I believe in you, okay? Okay.
Whoa, Ana, what are you? Oh, boy.
Shh It's okay.
When you fired me, it was thrilling.
Oh.
Ana Nobody talks to me like that.
It reminded me that I work for you, and I liked that.
Okay, but Do you like that? Being in control? Being the star? Yes.
You're my star, BoJack.
My shining star.
But don't you ever Ow, too tight.
try to screw me again.
Ouch! Oh, please.
Do you understand? Yes.
God, yes.
Good.
I'll see you tomorrow bright and early.
You have my undivided attention now.
Uh How are you feeling, Sextina? A little queasy but on the whole, wonderful.
Good.
Now, I do accept tips.
That was surprisingly tasteful.
And educational, right? Yeah.
Weirdly educational.
I actually learned a lot about abortion, and I just had an abortion.
How are you feeling? I feel shitty.
I mean, physically.
I'm glad I did it, but mostly I just felt old.
There were all these teenagers there.
Twenty-somethings.
I know from the outside, it might seem like I should be ready for kids, but I can't Diane, you don't need to explain anything to anyone.
Sextina.
Great job, we did it.
Yeah, so, little wrinkle.
I've been having a lot of sex, you know, 'cause I'm a sexual creature and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.
I just found out I got knocked up for real.
What? And I think I want to keep it.
But that might be a little confusing to my fans, since they just saw me get the old scoopity doopity? Okay, we're gonna handle this.
Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.
First thing is we gotta get her out of town before she starts to show.
Yeah, we'll send her to that farm where celebrities go to disappear, where Chad Michael Murray and Thora Birch went.
Film a bunch of music videos now, and then Release them over the next year so it seems like she's still around.
Then when she comes back, we'll say she adopted a baby.
People are going to love that.
Yeah.
Everyone loves a baby.
[groaning.]
[mumbling.]
[gagging.]
[voices overlapping.]
[groaning.]
Guys, I think we could use another phone jack over here.
[phone ringing.]
Cabracadabra.
We wanna reach out and grab you.
No, we're a cab company.
Can you toss me the thing? [grunting.]
Sorry.
The other thing.
[Todd.]
Okay.
Watch the couch.
Hey.
Goddammit! [yelling.]
I apologize for I understand.
Mind if I put you on hold one second? Don't put me on hold.
Do you know who I am? I just won a Baby's Choice Award, the winner of which has gone to take home the Oscar seven of the last 15 years.
So, yeah, that BoJack Horseman.
Otherwise known as the guy you keep sending your dumb newspaper to even though I never subscribed to it.
I'm putting you on hold.
[muttering.]
[buzzing.]
We have a situation, sir.
Talk to me.
Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.
He's pretty steamed.
I've tried everything, but we might need to bring the Closer in on this one.
Calm down.
We can sort this out without having to get the Closer involved.
Did you offer 26 weeks at 50 percent off the newsstand price? I went through the entire checklist, sir.
Even offered him a free tote bag.
What kind of monster says no to a tote bag? Good work, rep.
You've done all that could be expected of you.
I'll take it from here.
Yeah, Got it.
Right.
I understand.
I'll take it from here.
God help us Is what I'd say if we needed God's help.
Fortunately, we got one better.
Morning.
Good morning.
How was your weekend? How are you? Good work yesterday.
Get out of my way, please.
[sighing.]
We have a situation on line two.
Name's Horseman.
BoJack Horseman.
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
Hello, good morning, and I say this with 100 percent sincerity How can I help you? [funky electronic music.]
I never subscribed to the L.
A.
Gazette.
I do not read the L.
A.
Gazette.
I have called this number so many times to stop sending it to me.
Yet every morning, I open my door on a new edition of the L.
A.
Gazette.
It's like I'm in a boring episode of The Twilight Zone.
Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.
But before we dig in, is there anything I can get you? A glass of ice water perhaps? Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.
Fabulous.
Johnny will get that to you in three, two, one [drone whirring.]
Uh huh.
I see you've been receiving our paper for six months, but there's no record of you ever registering a complaint.
From whence the hostility, counselor? It wasn't a problem until recently, because up until a week ago the boy who lives with me used the paper to make a giant paper-mÃ¢chÃ© Todd head.
What was that? I live with my best friend, Todd.
Good kid, but sometimes he gets ideas to do things.
[groaning, screaming.]
Pretty scary, right? Yes.
What the hell is that? Giant Todd Head, of course.
I've been working on him for the last six months.
What? Why? It all started when a rustling from the kitchen jostled me from tender slumber.
[blinds rattling.]
[panting.]
Uh What was that? [gasping.]
If there's a ghost present, please do not scream or have a skull face or be wearing a tattered white satin gown.
[gasping.]
Someone or something is stealing our food.
I made a giant papier-mÃ¢chÃ© Todd head to scare it away.
Think it'll work? If I made a giant papier-mÃ¢chÃ© me head, would you stop eating my food? You should take this seriously.
We might have an infestation.
We do have an infestation, of Todds.
Look at that, they're getting bigger.
And? Did the head help to ameliorate your pest peccadillo? No.
Todd abandoned the project as soon as he started working on Cabracadabra.
What's Cabracadabra? That's what I said.
What's Cabracadabra? That's what I said.
What's Cabracadabra? That's what we want you to say.
If I didn't know any better, you were about to pitch an idea.
We are about to pitch you an idea.
I did not know better.
Has this ever happened to you? Hey, where you headed? Oh, yes.
That happens to me all the time.
We're not at the main part yet.
I'm so sorry.
Please continue.
To the opera, good sir.
Okay.
Am I watching to see if the whole thing has happened to me? Or looking for one specific thing? Kind of both.
So I just keep watching until I see something that has happened to me? Yes.
What if we get to the end, none of it has ever happened to me? Maybe just try to put yourself in Emily's shoes right now.
Got it.
Sorry for the interruption.
Please continue.
So, is this where you live? Yes, it is.
Alone or are you in a relationship? This hardly seems appropriate.
Driver, you're starting to make me feel uncomfortable.
Yeah, Todd.
What are you doing? Has a creepy driver ever given you his number or told you that you reminded him of his dead girlfriend? Or repeated your address slowly, like he was trying to memorize it? No, never.
Unfortunately, if you are a woman all those things would happen to you every day.
That's right, Todd.
According to my own research, nine out of ten men are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.
But what if there was a ride-share service that could guarantee no creepy men drivers because there are no men drivers at all? What are you saying, robot drivers? What if they become sentient and try to murder us, or unionize? That could be a real headache.
No, not murderous robots.
Women.
Todd, you have done it again.
Actually, Emily and I came up with it together.
Todd and Emily, you've done it again for the first time.
And that's why we're setting up shop at your house.
Why does it have to be my house? There's no room at Mr.
Peanutbutter's house.
It's full of spaghetti strainers.
Why? Who can recall? I figure the longer they're there, the bigger the payoff.
And they've been sitting there for months now.
So you can bet the payoff's going to be pretty huge.
[The Closer.]
So, why did you let them use your house? Hey, Todd, where do you want this? [both.]
Uh [BoJack.]
I felt guilty.
[The Closer.]
About what? [BoJack.]
Todd had this old girlfriend.
I met her a couple weeks back.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you still doing up? I got thirsty.
Then you came to the right place.
Should we call Todd, see if he wants to join us? I'm tired of trying to figure out what Todd wants.
And what do you want? I'll start with a whiskey.
My kind of girl.
So then we had sex.
What? Why? I was lonely? She was there? Why does anyone have sex with anyone? Intimacy, affection, a deep need to connect to the world at large.
The same reasons three million people subscribe to the L.
A.
Gazette.
What? I'm getting ahead of myself.
Please, continue your story.
[exhaling.]
You should go.
Yeah.
That was a mistake.
Agreed.
A wonderful, sexy mistake for you and a regular mistake for me.
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.
What are we gonna tell Todd? Nothing, obviously.
I don't want to hurt him.
Neither do I.
That's why we won't tell him.
I feel like we should tell him.
That feeling is you selfishly trying to assuage your guilt.
If you cared about Todd, you would keep this a secret forever.
I'm not good at lying.
Ask me if when I was a little girl, did I ever used to put a stuffed animal in my underpants and rock back and forth on it.
When you were a little girl, did you ever do that thing you said? What? Get [stammers.]
No! I think it's gonna be fine.
Why would it even come up? Not like there's any reason the three of us would ever be in a room together again.
BoJack, you remember Emily, right? I've never seen you before in my life.
No.
You don't remember BoJack? Oh, yeah.
BoJack.
What why What are you here? Why are you doing at Todd's house? Todd's house? This is my house.
It's cool if we set up shop here, right? That's not gonna be weird? What? Why would that be weird? What are you implying? Nothing.
It's not weird for me either, if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.
Okay, what is going on here? Why would you? I don't even Literally nothing going on.
No, something's going on.
I've got a nose for news.
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter representing the variable for "What Is Going On?" So let's solve for Nu, shall we? I think someone's not saying something to someone else about something.
That's crazy.
I know what it is.
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.
No one wants to say it out loud because we're afraid we'll jinx it.
Yeah.
That is exactly what it is.
Yes.
Your stupid business is gonna be very successful.
Yes.
Glad that's out in the open.
We all know what everyone was thinking, we don't need to ask any more questions or do any wondering about mysteries.
Nope.
If you'll excuse me, I need to go watch a sport.
Great idea.
The worst part is things have actually been going really well with Todd.
Our friendship is in a really good place.
Last week he said, "Did you know the wiener dog is neither a wiener nor a dog?" Instead of saying, "Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay.
" [The Closer.]
So, why did you sleep with Emily? Do you think that part of you was getting uncomfortable with that closeness? You felt like you didn't deserve Todd's friendship and you wanted to somehow externalize that feeling into action? No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that? When you do bad things, you have something you can point to when people eventually leave you.
It's not you, you tell yourself, it's that bad thing you did.
Do you often keep people at arm's length? Are you afraid of being known and knowing others? Yeah, you know, I think that you're definitely hitting on something real that I would love to drill down into, but I gotta go to this marketing meeting now.
Which is so annoying because I totally want to keep talking about that thing you're talking about.
But marketing meetings, right? I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow? Of course.
Great.
Bye.
So, how was your marketing meeting? Weird.
Sorry I'm late.
It's fine.
We're just getting started.
I had the worst morning.
Hanging on every word.
Don't tell us.
So I drove here, right? I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage when I realize I don't have my key card.
I gotta drive all the way home to get it.
When I got there, I couldn't find it anywhere.
Suddenly, I remember, I put it in the glove compartment.
It was in my car the entire time.
Okay.
Because I was driving back and forth so much, I ran out of gas.
I pulled into a 76.
I was about to pump the gas, I realized I didn't have my credit card, when I remembered it was on my desk at home because I used it to contribute to my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.
Diane Have you donated to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet? Oh, shit.
Throw her 50 bucks.
You can afford it.
Yeah, but I don't like feeling like I have to, Roxy.
Does the world need a stop-motion short film about a pig who goes to circus school? Think of it like you're doing a nice thing for your friend.
Mmm okay.
I called a cab to take me home to get my credit card.
Then back to the gas station, get my car, fill it up and come here.
So that's why I'm late.
Why did you tell us that whole story? I don't know.
Why did you tell me that whole story? I don't know.
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up some options for the new Secretariat ads.
Good news is the movie is killing out there.
Everyone loves it.
If everyone loves it, why do we need a new ad campaign? These are the "For Your Consideration" ads.
They're a reminder to the Academy, "Have you considered this yet?" The Academy doesn't always consider everything.
So they need constant consideration reminders.
That's very considerate.
This one tested the best.
That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.
Dumb.
Dumb.
Stupid.
Offensive.
Ugly.
Boring.
Typical.
Stupid.
Bad.
Hideous.
Disgusting.
Gross.
ClichÃ©.
I am really good at this.
Huh.
I kind of like this one.
How'd that piece of crap get in there? We ruled that one out.
It's actually really powerful.
[The Closer.]
What spoke to you about that particular ad? [BoJack.]
I don't know.
All the pictures of me, they looked backwards.
When I looked at the mirror ad, I was seeing me as I see myself and I thought there was something beautiful about that.
Intimate, almost.
Of course you like this ad.
When you look at it you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.
"Hello, old turtle.
Are you Secretariat? No? You're just some old turtle? What the hell? You've aged terribly.
" But you've got the heart of a champion.
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars who say different.
Isn't that the point of the movie, that anybody could be Secretariat? The point of the movie is to make a lot of money and win awards.
If anyone who looks at this ad is Secretariat, why should you win the Oscar? He's right, BoJack.
Why don't you leave this to the experts, okay? Yes.
You're a star.
[moaning.]
[The Closer.]
So, you also had sex with your publicist? [BoJack.]
Yeah, couple times.
We have a very complicated relationship.
It's complicated.
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep movie, it would be Doubt.
Don't forget, you have Ellen tomorrow.
Don't wear that sweater I hate.
Yes.
You're in charge.
Okay, you know, I gotta say I don't feel like I'm in charge.
If you're gonna throw a tantrum, forget the whole thing.
I'm not throwing a tantrum Why are we having sex in my car? Can we at least go back to your place? No, BoJack.
I don't know where you live.
You control every part of my life, I don't know anything about you.
[scoffs.]
You don't want to know me, BoJack.
No, I do.
I want to be known and know others.
You don't.
I know you and I know what you want.
This is exactly what you want.
[The Closer.]
What do you think she meant by that? Better question, why am I still getting the L.
A.
Gazette? Do you think getting the paper every day is a reminder of Todd's papier-mÃ¢chÃ© head? The project he abandoned to make time for the old girlfriend you spent an intimate night with? Could that be why you want to cancel your subscription? No.
I want to cancel my subscription because newspapers are dumb.
I feel I'm very clear on this point.
Every morning, someone knocks on my door and says, "Throw away this garbage for me.
" So you don't feel any guilt about your tryst with Emily? Well, I have had trouble sleeping.
[Emily and Todd laughing.]
[Todd.]
You're silly.
[Emily.]
No, you're silly.
Oh, God.
Okay, your turn, truth or dare.
Truth.
What is the worst recent thing you did to someone who cared about you? The worst thing? Or the most recent? Both.
Can you keep it down, please? Some people are trying to sleep.
We are keeping it down.
We've been really quiet.
You're basically shouting.
Sorry.
Do you want me to whisper? Like this? Yeah, we can be real whispery.
No, because then I'll hear the "psst, psst, psst.
" And I'll be up all night wondering what you're talking about.
Uh, what would we be talking about? Yeah, BoJack.
What would we be talking about? I don't know.
Dumb stuff.
Forget it.
Can't sleep here.
I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.
[sighing.]
Freeze, candy ass.
[gasping.]
Character Actress Margo Mart? I said, "Freeze.
" [The Closer.]
Hold on.
Are you telling me esteemed character actress and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale has been living in your boat? Is this one of those situations where everything we discuss is confidential, due to customer service rep-client privilege? Of course.
Then yes, Margo Martindale is living in my boat.
How long have you been in here? Well, after the incident in Yorba Linda.
[yelling.]
[moaning.]
Eh Well, Margo, old gal, looks like you've bought yourself another day of freedom.
But at what cost? I knew I had to lay low.
Go off the grid, disappear.
I know what "lay low" means.
So, I disappeared for a little bit.
Mm-hmm.
Somewhere I knew I had no chance of being discovered regional theater.
I did a run at the La Jolla Playhouse in an obscure Tennessee Williams play.
I have ambition, sir.
Dreams that don't incorporate the concerns of cynics like you.
Cynic.
Always laughing that terrible laugh.
Ramona Well, go ahead and laugh.
Laugh your life away.
I can laugh, too.
[laughing.]
Ramona, I'm telling you [wailing.]
She's dead.
[applause.]
I was good.
Too good.
The San Diego Union-Tribune called me, "A talent to watch.
" I knew I had to get out of there.
And you've been living here ever since? That's right.
I also did an arc on The Good Wife.
Other than that, laying low.
The Good Wife? How did you go on a nationally broadcast TV show with no one catching you? I disappeared into the role, BoJack.
It's called acting.
Try it sometime.
And you're the one who's been stealing our food.
You already know too much.
Smoke bomb.
Hi-yah! Why did you throw a plum on the floor? Thought it was a smoke bomb.
Where are my smoke bombs? I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.
Hey.
BoJack's back.
Yup.
My two favorite people in a room together with me.
You bet.
Isn't this great, BoJack? The three of us under one roof? Yeah.
It's like Three Men and a Baby.
But there's only two men, and the baby's a lady.
[laughing.]
Uh-huh.
[yawning.]
[chattering.]
[sighing.]
[The Closer.]
With all this turmoil and upheaval, sure would be nice to have something you can depend on.
Something that arrives every day at your doorstep, with a robust arts section.
Let me tell you something about the L.
A.
Gazette.
I don't think you finished the story about your publicist.
What happened when you told her you wanted to know her? Oh, right.
Well If we're gonna work together and also have weird kinky car sex, I wanna know something about you.
What do you wanna know? I was married once.
I have a son I'm not allowed to see.
My favorite fruit is honeydew.
Gross, is that true? Does it matter? Listen, I've been with guys like you before, and I know this thing works better if we keep a little distance.
And [grunting.]
[groaning.]
Well, that worked.
Okay, we're done.
I'll see you tomorrow.
[The Closer.]
So, that's how you left things? [BoJack.]
That's how she left things.
But then I followed her home.
[The Closer.]
You did what? [BoJack.]
She lives in this tiny apartment in the Valley.
I could see her through the window and I just watched her being normal.
Oh! [sighing.]
[The Closer.]
There's something very intimate about watching a person be herself.
[BoJack.]
But it wasn't good intimate, like when you see your mom cry.
It was bad intimate, like when your dad writes a poem about Lena Horne's nipples, makes you read it out loud so he can hear if it scans.
[The Closer.]
She warned you that you wouldn't want to know her.
[BoJack.]
Yeah.
She was right.
It's so sad that when you see someone as they really are, it ruins them.
Do you have someone you can talk to? About what? These feelings you have, your self-destructive behavior.
You know that old joke about how many psychiatrists does it take to screw in a light bulb? The answer is just one, but the light bulb has to want to change? I don't know that joke.
That's it.
That's the whole joke.
The light bulb has to want to change.
[laughing.]
Yeah.
Psychiatrists are idiots.
That's actually not the point of the joke.
Hey.
I need to talk to you.
What the I'm on the phone.
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.
Oh, it's too much heat.
I'm taking your boat out to international waters.
You never saw me.
On the phone.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
What I want is to have control over my own life.
[engine starting.]
Which is why I'm begging you to please cancel my delivery of the L.
A.
Gazette.
I don't think you want to do that.
I promise you I do.
No, because that's just theater.
It allows you to think you're in control, but the whole idea of control is a myth.
The universe is a wild beast.
You can't tame it.
All you can do is try to live inside it.
Live inside the beast? That's a mixed metaphor.
But you're right.
Great.
I'm going to sign you up for another six months.
Since you've been such a sport, I'm throwing in a tote bag.
Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.
Okay, so I'm a passenger.
Remember the three D's: drive safely, drive efficiently, and don't harass the passenger.
Todd, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
Driver, pull over, please.
[imitating car braking.]
[imitating opening door.]
Can I talk to you alone? Of course.
Driver, put up the partition, please.
[imitating partition whirring.]
I've been thinking, and you should do this without me.
What? But the whole point is we're doing it together.
But you don't need me anymore.
You have a whole team of coders, and I don't think that I can work in this house.
What's wrong with the house? Todd, I just I need to go.
[imitating opening door.]
I don't understand.
Did I do something to make you feel uncomfortable? No.
You are great.
It's me and BoJack.
BoJack? [sighing.]
What did he do this time? I don't think I've been a very good friend to you.
Things happened and I don't think BoJack's been a very good friend to you either.
Oh, okay.
You should buy me out of the company.
No, no, no, keep your share.
Who knows? It might be worth something someday.
You're sweet, Todd.
You shouldn't waste that on people who don't deserve it.
Hey, you want this plum? I found it in the kitchen.
Sure.
[smoke bomb fizzing.]
[both.]
Whoa! [coughing.]
Weird plum.
[knocking on door.]
How did you know where I live? Ana You need to leave.
No, I know that it's exciting to remain mysterious and in control, but control is a myth.
That's a conclusion I came to recently by myself.
I can't do this now.
I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed, I wanna see what you look like waking up.
You are a beautiful, sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.
And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.
And you don't have to be, either.
Okay.
And I want to go with the mirror ads for Secretariat.
BoJack, no, listen.
Ana.
This is my campaign, I know what I'm doing.
Call up Turteltaub and tell him I won't be pushed around on this.
I'm the star and what I say goes.
Okay.
[cars honking.]
[Ana.]
Hmm [Carolyn.]
It kind of just looks like a billboard for the sky.
I didn't think this part through.
No kidding.
The sky is Secretariat? The sky wants you to nominate it for an Oscar? It is eerily beautiful.
Like an art piece that resists interpretation.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Wouldn't want the ad for my movie to be interpretable.
If you stand where I'm standing, you see a reflection of the KIIS-FM billboard.
Beautiful.
So we spent half a million dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.
When the sun goes down and hits that billboard, that's gonna That's gonna be a real problem.
Well, the good news is BoJack got what he wanted.
[sighing.]
[bird screeching.]
[all gasping.]
Ugh.
When you two first came into my office, I was like, "This marriage is not going to last.
" But you've really put the work in.
I deem your marriage fixed.
Thanks, Dr.
Janet.
We couldn't have done this without you and your many novelty certificates.
Well, this has certainly been a big year for the Rabitowitz marriage.
It certainly has.
But now it's New Year's Eve and, Katie, my New Year's resolution to you is to spend more time with my wonderful wife, who I I gotta take this.
Oh, um, but Hello.
Hey, partner, big news.
Huge news.
I'm all ears.
The Flight of the Pegasus just lost their lead.
They start shooting next week.
So what you're telling me is David Pincher needs a new star immediately for his three-picture young adult dystopian future franchise? Yup.
What's that I hear? Beep beep.
Someone's calling on the other line.
That's strange.
Hello? It's Oodles of Money calling.
Will we accept the charges? Why would Oodles of Money be calling collect? I don't know.
Don't accept the charges, we cannot afford it.
I gotta go in.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
But make sure you're back before, you know.
Deal.
Best deal I ever made.
Boom! What's black and white and sexy all over? Chuff Hollister.
He's young, he's hot, he's Australian or British or whatever.
We can paint over his stripes so he looks like a horse.
I can see the headline now, Chuff Hollister is The next Pegasus.
BoJack's got star power and grit up the wazoo.
I can't imagine Anyone who would appeal to the audience more than Chuff.
He's got sex appeal Gravitas Youth Experience And abs coming out of the wazoo.
And what a wazoo it is.
This would put Gekko-Rabitowitz On the map.
The map of profitable agencies, that is.
Perfect, because without it we could be in Real trouble.
We did not hit our projected earnings for the year.
The year's not over yet.
We still have one day to go all out.
Rutabaga, do you think we have the spunk and moxie That's a good name for a lady detective series.
Required to pull this off and save the agency? Hell yeah, I do.
That would be a great title for a movie about marrying Satan.
How are we losing money? Vanessa, we're getting Chuff this part and coming out on top.
I know we will, because we're the good guys.
Suck a duck a duck a dick, dumbshit.
Hey, Sarah Lynn.
Hey, loser.
Did you get a call about that Ethan Around thing? You're not gonna do it, are you? I'm sorry, what thing? Ethan Around, the Horsin' Around sequel series Brad's trying to get made? He called to ask me, I asked him, can you put a bullet in my brain? That would probably be a better career move.
Wait, slow down.
Did you say Ethan Around? I know.
It should be Sabrina Around, right? That's a show people would watch.
Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricks and eating kettle corn.
Hold on, if this was a real thing, why would Brad call you and not me? Who knows? Why do people do anything? Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma from Pocahontas my emergency contact? Are you sure this whole thing isn't just a semi-lucid fever dream from mixing the wrong pills? Did you not hear? I'm clean and sober, eight months.
Really? That's incredible.
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.
Because I heard if you stop doing drugs for a while, the first time you do them again, it's amazing.
What? No, just stay sober.
Ugh! Whatever.
Call me when you're ready to party.
Well, that's troubling.
Can you believe they're doing a Horsin' Around reboot without me? What do you care? You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.
Not the point.
This is about respect.
BoJack, is this really a good idea? Tools.
Brad speaking.
You're doing a new show in the extended Horsin' Around cinematic universe and you didn't call me? Hey, BoJack.
Ethan Around is just an idea I had.
It's not officially happening or anything.
I would love for you to be part of it, but the horse died in the series finale.
So? We could write around that.
The Horse dying was just a dream.
The Horse had a twin brother, comes back as a ghost.
Ethan missed the Horse so much he built a robot Horse as a tribute.
"I've heard of overloaded motherboards, but this is ridiculous.
" Those are off the top of my head, they're all gold.
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.
I've been having trouble getting networks on the phone, but with a big star like you attached, we could sell this right away.
I wouldn't say I'm attached Don't move.
I'm getting the next flight down to LA.
Right now? And purchased.
BoJack, for the last 20 years I've been telling people I didn't need the trappings of fame, that I was better off, happy with my little B-plus life at my little B-plus hardware store in little B-plus Olympia, Washington.
B-minus children.
But it's a lie.
I miss the warmth of the spotlight on my face.
The thrill of telling a joke and feeling it land.
Is that a thrill you experienced? The sitcom stage is my home, and I'm tired of denying myself that.
I'm ready to come home.
Great.
Why did you let me call him? Ugh.
Ah, smell that Labrador Peninsula air.
Keep an eye out for my brother.
How will I know which one's him? He's the one that looks like me.
Got it.
Hello? Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Is this an okay time to talk business? Yeah, I'm just waiting for Captain Peanutbutter.
What is that, like, a cereal? No, my brother.
He's picking us up at the airport.
Nice.
Speaking of driving people places, Cabracadabra had a killer holiday season and I think New Year's is going to be even bigger.
I'm loving that segue, Todd.
You are a conversational Magellan.
Turns out there's a huge demand for a safe space for women.
Who knew? Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.
So I was thinking, what's the next step? What if we made our safe space for women also available to men? That's an untapped market.
All right, then it's agreed.
No goodbye? He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.
Mr.
Peanutbutter and Captain Peanutbutter in the same room? What is this, a flashback episode? Captain Peanutbutter, you old so-and-so.
Get over here.
Careful.
Where's Mrs.
Captain Peanutbutter? She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.
She sends her love.
And this noogie.
Whoo! Diane, this is my big brother.
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.
And you always will be.
It's nice to meet you, Captain.
Hey, put that thing away.
You're family.
Oh! So David Pincher is about to shoot the Flight of the Pegasus trilogy in New Zealand, and BoJack is perfect for the lead.
A part like that would really underline that BoJack's more than just an actor, he's a movie star.
If I'm doing that, I conveniently won't be able to do that dumbass Ethan Around show.
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.
Why don't you tell him you don't want to do it? I can't.
I'm like a father figure to him I slept with his mother.
Gross.
No.
I slept with her 20 years ago.
She was young then, not gross.
Ugh! Hey, loved you in The Caveman's Valentine.
Hmm? Nothing? The Caveman's Valentine? Samuel L.
Jackson had that big beard? Look it up.
When you start laughing, call me.
Will do.
Do we have an offer on the Pegasus movie? I'll get it, Kalamata.
Don't get your pita in a wad.
Wow.
Flight of the Pegasus.
This must be what Robert Downey Jr.
felt like when he woke up on that stranger's bathroom floor and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.
It's another unseasonably warm day in the Labrador Peninsula and things are looking sunny all the way to the new year.
It really is true what they say Nothing bad ever happens on the Labrador Peninsula.
Oh, paradise.
Uncle Mister.
Uncle Mister.
Now who let these little monsters onto my peninsula? We're your nephews.
What? I don't remember my nephews being made out of candy.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Look at those children.
Little miracles, right? They're adorable, not that I value them based on their looks.
Because, of course, children in society today are often reduced to their cuteness.
I can't wait to get to know your children as people, so I can specifically compliment them individually on the foundation of their characters.
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.
Uh Do you believe in the soul? What? Life is the most precious resource we have.
Remember that, Diane.
Okay.
Pretty great, right? Did you tell your brother about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N? The audition? No, I could never tell him about that.
He thinks I'm offer-only, it would break his heart.
Wait, what audition? No, the abortion.
Oh, no.
Should I have? He said some weird stuff to me earlier.
The kind of stuff you'd hear in a sad Creed song.
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya, but he's a good dog.
All bark, no bite.
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.
I guess in human terms it would be: He's all talk, and no shooting you with an assault rifle.
Is that what you think humans do? Am I wrong? Boom! This is David Pincher.
And this is everyone who works for him.
Now unfortunately for us, everyone on this board must really like their boss's movies, because for the holidays, they're all Gone Girl.
Thank you, except for her.
Boom.
The assistant to David Pincher's casting director.
Wait a second, I know that face.
Why does she look so familiar? Oh, fish.
Oh, fish.
So when I found out that the best assistant I ever had was working for David Pincher, I mean, what are the odds? Did he hire you because of your cute little Benjamin Button-nose? I'll put in a good word for BoJack, but I'm just an assistant.
Just an assistant? Laura, assistants are everything.
You're the first people in, the last people out.
You know everyone's real name, age, nose, teeth, and tits.
You have power, because in today's economy the only true power is information.
I want you to use that power.
I want you to get your boss to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.
I always believed in you, Laura.
do you believe in yourself? Wow, that's I'm sorry, did you just make that up? Because that was Is that a speech you had ready to go? Will you do this for me? Of course.
You went to bat for me when I tried to get a promotion at Vigor.
I pushed so hard for you.
I did everything I could.
I mean, we gals gotta look out for each other.
Right? Right.
So you're talking about a merger? Since my dad croaked I've been running Vigor myself, and I've been doing a pretty good job, A-minus/B-plus.
But I could use a few more experienced hands to help guide the ship, because being a boss is really hard.
Yes.
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.
I'm glad you came to me first.
I would have gone to her directly, but sometimes she yells at me and I do not like being yelled at and that is just something that people need to understand about me.
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.
So on the new show Ethan is the dad, and he's raising three little horses.
You couldn't have told me this over the phone? This show is going to change my life.
I'm taking the kids out of school and moving everyone down here.
I just had an offer accepted on a house in Sherman Oaks.
As long as I don't change my mind before the new year, boom.
Two million dollars, gone.
The new year? That's tonight.
I know.
Did you talk to my agent by any chance? No.
She didn't call you? I talked to her, and I don't know if she wants me to do it.
You know how agents are.
Just remember, I'm not the bad guy here.
I hear you loud and clear.
Don't worry.
We won't take no for an answer.
I think my schedule's gonna be tough Might be going to New Zealand.
We'll work around your schedule.
Those bastards got my quote so damn high.
We'll pay it.
No obstacle is insurmountable.
As long as you want to do it.
And I do want to do it.
Get me out of this thing.
This asshole's giving me everything I ask for.
What a nightmare.
Tell him you don't want to do the show.
I can't.
It would destroy him.
Destroying people is what I pay you to do, so I don't think about the people I'm destroying.
Do you not know what an agent is? BoJack, are you okay in there? Is it number one or number two? That cat's running circles around us.
What are we going to do? Maybe we can distract her? I'm thinking laser pointer.
If we're going to beat her, we need to think like her.
Instead of convincing the Pegasus people they don't want BoJack, what if we convince BoJack he doesn't want Pegasus? Fantastic.
How do we do that? Kelsey.
Kelsey? That's what I said when they said you wanted to meet with me.
I figured you never wanted to see me again.
I never want to see anyone again, but there's a book I've been trying to turn into a movie and I need your help.
It's a coming-of-age story about a girl who likes jellybeans.
The option expires tonight at midnight, unless I can find a big enough star to secure funding.
Frankly, I already gave up on it.
Then my agent said, "Maybe BoJack's interested.
" So the reason you think I'm right for the role is because I'm a big enough star to secure funding? Don't get smart, BoJack.
You're not good at it.
You're really giving the hard sell here.
I hear they've got you locked in to some fantasy dystopia thing.
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit for the rest of your life? For work or, like, in general? I saw something in you, something most people don't know you have, and it kills me that instead of sharing it with the world, you want to hide it under some wonderland unicorn nonsense.
It's a Pegasus.
Unicorns are for babies.
The movie I want to make isn't glamorous or sexy.
You don't get to be the big hero everybody loves.
You get to be a guy who works at a gas station, who gets in a fight with his daughter about jellybeans.
That's the whole movie.
It's small and it's real.
And you'd get to work with a director who sees you.
And I can't sell it any better than that.
You're right, that one scene we shot that didn't even make it into the Secretariat movie was the best thing I ever did.
Why am I wasting my time with this other stuff? So you're in? Let's do it.
Great.
How's your little friend with the face? Is he up to his old tricks, getting into scrapes? What a little scamp.
Will you tell him I said hi? Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element or the fact you'll be working for peanuts? This jellybean thing could show the world that BoJack's more than just a movie star.
He's an actor.
Yeah, well, that's great, but I've been working all day on getting him the Pegasus movie you said would show the world he's a movie star.
I don't want that anymore.
I want to do something real.
You realize how much money we'd be walking away from? This isn't about money.
Doesn't matter to me.
Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.
Right.
So what's the problem? Maybe you can find a way for BoJack to do both? You're supposed to be this amazing agent, after all.
I'll see what I can do.
New beers for the new year's? We got a regular Maya Angelou over here.
Good times.
Oh, it's Todd.
Gotta take this.
Maybe you can call him back later? Todd! Don't be too long, or I'm gonna drink all your beer.
Diane, do you ever look up at the stars and feel like they're tiny holes in the sky, sucking out all the oxygen, and suddenly you can't breathe because you're thinking about how small you are and how meaningless it all is? Uh I guess.
It's so cruel to let people love you.
All you're doing is promising you'll one day break their hearts.
Cool fire pit.
So it turns out men love safe spaces for women even more than women do.
You gotta read some of these comments.
Queefburglar69 says, "These sexy lady chauffeurs always get me where I need to go.
" That's unambiguous.
The only problem is some of the drivers have been complaining about the new customer base.
The workers are allowed to complain? We gotta tighten up that ship.
Most of the new passengers are perfect gentlemen, but we've found that a growing number are rating our drivers not on performance but on "bangability", which creates an unfair advantage for our "bangable" drivers and creates what some of our more homely employees have dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.
Whoa! Well, our first priority is creating a safe space for women, so if our women don't feel safe in that space, we should replace them with women who do.
Where can we find women who are comfortable around gentlemen? I know.
A gentleman's club.
That's perfect.
To Whale World.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but I pulled some strings and you're in.
I always knew you were a superstar.
Let's get drinks in the new year and work out the deets That's a fast way of saying details for people who don't have time for every detail of the word details.
Vanessa Gekko on line two.
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.
I'm gonna bat her around like a ball of foil.
I know you're excited, but we are still in a very precarious position, and I wonder if foil-ball-batting is the best tack here.
Judah, this is where I live.
Watch and learn.
Hey, we heard BoJack and Kelsey had a great meeting on Jelly Belle.
Gotta tie this up tonight if it's going to happen.
BoJack would love to do the movie, but you're gonna have to work around his Pegasus schedule.
Oh, um That might be tricky.
Then you're gonna have to match his Pegasus quote.
He won't do it for a penny less.
Princess Carolyn Even with a star like BoJack, Kelsey can't get that kind of money.
Well, then, work around his schedule.
You're overplaying your hand, PC, and I'm calling your bluff.
I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko, and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.
That's not fair.
I was clearly establishing a poker metaphor, you just changed it to a game of chicken.
My court.
My rules.
Court? What game are you playing? Bye.
Damn it! Question, am I the faulty bike tire pump I had in seventh grade? Because I just blew this thing wide open.
Talk to me, soldier.
I have been scouring old emails.
I didn't know what I was looking for.
I knew there was something.
And I found it.
Bam! Hot shit on a ham sandwich, this is amazing! Sweet crap on a croissant, Katie's going into labor! Go, I'll take care of this.
Family comes first.
Thank you.
You make me stronger.
Why is my house filled with sexy orcas? It's the Cabracadabra New Year's party.
These are our drivers.
Oh.
Uh, where's Emily? She left.
She said she didn't feel comfortable here.
She certainly didn't feel comfortable paying for the food she ate.
Yeah, okay, BoJack.
I got champagne for my real friends, 'cause that's what you are.
A real friend.
He doesn't want to do your show.
What? BoJack is about to win an Oscar.
Why do you think he would want to do your soon-to-fail sitcom about the further adventures of a carb-faced nobody? Oh, maybe You are not a television star.
You have no talent and I am forgetting your face even as I'm looking at it.
Pack your bags.
Go back to Nowheresville.
Thank you for the champagne.
Best regards, Ana Spanakopita.
Oh, God, the house! I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up Oh, no.
I dropped my phone in a bog.
Something is going on with your brother.
You need to talk to him.
We don't really have the kind of relationship where we talk about things.
Labs prefer to keep things playful.
You know what they say about dogs? Talking to each other is rrruff.
I'm serious, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
And I'm serious that you should drop it.
If something was really wrong, he would tell me about it.
Would he? I know he's your brother, but he's hiding something from you.
Why do you think you know my brother better than I do? Just because you have a shitty relationship with your family doesn't mean every other family has to have drama too.
I wanted to come up here and have a nice time.
This place is an escape for me.
Okay, I'm sorry, I just I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I should not have shouted at you.
I just I need to go for a walk.
Oh, hey.
Hey, is there something going on? Because I know there isn't, but if there is, you would tell me, right? But there's nothing to tell, because nothing bad ever happens on the Labrador Peninsula.
Okay, I think you should sit down.
Why? I need to talk to you.
Sit down.
I will not sit down.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, sit.
Okay.
I got a twisted spleen.
No.
It's not fatal, necessarily.
Everything's gonna be fine.
They still have to run some tests.
But it's going to be fine? Yeah.
Promise me it's going to be fine? You're my big brother.
That means you can't lie to me about this.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you are the best runt of the litter a guy could ask for.
No, don't do this.
But there might come a time Please.
When you're going to have to be the captain.
What is this, a very special episode? What? What do you mean? What happened? It's a no-go on BoJack for Pegasus.
I don't understand, Laura.
I I just wanted you to know.
I did everything I could.
Hey.
Look If you didn't wanna do my movie, you should have just told me.
I do want to do your movie.
Oh, yeah? Why did your agent keep demanding more money? What? The option's expired and I'm screwed.
Ugh! Why did I get my hopes up? Why do I keep letting you get my hopes up? Kelsey, this is a mistake.
It's a mistake I keep making.
Next time, BoJack? Do a girl a favor, don't break her heart by inches.
Do it all at once.
It'll save everyone some time.
Huh? Ten, nine, eight Oh, good, you're still here.
I wanted to get a head start on the 2016 budget.
It'll be a challenge, but assuming BoJack books Pegasus BoJack didn't book Pegasus.
So he's doing the jellybean movie? That fell apart, too.
We're gonna have to cut some costs.
Our social media division is a luxury we can no longer afford.
If things don't perk up the first quarter, we might be looking at broader layoffs.
Do you ever read a room? I'm sorry, is this a bad time? Is midnight on New Year's a bad time? I don't know.
Why don't you run that through your robot analysis protocol? Get back to me once you've assessed the data.
I am not a robot.
I am a human being.
You want to make some cuts? Why don't you cut that stupid beard? Everyone who walks in here thinks this place is run by a homeless person.
I apologize if my appearance or demeanor is unprofessional.
No, you're perfect.
Everybody's perfect except for me.
Go home, Judah.
Would you like me to shave the beard? Just go home, Judah.
Happy New Year, Princess Carolyn.
Hello, little ones.
Mama loves you.
And you.
And you.
And you.
They're so beautiful.
And you, and you, and you.
Rutabaga, we got it.
Yeah? Chuff Hollister is the new Pegasus.
We saved the agency.
That's incredible, honey.
Wow, everything worked out.
You gotta love a happy ending.
[sighs.]
[cell phone rings.]
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh? Perfect day to go outside, not read the trades or talk to anyone in the industry or watch entertainment television or have a gut feeling about the ratings for your television show last night.
Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.
You read the trades.
My heart is in my stomach, my stomach is in my butt, and my butt ran away with the spoon.
That makes sense because your butt is quite a dish.
Can you come over? I need you.
[sighs.]
What the? I ordered a few feel-better pizzas to feel better.
It did not work.
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them, and washed it all down with a "Please, God, make my pain go away" vermouth and ice cream float.
Somehow I feel worse.
That's a real mystery.
My show was terrible.
Why did insist on a mockumentary format? It's already an overused trope now, in 2007.
Hey! Mockumentary is not a trope, it's a device for storytelling.
And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.
Yeah.
Yeah, people! It's not me.
It's the people that are the problem! Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that? That's the spirit.
I'm starting to think this show is the best thing that happened to me.
Really? Yeah.
It made me realize you're the best thing that happened to me, with your sexy cat eyes and your cute little hair curl.
You look like a soft serve strawberry ice cream.
BoJack, we can't.
I'm your agent.
You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.
You're the little plastic table they put in pizza boxes to keep the pizza from getting smushed.
You're Princess Carolyn.
[both moan.]
Don't you break my heart, BoJack Horseman.
What? What? Nothing.
Did you just say something to me? No, I was just being wistful, I guess.
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter? Not everyone is interested in your wist.
Okay, BoJack.
You smell nice.
Thanks, BoJack.
[funky electronic music.]
[Carolyn laughs.]
Okay, gotta go.
I'm about to meet my most important client.
I know you're not really on the phone.
Bye, Mr.
President.
Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.
Should we get dinner, or are you just thinking drinks? I'm not planning on staying long.
Okay.
I'm glad you wanted to meet, because I am so pumped to tell you all about the exciting projects I'm lining up for you.
That won't be necessary.
Once you get your Oscar nom, we'll have our pick.
That's the key.
You think Halle Berry would've been offered Catwoman if she wasn't an Oscar winner? We just gotta find you your Catwoman.
I'm not sure if a Catwoman is really the best thing for my career right now.
Right, well, like I said, we are getting lots of offers.
Listen, Princess Carolyn Signore Horseman! Principessa Carolina! Sandro, how you doing, you handsome devil? To be honest I am, how you say, sweating bull's nets.
You mean sweating bullets? I don't think so.
Sweating bullets.
How does that make the sense? How does sweating bull's nets make sense? I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.
He may try to kiss me.
I prefer kissing cows.
No judgment, just a preference.
I love kissing cows! Don't tell my wife.
I'm kidding! She knows.
She's a cow! And I only kiss her.
[laughs.]
Okay, very good.
Haven't you lived in America for 30 years? Ignore him.
Why are you sweating bullets and/or nets? Ah.
Because there is a restaurant critic here tonight.
Very interesting.
Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.
Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh! One star! You all eat a flat butt! Did you not know there was a critic here? You own this place.
I never see you do anything to help run it.
This place runs itself.
Right, Sandro? Well, my wife and children and therapy man may not agree so much, but if you say so, Signore Horseman.
Even his wife and kids and therapy man agree.
Well, as the Black Guy Pete say, "Tonight's gonna be a good night.
" Please.
Enjoy.
I know you're not happy about what happened with the Kelsey project.
I pushed a little too hard to get you the money you deserve.
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good of an agent, so deals fall apart.
That's a thing that happens when agents are really good.
That's not Moving forward! I know you're not happy with how I handled Ethan Around.
Or didn't handle it.
Bygones! It was because I was busy getting you the Pegasus movie, which I know you did not get, but trust me, you'll see not getting these movies was the best thing that ever happened to you.
Onwards and upwards! Tally ho! To the stars! Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat, I have been very disappointed" Ring! Hello, Your Highness.
It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.
[repeating.]
Oh, fish, oh, fish! [female.]
Who's out there? Are you talking to me? No.
[sighs.]
All right, Pink Lady, think.
[female.]
Are you talking to me? Are you a pink lady? [woman.]
I was a Pink Lady in my high school's production of Grease.
Were you Rizzo? [female.]
No, Jan.
Then don't waste my time.
Now, let us bow our heads and bray.
[all bray.]
[grunts.]
[whispers.]
Yes, right away! So back to what you were Oh, my goodness, what is this? Yeah, what is this? Happy 23 years working together Join me Oh, my God.
Twenty-two-three, 23 years Twenty-three years You're making this up.
Happy 23 years working together Can you believe this? Two plus three equals 23 This is just stream of consciousness.
Twenty-three years working together! Twenty-three years Okay, cool.
Can you believe it, BoJack? It's been almost a quarter of a century.
Talking on the phone pretty much every day, sharing our deepest dreams and secrets, being there for each other through all of it, bosom friends, Anne of Green Gables style.
Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say? You're fired.
Uh Oh.
I can't believe this.
You're firing me? Me? What? No.
You have no idea, everything I do around here! Half the kitchen staff is my family.
No.
Honestly, just I detest you! I hope you rot in the hell! We're headed down a road that You washed-up has-been no-good joke! You are the opposite of an onion, because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.
Well, now you are fired.
Good luck finding another charming first-generation Italian immigrant with this kind of darling accent, who makes equally delightful malapropisms! You, sir, have just cut off your nose and thrown Sprite in your face! I am a classic stereotype that is tough to come by nowadays, because Italians don't emigrate so much to America no more.
Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey! Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke! Avanti, all of you! Andiamo! [laughs nervously.]
So that was weird, huh? Please stop looking at me.
Too bad about Sandro, huh? You're the one who's fired, obviously.
Right.
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining of The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.
But in this version, she's a tub-man, with the comparative strength and agility of a tub! PC.
He's looking for someone to play the Underground Railroad conductor.
Great, but you don't represent me anymore.
Okay, I get it.
I'm fired.
Sheesk.
You're gonna spend a couple days being mad at me, then I'll get you another gig, and you'll be my client again, just like every time.
Can we get past the part where you're mad at me and get to the part where you're stealing General Lee's plutonium to fuel your subterranean steam-punk slave-tram? "It's best, for both of us, if we end this relationship once and for all.
" I'm sorry I screwed up, you don't have to read off the "You take me for granted, made decisions that were against my wishes, and worst of all she's got my globes a-warming!" How did that get in there? What is that? A punch line to a joke from the roast of January Jones.
A global warming joke? It's an important issue.
Here we go.
"Our relationship no longer has any" "January has only gotten hotter and hot" Nope.
Were you at the roast of January Jones? No, but I wrote some jokes in case someone got sick and they needed a backup.
Do you even know January Jones? Why would they call you? I guess I thought that my agent could get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis How did these get out of order? So in the joke, are the globes your balls? And they get warm when you see January Jones? Is that how balls work? I don't know.
It's a work in progress.
Professional integrity! "Our relationship no longer has any professional integrity.
So it's gotta end.
Stand to leave.
" Shouldn't have read that part.
"When you reflect on this, you'll see it's best for both of us.
Exit restaurant.
" Goddamn it.
Wow, that was I don't know what that was.
Hey! Where are you going? Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita? This has nothing to do with Ana.
Here you go, sir.
I'll get it! You two are b'thumping.
Now you do whatever she says? Is that what's happening? No.
No, you're not b'thumping or no, you're not doing whatever she says? I'm not doing whatever she says.
So you are b'thumping.
I understand from context what you mean, but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.
I'll get it! You don't have to do everything your little falafel pocket tells you to.
You screwed up! Once! In 23 years! I'll get 'em.
All these years I carried you, when no one wanted to work with you.
I still managed to get you jobs.
And then you would flake, or sabotage them, or get wrapped up in some crisis or emergency or vague sadness.
Everyone told me to dump you my bosses, film execs, directors, they all told me you were washed up, a nobody, a has-been, a joke, too portly for TV.
Too portly for TV? Who said that? It doesn't matter.
It does.
Who said it? Luis Guzman.
Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV? You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.
I no longer have to lug your talentless, self-centered, self-sabotaging, dead-weight carcass of faded talent around my neck.
Hey.
Thank you for firing me.
I'm gonna go pour myself a little celebratory potato juice, because this is the best goddamn thing that's ever happened to me.
Hey! Hey! Hey! [groans.]
Ha, ha! I'll get it.
You do not talk to me like that and walk away.
Oh, no? What's happening? This is so weird.
I'm walking away, even though you told me not to.
Right, I don't work for you anymore.
Hey! Excuse me, Mr.
Horseman? Not now.
We have a slight problem in the kitchen.
Where is everybody? That's the problem.
They all quit.
The kitchen's backed up with orders.
No one's getting food.
And the critic is growing very impatient.
Writing that down Just do what you normally do.
But there's no chef.
Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.
But I don't want to be a chef.
I want to sing Kidding.
I'm actually just happy being a waiter.
I'm not my job.
A lot of people think that You're the chef! Start cheffing! Oh.
[giggling.]
[murmuring.]
What? Fifty teeth? Get out of here.
Let me see.
Ahh Would you look at that.
You're thrilled to have me out of your life? I was such a burden all those years.
Can I close my mouth now? Know what I think? Don't wanna hear it.
You like being there to rescue me.
I close my mouth, okay? Nobody cares! Okay Nope, I'm still counting.
You like it when I'm a mess.
Because it makes you feel good about yourself.
Guess what? I never asked for that.
You ask all the time.
You have never not been asking me to rescue you.
"Princess Carolyn, help me! I slept with the gaffer's wife and now he's not lighting me properly.
Princess Carolyn, I threw up on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.
Princess Carolyn, why am I such a big stupid asshole?" Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.
Oh, that's abuse? "BoJack, you're such a big, stupid asshole.
BoJack, why were you even in the bounce house, dummy? BoJack, you wasted my thirties!" I never said you wasted my thirties.
Didn't have to, you're always saying it.
And I don't like being around you, because I feel bad.
You make me feel bad.
So this isn't about me being a bad agent.
It's about a lot of things.
Where are you going? Away.
[sighs.]
Hey, listen, man.
I don't wanna get in the middle of this, it's none of my business, but I just have to say I love that sweater.
Can you give it to me? What? No.
I held my mouth open a really long time.
What does that have to do? You're not being fair, to me or Princess Katniss.
Who? Your friend.
You've forgotten her already? Typical BoSchwack.
That's enough out of you.
It's all right, you're gonna get through this.
You're gonna get through this.
[female.]
Are you okay? Are you okay? You've been in there a long time.
[female.]
I left for a while and came back.
Just so you know, this wasn't an easy decision.
This is the ladies' room! [female.]
What's going on out there? Are you watching a movie? I agonized over this.
Ask Ana.
Oh.
So you did talk about it with Ana.
Yeah.
I respect her opinion.
[shouts.]
Paws not claws! Paws not claws! Hey! Ow! God, you're strong.
[BoJack groans.]
This is exactly the kind of unprofessionalism I'm talking about.
You want to talk about professionalism? Yes, I do.
But not here.
[shivers.]
You say you want professionalism? Bullshit.
You want a mommy you can slide your dick in.
I can want that and also want professionalism.
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries, is that too much to ask? Is there a single woman you've worked with who you haven't tried to groggily thrust yourself into? Is it any wonder I don't want to be around you? All you do is tell me I'm a terrible person.
Please, you're such a self-pitying masochist, I could say ten nice things and one mean thing, you would only hear the one mean thing.
I'd love it if you said ten nice things to me.
I can say nice things.
Ready when you are.
Does self-pitying masochist count, or are we starting from scratch? Okay, one I'm freezing my whiskers off.
You have a natural charisma.
You hesitated, that means it's a lie.
Two, you are loved by millions.
That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.
I got this.
I got this.
Pre-heat oven? Where's the pre-heat button? Excuse me? Waiter? Where are my family's double-fudge cheese pies? I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.
Then who's our waiter? Uh, you're the waiter now.
Ta-da! I can't be a waiter.
I have a very important business meeting tomorrow.
You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes! Okay.
Who gets these soy balls and onion cubes? Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.
You got it, boss.
Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.
So I'm a clown to you? Like Joe Pesci in Home Alone? [laughs.]
You recognize you're being impossible, right? I don't know how you put up with me.
I didn't put up with you, BoJack.
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.
Or the bracelet you bought me for my 38th birthday.
Or when my dad died and you came to the funeral with me and held my hand.
I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand? Did you ever love me? At all? I don't I'm not You know that I don't do the whole love thing.
Either you end up hurting someone or they hurt you.
So, what's the point? Yeah.
Ugh.
This sucks.
Ow.
I did this to myself.
I do this to myself.
Why do I do this to myself? I don't know.
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires, you just run from fire to fire and don't really think about [screams.]
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef! I want to be not on fire! We gotta put out that fire! I hate Mondays! [groans.]
I figured out how to pre-heat the oven.
This night has been a disaster.
The good news is I got my kid to prep my important meeting at work.
The bad news is all the customers went home.
They didn't like the screaming and felt like their food was a little too "on fire".
It's called a char, dumbshits.
The critic's still here.
Oh, oh, oh! She still wants her mushroom risotto.
I don't know how to make risotto.
I know how.
What are you doing? No, go home.
You're right.
What am I doing? All right.
Good luck.
[deep breath.]
Keep driving, keep driving Girl, don't turn that car around Break your pattern Of needing to fix other people Just keep on driving away Ugh.
Who do they write these songs for? Don't go back to the restaurant Princess Carolyn Just keep driving away Ugh.
[music stops.]
Goddamn it.
How should I know? Do I look like an expert in cooking oils? We have to choose! We're running out of time.
Olive.
You wanna use olive oil.
What are you doing? Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.
Fine.
This isn't one of those things where you save my ass so I feel obligated to give you your job back.
I know you have no sense of obligation to me.
Ooh, slam.
I'm sorry, I'd rather not get involved.
Can I get you some more water? Mmm.
You look lovely.
It's a great blouse.
Mom, I wanna go home.
This is a very important night for the restaurant.
How are we coming on the sales meeting? Did you get the big conference room? Winslow wants the big conference room for his presentation to corporate.
You get back on that phone and you get me that big room.
Okay, Mom.
The secret is stirring continuously.
Right, so that's the secret.
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.
Thanks for your help.
Sure.
How do you know how to do this? Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.
She had a little trouble bending her elbow too much.
Glug, glug.
So unless I wanted us to be on the street, I had to cover for her, a lot.
That rich family loved Italian food and champagne fountains.
And cocaine.
And private jets.
And screaming at each other.
"Who threw my cocaine in the champagne fountain?" So standard rich people stuff? I guess.
How come you never told me that? I did.
Oh.
It's okay.
I know you never remember anything.
That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.
I went to see Marv.
You were at the desk in front of his office.
I thought you were cute and you said, "It's good to see you again.
" Oh.
So I guess we'd met before.
That was the third time we met.
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.
You were passed out in the yard, covered in tapioca pudding.
I hosed you down, dragged you inside, covered you with a blanket.
Really? I don't remember that.
Shocker.
So you've gone from daughter of a maid to head of your own company.
Well, the company's not doing so hot.
Don't try to guilt me.
It's not your fault.
Turns out being an agent and running an agency are two different skills.
It's like asking a really delicious tomato to make you a tomato sandwich.
How's a tomato gonna make you a sandwich? He's got no arms.
You'll figure it out.
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter? Why are you an agent at all if it makes you so miserable? Because I'm good at it.
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.
Just 'cause you're good at something doesn't mean you have to do it.
I'm good at driving sober, but I don't relish the opportunity.
But what else would I do? Who else would I be? I do love you, by the way.
I mean, as much as I'm capable of loving anyone.
Which is never enough.
I'm sorry.
Ta-da! Well, it is truly how should I put this? Wonderful.
So you'll give Elefante a good review? Oh, no, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.
At one point, a waiter ran through the restaurant on fire.
Unfortunately, you will be receiving my lowest rating: four hundred and twelve stars, out of a possible a billion.
A billion stars? Yes, that's the rubric I use on SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.
tumblr.
com.
Oh, God, get out.
[exclaims.]
I assure you the animated GIFs with which I describe this encounter shall be scathing.
Mom! I just touched base with Rooney, re, Winslow.
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.
Perfect! This is the meeting where we finally convince the big boys to let us get babies addicted to vaping! Yes! Corporation! [all cheer.]
How about a drink? I could drink.
I don't think I can.
I'm heading out.
I got pretty badly burnt earlier and in a lot of pain.
I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.
[groans.]
Ha, ha! What's the second time we met? A taping of Horsin' Around.
Which episode? The one where Olivia put too much detergent in the washing machine.
[BoJack.]
Nancy Reagan was the guest star.
That woman was the real actor in the family.
[Carolyn.]
I just started working for Marv.
I went backstage to introduce myself.
And then what happened? You told me you were too tired pretending to be nice all night, and I needed to leave you alone.
Oh.
I'm a real jerk, huh? Yeah, but you're honest, straightforward, not fake nice and don't beat around the bush.
Your heart is tender, so you protect it from people, but sometimes you open up a wall and it's incredible.
You're doing the best you can, considering your asshole parents.
You have great taste in art, and that pink spot on your nose is just adorable.
How many nice things was that, about ten? Yeah, just about.
Okay, one more.
You let me help you tonight because you knew I needed it.
You did it for me, which was very sweet.
Thanks.
You're a good friend to me.
BoJack Yeah? Are we friends? Yeah.
I mean, I think we are.
Or I think we can be.
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you Please don't leave me.
Princess Carolyn Please.
I can turn this around, I just need more time.
We're in a fragile period, still finding our feet.
Just give me six months and then you can go.
I promise, I'll never ask anything from you again, but please, give me six months.
Sorry, I left my coat here.
[whistling a tune.]
[waiter.]
I got it.
[continues whistling.]
So? What do you think? No.
Ladies and gentlemen, to announce this year's Oscar nominees Mr.
Peanutbutter! Mr.
Peanutbutter! Mr.
Peanutbutter? Hello! Here I am, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
That's my name and I am here.
Okay, the nominees.
Nominees for Oscar.
Who are the nominees? Well, as I used to say on Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out, let's find out.
For Best Actor, the nominees are.
Jurj Clooners for The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.
Bread Poot for City of AIDS.
Colin Firth for First Things Firth.
The Colin Firth Story.
Michael Fassbender for I want to say Bill Gates? And BoJack Horseman for Secretariat.
Whoa.
BoJack, you just got nominated for an Oscar.
You're an Oscar nominee.
How do you feel? I feel I-I feel I feel the same.
It happened again.
Why do I keep thinking things will make me happy? What is wrong with me? BoJack, don't do this.
Don't fetishize your own sadness.
Uh Oh, God, I'm drowning.
I feel like I'm drowning.
BoJack, listen.
When I was 17, I snuck out to a fraternity party.
The roads were icy and I swerved into the lake.
I came to underwater.
It was dark and cold, and I didn't even know which way was up.
I thought for sure I was going to drown.
And then I noticed when I opened my mouth, the air bubbles floated up, and that's how I knew which way to swim.
That is a terrifying story.
BoJack, when you find yourself lost and disoriented and underwater and you don't know which way is up, it's important to breathe.
I don't deserve this.
I'm not a best actor.
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.
That's literally the only thing they're about.
No.
All this means is that you're one of the special people.
I saw it the first time I met you.
You must have known it all your life.
And all your life, people told you that you were wrong, that you weren't special, that you were just like everybody else.
But now, the special people are saying, "You were right, BoJack.
You were right.
" I was right.
I am one of the special people.
Yes.
What are we doing just sitting here? I just got nominated for an Oscar.
We gotta party like it's 1982, the year Prince released 1999.
Whoo-hoo! BoJack, your complimentary Rolex is here.
BoJack, giant chocolate Oscar's here.
Famous DJ David Gu-etta is at the door.
Free Tesla's here, Boj.
They want to know if they can park it in your driveway.
No.
Tell them I want my free Tesla parked in my goddamn living room.
I'm BoJack! Yeah, now we're doing it! Look at us partying.
BoJack, you got another delivery.
Someone sent a nerd? Hi.
You get a load of this chili cheese fountain? Grab a handful of beans and go to town.
Hey, this is all really something.
But I actually just came because I heard about the nomination and I wanted to make sure you're okay.
That's a funny way of saying congratulations.
But not funny "ha-ha", more like funny Doonesbury.
I know how this kind of thing can sometimes send you spinning.
"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy? Will anything make me happy? I'm an empty husk.
" That kind of thing.
Well, thank you for that, but I'm actually doing great.
I direct your attention to the aforementioned chili cheese fountain! It's too bad I'm not managing your social campaign anymore, because this party would make a great Snapchat story.
You are not gonna make me guilty about leaving Princess Carolyn.
I'm not here to make you feel guilty.
Like I said Honestly, I don't even know what you're doing over there.
Tweeting for celebrities? Well, actually, I don't When I met you, you were so cool and interesting Uh, I was never cool.
You used to actually care about shit.
What happened? I don't know, BoJack.
Maybe caring about shit got old.
Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me and sending death threats to my house, and all my friends thinking I'm annoying, and getting in fights with my husband, and seeing little refugee boys die in hospital bombings.
It's exhausting and I can't do it.
If that makes me a bad person, then I'm sorry that I'm not the "cool, interesting girl.
" I never said you were a bad person.
I just said it's not you.
And you know it's not you.
Oh, and this party is you? Who are all these people? These are my friends.
Name one of them.
Tes-ley.
You're just looking at the Tesla.
I don't know why it's so hard for you to believe that I could be happy.
I'm not like you, okay? I don't fetishize my own sadness.
I don't fetishize my own sadness.
Sure.
You don't know anything about me.
Hey! I know that you can tweet for a living in a house in Beverly Hills that your husband bought, or you can think you're better than everyone, but you can't do both.
I don't think I'm better than everyone.
And again, I say, sure.
You know what's gonna happen? You're gonna win that Oscar, and you're gonna go up on that stage and give your little speech, and then you're gonna go home.
And you're gonna be so miserable, you'll want to kill yourself.
And you're gonna have nobody left to stop you.
Hey, it's BoJack! BoJack! BoJack! No one's gonna be there when I kill myself? Listen to that chanting, Diane.
The chanting don't lie.
There's going to be plenty of people around when I kill myself.
BoJack! Tell your readers that BoJack was sleeping.
He didn't even know they were announced today.
Okay.
Goodbye, Heather.
Hey, Ana, can I ask you something? Of course, darling.
So, if I win the Oscar "When" you win the Oscar.
Right.
But after that, what's gonna happen to us? What do you mean? What we have.
It's more than just an Oscar campaign, right? I need to go.
What? There's work to be done.
We got the nomination, but now, the real battle begins.
Enjoy your party.
Stop worrying about the future.
Come on, buddy! Come on! Mr.
Peanutbutter! Thank God you're okay.
Better than okay.
I'm wonderful.
Thanks to you, you wonderful man.
When you said my name this morning, you changed my life.
About that Hey, did you see Erica here? She was looking for you earlier, with her good eye.
Her other eye was looking to the stars.
BoJack, I need to talk to you.
Yeah? What's going on, buddy? Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news.
Raven on a wire.
A gloomy portent, precariously perched.
And, as the sun sets, so does it spread its deathly shadow across the just and unjust of the outdoor seating area of the California Pizza Kitchen.
Mm-hmm! And what better way to view such disquieting omens than through these gorgeous floor-to-ceiling windows? Yeah.
Wow! They really make regular windows look like shit.
I can't look out the window while lying on the floor? No, thank you, regular window! Tell me a little about your company.
Well, it started as a safe space for women.
Ooh! Then, it became a safe space for women and men.
Oh! Now, it's more of a safe-ish space for women Mm-hmm.
And a really safe space for men to look at women I hear you.
While also being driven around by them.
Wow! Something for everyone.
Demand is skyrocketing.
That's why we need a bigger office space.
You come to work, clock in, you put sugar in your coffee, and watch it slowly disappear into nothingness.
But the sugar doesn't know why.
Sugar didn't ask to be born.
Is he okay? He recently found out that his brother's sick.
Oh.
I'm so sorry, but you know what else is sick? These hardwood floors.
Ooh! Did you hear that, Mr.
Peanutbutter? Losing BoJack was a blow.
There's no way to sugarcoat it, even if I were generally good at sugarcoating things, which I'm not.
You know, I wish cats really did have nine lives.
It would make me feel better about how much I'm screwing up this one.
You're not screwing up your life.
Sometimes I feel like, if I could start everything over, knowing what I know now, I'd do it all right this time.
But other times I think No, I wouldn't.
As you all know, things have been rough, and, unfortunately, we have to scale back our staff.
Mainly, you.
Are you firing me? In a sense, yes.
But, in another sense, I'm promoting you to a position of finding a job somewhere else.
Yeah.
I don't think I ever thanked you for giving me this job in the first place.
It was an honor to work with you.
You were the worst social media coordinator this company ever had.
Are you sure you need surgery? Can't you get a second opinion? Second opinion? You know there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.
I could ask him twice if it'd make you feel better.
Nothing could make me feel better right now.
Not even an amazing career opportunity.
Hold on, I'm getting another call.
I've got to take this.
It could be an amazing career opportunity.
Hello? Mr.
Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp, awards show producer, with a career opportunity that is good.
This isn't a great time, Shep.
Could you call back? Absolutely not.
The Oscar nomination announcement is in seven days and we don't have a host.
Sadly, Jimmy Fallon just broke his face.
What? Halloween in January? What a crazy concept! I can't believe it! I mean, what is this? Barry Gibb would be like I'm going in! No.
First, I gotta get a selfie with this thing.
I'm Jimmy Fallon Und you are our first choice after our first "first choice" got hit by a bus.
You're our second "first choice.
" What do you say? Ooh, a job like that? You want a fully present presenter to present.
And I don't know if I've got the pep in my step to take that show where it needs to go, you know? I've got a real pepless step, Shep.
Okay, well, let me know, because if you don't want to do it, we'll probably just post the list of nominees online or something.
It's really not that big of a deal.
Hey, sorry about that.
Just got a call from the Oscars.
They want me to host They want you to host the Oscars? Nomination announcement.
But I don't think I have it in me right now.
Are you kidding? You gotta take that gig.
Really? Mr.
Peanutbutter what did Nana Peanutbutter always say? "Always take every opportunity that comes your way because opportunities are like sneezes from God, and when God sneezes, you can't say 'God bless you' to God, so instead you have to take the opportunity.
I'm cold.
Will you pass me that blanket?" Boy, that old gal had something for everything, didn't she? I know you're worried about me, but sitting around the house worrying isn't going to help anyone.
Okay, but you'll call me when you get out of the surgery, right? I'm not gonna let my phone leave my sight.
Of course.
And now, I've got something new to live for.
My little brother, telling the whole world who got an Oscar! Nomination.
We are minutes away.
Shep, release the envelope.
Copy that.
Releasing the envelope.
It's go time.
It's go time.
Are you ready, Brother Pricewater? Of course, Brother Housecoopers.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, we'd like to invite you to the stage.
It's here! The golden envelope.
Hmm Herr Peanutbutter? Okay.
Oh, my phone.
What should I do with it, Todd? Maybe you should hold it.
Uh-huh.
No, I'll take it with me.
All right.
No, you hold it.
Sure thing, yeah.
No, put it in my jacket pocket.
Right here.
Okay.
Oh, no, it's a fake pocket.
Tricked again! Todd, it's ringing.
This is it.
Oh, no, my phone! Oh, no, I kicked it, right through that doorway into the hallway! Now, other people are kicking it and it's sliding across the floor! Okay, this is getting absurd.
Let's get that phone! Mr.
Peanutbutter, you have been invited to the stage! Excuse me! Hey! Sorry.
If you could just My phone! I'm coming to get you! That way! Come on, phone.
Just stop! Hello? Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I just, um I wanted to give you a chance to say goodbye Oh, no.
to my twisted spleen.
Because it was successfully removed from my body! Oh, my God, that's incredible! Now, get out there and announce those Oscars! Nominations.
You got it, buddy.
Okay.
Now, where's the the Uh-oh.
Could've sworn it was right here.
Oh! Oh! There you are.
You need to get on stage.
Yes, just as soon as you give me that backup envelope, please and por favor.
What back-up envelope? There is no back-up envelope.
That was a test and you passed.
Wunderbar.
Now, let's get you out there.
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage, to announce the nominations.
Just as soon as I Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper? Bradley Cooper? We love him for some reason.
Where? Let's go, Todd.
Oh, God, what do we do? It's okay.
We just need to come up with all the nominees ourselves.
But I haven't even seen all the movies.
Todd, nobody has.
That's not how they give out awards.
But Time for talk is over.
Now's the time for action.
And by "action," I mean talking about these 24 categories until we've settled on a list of nominees.
You need to tell me right now, are you in or out? Well, when you put it that way, I guess you can call me high-waisted denim, because, right now, I am very in.
Let's do this.
What did you think of Frieda Pinto? Are you kidding me? Anybody could do what she did.
"Don't take my baby.
I'll give you all my Bitcoins!" Wow.
That is good.
Okay, for Best Picture, what about Avatar? That was a good movie.
True, but did that come out this year? I feel like I just saw it.
Well, there's no way to know for sure.
Let's just throw it on the list.
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis down for anything? He's always there.
Good catch! I'll add him.
Daniel Day-Lewis.
Okay.
We need one more nominee for Best Actor.
Oh, what about BoJack? His performance in Secretariat was as thoughtful and self-aware as we've ever seen him.
Besides, he's our friend.
Is he? Whoa! I am surprised to hear you say that, Todd Chavez.
Let's dig into that.
We have time.
I don't think we do.
You're supposed to be announcing these, like, now.
There is always time to talk about our feelings.
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say, "There's always time to talk about feelings, because feelings are the ceilings of our hearts, and a leaky feeling ceiling leads to a flood of blood.
And I'm cold.
Will you pass me that blanket?" Well, I guess I'm just tired of BoJack walking all over everybody and still getting everything he wants.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I think the important thing to remember here is that BoJack is a damaged individual, struggling against a sea of demons, many self-created, but still all too real.
Getting this nomination from the two friends he loves the most you and also me would really mean a lot to him.
Okay.
But did you really think he was that good in the movie? Oh, I haven't seen it.
It seemed long.
And the final nominee for Best Picture is Avatar.
Well, those are all the nominations.
I will not be taking any questions.
Goodbye.
I must go.
I gotta say, we picked some top-notch noms.
You know it! Boy, was I glad when we got out of that theater, though.
I know.
So many questions.
"Oh, what the hell happened? Why were you reading off that napkin? Why are you guys running?" They have their nominees.
What more could they want? You know what's crazy? We saved the day today, and no one will ever even know.
Hey, we'll know.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, we know what you did.
Oh, boy.
So, the good news is, my brother's surgery was a success.
And the bad news is, you're not nominated for an Oscar.
And the other good news is that each breath is a gift and it is a joy to live.
What? We are so lucky we get to be alive.
No, before that.
Oh, I didn't tell you.
My brother's been sick.
No, I don't care about your brother.
First of all, manners.
Second of all, I think if you met him, you'd actually really hit it off.
Imagine me but with less "in your face" cool guy attitude.
Did you say I'm not nominated for an Oscar? Oh A lot of people are mighty steamed, but I feel like what everyone's overlooking here is, I got most of the categories dead-on.
That's pretty amazing, and I am not getting enough credit for that.
Did you know that Avatar came out in 2009? I'm not nominated for an Oscar.
No.
But you know what they say.
"It's an honor just to be nominated.
" Oh, wait.
So, I'm just like everybody else.
I know you're upset, but whatever you do, please don't get mad at Todd.
Why would I get mad at Todd? Exactly.
This is totally my fault.
He didn't even want to nominate you.
What? With the gift of hindsight, I see now how that might have made you even more upset.
But I realized something today, when my brother called from the hospital, and I think it's gonna make you feel a lot better.
What? What is it? None of this matters.
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.
As a partner in the company, I am prepared to forgo my salary for the next three months, but even then, we're going to need some sort of miracle.
What are we doing? What was the point of any of this? I wasted everyone's time for six months.
Soon, I'll get some offer from one of the big five agencies that I can't say no to, and I'll go back to being another cog in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker that is this industry.
Is that the best I can hope for? Not necessarily.
Although, there is one thing I should probably mention.
What is it, Judah? Maybe this is an opportunity to live one of your other eight lives.
Yeah, maybe.
It's been a pleasure working with you, Judah.
I found it to be an above average experience.
Please forgive me for getting emotional.
Rye, wheat, or sourdough? Can I get it on stale? And then, he said, I fetishize my own sadness.
What did you think was gonna happen? Why did you go there? I don't know.
Did you ask for water? No.
They're not supposed to give us water unless we ask.
Don't they know there's a drought? You want to send the water back? No, I want the water.
I just I went to BoJack's house to congratulate him.
I'm not trying to pick fights.
Well, you don't have to see him at all if you don't want to.
It's not like you work for him anymore.
Is he right? Am I a bad person? Who cares what he thinks? Why do you have this weird fixation with him? I do not have a fixation, Roxy.
I worry about him.
Okay.
And last year? When you came back from Cordovia and needed a place to crash? Oh, you could have stayed with me, or any of your other friends, but you went right to his house.
Did you ever ask yourself why? They're filling everyone's glasses.
This is insane.
Oh, my God.
What do you care? Hey, excuse me? Excuse me? Do you know you're breaking the law by giving everybody water? It's okay.
I want the water.
Yeah, we all want water.
That's not the point.
In the state of California, it is illegal for a restaurant to serve people water before they ask for it.
There is a drought.
Sit down! We're thirsty! You know, this is what's wrong with society.
Diane Nobody thinks about the world outside themselves.
So, how you doing? You still working at that place? Hello? Hi, Ralph.
It's Princess Carolyn.
Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn, I never thought I'd hear from you again.
I might have some free time coming up.
I was wondering if you might want to get a drink.
Okay.
So, the night I met you after I said goodbye, the craziest thing happened.
Okay? I was walking back to my car, when all of a sudden, this woman Oh.
Tripped on a cobblestone, twisted her ankle, and tumbled into my arms.
What? Turns out, she was a ballerina, and she didn't speak a word of English.
So, I rushed her to the hospital, and long story short, we eloped.
Oh.
I moved to Russia, and I'm totally messing with you.
None of that's true.
What? I would love to see you again.
I think about you all the time.
Really? Yeah.
How about this Saturday? It's a date.
Ana? Uh, no, it's just me, giant chocolate Oscar guy.
I'm here to pick up the giant chocolate Oscar.
My boss really wants our product to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.
You know, to maintain the integrity of the giant chocolate Oscar.
I don't care.
Take it.
You've reached Ana Spanakopita.
How did you get this number? Explain yourself.
Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.
Please call me back.
I need you.
Ana, please.
This is BoJack, by the way.
Horseman.
Hey! Todd! Where you been? Oh, hi.
You were in Ojai? No, I was just saying hi.
Well, why not go to Ojai, huh? You and me? I could use an escape, couldn't you? It's not really a good time.
Todd, I need this.
You're my best friend and I need you.
Don't leave me now.
Don't be like everybody else.
I'm not leaving you.
I just Besides, I think you owe me, right? After what you did? What I did? Come on, Todd.
I know.
Mr.
Peanutbutter told me everything.
Everything? Even told you, when I was a kid, I used to bang on my butt like a bongo drum when I got out of the bath? What? Todd-o, me and Todd-o Bath time come Make Todd shiny and clean Mm, no, not-not about that.
So, he didn't tell you everything.
Did he tell you about the time I counted to a million? One, two, three, four, five, six No, stop.
But I was just getting to the good part! What? Seven? He told me you didn't want to nominate me for an Oscar.
Oh, that.
What the hell, man? After everything I've done for you? What are you talking about? Oh, I don't know.
Letting you live here for free for six years? Giving you food, indulging you in your little projects and adventures and stories about how you used to bang on your butt like a bongo drum? I let you turn my house into your company's headquarters for the last month.
Yeah, but that's not because you're my friend.
That's because you felt bad about Emily.
You know about Emily? I think I know.
Why? What do you think I know? I mean, I know what I think, but I don't know if the thing that I think is the thing that you think I know.
You know? So, you know I had sex with Emily.
You had sex with Emily?! Well, what did you think? I don't know! Not that! I just knew something sketchy happened.
I thought maybe you gave her one of your weird monologues about how sad you are, and it bummed her out! Todd, I'm sorry, all right? I screwed up.
I know I screwed up.
I don't know why Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes! You can't keep doing this! You can't keep doing shitty things, and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay! You need to be better! I know.
And I'm sorry, okay? I was drunk, and there was all this pressure with the Oscar campaign.
But now Now that it's over, I No! No, BoJack, just stop.
You are all the things that are wrong with you.
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs, or any of the shitty things that happened to you in your career, or when you were a kid.
It's you.
All right? It's you.
Fuck, man.
What else is there to say?
[angelic music playing.]
[harp playing.]
[takes deep breath.]
Good morning, morning.
[humming.]
Good morning, sun.
Good morning, trees.
Good morning, busy buzzy bees.
Good morning, Sarah Lynn.
Good to see you, Sarah Lynn.
The tulips and chrysanthemums are really coming in.
Good morning, handsome garden ants.
I like the way you plant my plants.
Your flowers make my feelings dance.
I like your handsome planter pants.
Goddamn it! Why won't you? [groans.]
It's okay.
Sarah Lynn, you are calm, you are thin.
Your skin is so soft, it's like you murdered a baby and stole its skin.
Your skin is "murdered-baby" soft.
Okay.
Blueberry, goji berry, flax, chia, shark fin, and white rhino horn.
Sober, so good.
[phone vibrating.]
Oh.
BoJack? Hey, Sarah Lynn.
You wanna party? Oh, thank God.
Yes! [grunting.]
Okay, hand me the aÃ§ai.
Is that how you pronounce it? Who knows? They should really just call them "overpriced blueberries for douchebags.
" Ow.
How's life? Well, the truth is that Didn't catch that, but everything's cool? No.
In fact, I've never felt so alone Sorry, missed it! You should learn to talk louder, dude! Oh, hey, bummer about you getting the nomination, but then, it turning out that you didn't get the nomination.
It was big news yesterday.
Yeah, I got royally screwed, know who was there for me? No one, because everyone's an asshole and the whole world sucks balls.
Anyway, thanks for having me over.
I'm with you, man.
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.
Why would I make my body a temple? I've been to Temple.
Temple is super boring.
What do you say we go on an epic bender? Yes! Let's get higher than a stilt walker's dick! That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get some booze and drugs.
We can clear out my bank account.
I got nothing left I care about.
What do you mean "get"? This whole house is booze and drugs.
Here.
Yogurt-covered raisins? Nope.
Vicodin-covered Vicodin.
Oh! LSD.
Wow.
Yah! Crystal meth.
Ha-ha! Ee-yah! [snorting.]
Cocaine No! That's drywall.
Ugh! Where the hell did I hide the cocaine? Oh, yeah, I also told the liquor store to deliver.
[grunting.]
To nine months of sobriety.
To life and being done with it! [both laughing.]
Okay, okay.
What about this one? Remember when Erika Eleniak guest starred as Goober's cousin from out of town, and Brad had a boner for the whole episode? What? No.
You can totally see it in every scene.
Cold open, boner! Act one, boner! Commercial break "Hello, we're from the Wheaties corporation!" Back to boners! Okay, we'll put it on the list.
We gotta watch that one.
What about the one where the writers made Joelle dress up like a pumpkin, and the whole episode was fat jokes, so then Joelle got an eating disorder? Everything was so much simpler back then.
She had to go to a clinic.
She missed, like, five episodes.
We didn't know how good we had it.
We got to come to work and have fun every day, and we weren't worried about our legacy or awards.
Because buildings are supposed to be rectangles, goddamn it! Wait, what were we talking about? We were talking about Horsin' Around.
Then, you had to go pee.
Then, you came back covered in toilet paper and pretended to be a mummy.
Then, you took it all off because you decided Egypt was stupid, especially pyramids, because you think triangle buildings are, and I quote, "gauche as shit.
" That does sound like me, but I don't remember any of that.
I must have blacked out.
Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for and I said, "You're sitting on the pizza, Mr.
President.
" Whoa! I think I just had another one.
Another what? Pizza? No, blackout.
The thing we were just talking about.
Try to keep up here.
Oh Boom! Boner! Pay up! What did I tell you? That's not a boner.
It's a shadow.
Well, I think we all learned a valuable lesson today about the Armenian genocide.
The Armenian genocide was too much, man! [audience laughing.]
All right! Next episode.
Why can't life be like it was on Horsin' Around? All our issues conveniently settled in 22 hilarious minutes.
You know, it's amazing that it's legal for kids to be actors.
How is that not child labor? I didn't know what I was signing up for.
I was three.
This is getting me depressed.
Let's do something fun.
Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass? The planetarium! You get crazy high in the parking lot, then you go in and get your mind blown by all the trippy galaxies and shit.
That sounds stupid.
I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.
[snorting.]
No, no, no! That was drywall.
Jesus, we have to start marking our drugs more clearly.
Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.
Whoo! [male voice.]
It was just so hard.
Wha? What the? I was stuck in a terrifying cycle of drinking, lifting my head up, drinking, lifting my head up, drinking, lifting my head up.
Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogs telling boring stories about themselves? Jesus! Are we at a 12-step meeting? Now, you're a detective? Last night, you couldn't even solve the mystery of where the toilet is.
So, all our partying was an elaborate trick just to get me to go sober? No, Detective Pukes in the Washing Machine.
You're here because I couldn't leave you alone in my house, and I had to come today.
Gotta get my nine-month chip.
Chip? We've been wasted for 31 hours? That's no reason for me to not get my chip.
That's literally exactly the reason you shouldn't get your chip.
Nowhere in the 12 steps does it say to not drink.
That's not actually one of the steps.
Loophole.
Take a swig.
If you have to listen to losers talk about their shitty sober lives, it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.
And I realized people don't change because they want to change.
They change because they have to change.
Oh, God.
Boo! Oh, booing is generally frowned upon here.
How else am I supposed to express how boring these stories are? [speaking slowly.]
My name is Simon and I'm an alcoholic.
[all.]
Hi, Simon.
My rock bottom was when I actually woke up under a rock.
Can't get lower than that.
Come on! You people call yourself drunks? Most of this is stuff I do on a daily basis completely sober.
Trust me, pal, we've done some awful things.
One time, I didn't want my friend to move out, so I used character actress Ann Dowd to help me sabotage his hip-hopera.
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.
You so-called drunks want something to feel shitty about? BoJack, maybe we should go.
I got somethin' for ya.
Whoa.
My name is BoJack.
[all.]
Hi, BoJack.
Oh, like you didn't know? Anyway, I once went all the way down to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew, and she had a young daughter, Penny.
Penny Carson.
That's her real name.
You can look her up.
I don't care.
And first, I tried to sleep with the mom, but she said no.
Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.
[all groaning.]
Then, the mom walked in on me trying to sleep with the daughter, and I was like, "Oopsie-doopsie! Exit stage right!" Oh, God.
The worst part is, I don't even know what happened after I left.
Did I ruin the family? Did I scar that little girl for life? I don't know.
I'll never know.
And that's just, like, one of a billion things that I have going through my head all the time.
So, anyone got a better story than that? Wow.
Didn't think so, bitches.
Where's my trophy, or chip, or whatever? [screams.]
[car horn honking.]
Whoa! [screams.]
[tires squealing.]
That was impressive, BoJack.
I've never seen them cancel an AA meeting because everyone got bummed out before.
Uh, what are you talking about? You told everyone about that Penny chick.
Then, you went on and on about how you're never going to change.
Then, you chased the slug around, threatening to pour salt on his head.
I talked about Penny? Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.
[tires squealing.]
[loud crash.]
Most of us aren't as proud of it as you seem to be.
I'm not proud.
I feel really terrible that I might have really messed that girl up.
Oh, she's fine.
I looked her up on Facebook.
She's going to Oberlin, likes Thai food and the smell of a fire on the first really cold day of winter.
That doesn't mean anything.
Everyone likes the smell of fire on the first cold day of winter.
You know, I used to feel just like you before I got into this "12 steps" thing.
They taught me how to make amends.
You just say you're sorry for the things you did and you get a clean slate.
So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.
Then, you just make amends again.
It's a never-ending cycle, where you always end up feeling good about yourself.
[man.]
No! You know what? This may be the nitrous and bath salts talking, but I want to do some more nitrous and bath salts.
[tires squealing.]
[crash.]
And then, let's make some goddamn amends.
Maybe you should start with the family whose playhouse you just smashed.
[crying.]
Oh, no! Oh.
Hey, kid! I'm sorry your lame dad built such a cheap-ass playhouse! Yeah, you gotta use parallel joints to support that foundation, dumbshit! Also, suck a dick! You know what? I do feel better.
[laughing.]
[crying.]
[doorbell ringing.]
I don't think they're home.
So, we wait.
I need to make amends to Diane, and we're not leaving until I do.
[sighs.]
But it's boring out here, and I'm hungry and I'm bored! I bet they have food inside.
Let's see if I still have that spare key.
Here it is.
[grunts.]
Yes! Okay, after we get food, remind me that this is another thing I need to make amends for.
[sighs, burps.]
Where are those two? They did not keep their fridge stocked enough for two stoned people waiting around for hours.
It's only been, like, ten minutes.
You have a real thing with food.
That's what happens when you mix the appetite of a horse with the appetite of someone with a hole inside him that needs to be constantly filled with attention, food, and sex.
Pass the Bugles.
There's no more Bugles.
There's no more of anything.
Let's just go.
I can't leave until I make amends.
[gasps.]
I got a idea! My name is BoJack's friend What's-Her-Face and I wear glasses.
Do you have something to say to me, BoJack? Am I BoJack or Mr.
Peanutbutter? You can be anyone you want.
This is your dream dream dream Stop doing that.
We're both awake.
Let's just get to this.
Diane, I'm sorry I said mean things to you.
That's cool.
I forgive you.
Wait, would my character say that? What's Diane's deal again? She's, like, an Asian Daria? She's a little more complex.
But she's basically Asian Daria, right? With the glasses and the jacket and her whole "blah" thing.
Okay, shut up.
Now, I'll be Mr.
Peanutbutter and you make amends to me.
Who's Mr.
Peanutbutter? And, now, you be Mr.
Carolyn and I'll be Princess Diana.
Oh, yeah.
Good idea.
[both grunting.]
Um should we do something about this? Hey, why don't you two sleep this off in our guest room? Oh, my God, that mirror is talking to us! You can't stop us, us from the future! We're making amends, assholes! [screaming.]
[both groan.]
Ow! Come on! That felt so good! See? When you make amends, don't you just feel lighter? Well, I also ate a shit ton of Bugles, so no.
But I do feel like we got to the bottom of who really killed Princess Di.
It was all of us.
Next stop, Todd! Todd, I'm sorry.
I want to take full responsibility for what happened, even though it is not my fault and I did nothing wrong.
Emily is an adult woman who can make her own choices.
And besides, are you even really into girls? I mean, what is your deal? Uh Hey, what are you doing with our son? Uh Wait, you're BoJack Horseman.
I am, and this is my best buddy Todd.
[grunts.]
That movie star has really taken a shine to our boy.
You think this is our big break? You don't think he's inappropriately interested, do you? What? No.
But if he is, that could also be a big break.
I'm just saying.
[groans.]
[stammering.]
Hey, wait! Hold on.
Where are you going? Come back.
You want to take Todd for a sleepover? Sleepover? No offense, Todd, but your parents are creeping me out.
To the next amends! [screaming.]
[grunting.]
What do you want, BoJack? I don't know.
I'm very drunk and a little nauseous, but if I'm here in your house, it must be to make amends.
Amends for what? I don't know.
Whatever it is that you think I did to make you disappear.
BoJack How could you leave me like that when I needed you most? I'm sorry, BoJack.
I thought you were a winner.
I was wrong.
This is hard for me, too.
I staked my reputation No, this is not about the Oscar campaign.
How could you think that this is about the Oscar campaign? We had something more, didn't we? You've been drinking.
Well, not just drinking.
[snorting.]
Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.
Whoa! I am a broken, screwed-up misfit toy, and you act all in control, but I know that, deep down, you're broken, too.
And I don't know why you won't just give us a chance to be broken together.
What about that doesn't appeal to you? [sighs.]
BoJack, when I was in college, I had a job as a lifeguard Wait, did we just go to Ana's house? Did I get closure? If by "closure" you mean I lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.
We gotta go back.
What the hell? I know I was just here, but I feel like you told me some important story that explained everything about us.
Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.
Gotta be honest.
I've had a couple beers.
Ugh! All right, I'll tell you again, if it'll make you leave.
When I was a lifeguard, I Oh, crud.
You want to go back to Ana's, don't you? I feel like I'll definitely get it this time.
Lifeguard One more time? No.
This time I wrote it down.
"I'm a lifeguard.
This woman's house smells weird, or is that me? Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.
Don't do that thing where you write down your thoughts instead of what the person is actually saying.
I wonder if it's time to get my boobs done again.
" Mm-hmm.
[inhales.]
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
Who's next? I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [sighs.]
[door sliding closed.]
Okay, so I know I keep bothering you tonight.
Tonight? I haven't seen you in two weeks.
Oh, really? I just need to know what you were trying to tell me about being a lifeguard, and then, I'll leave and you'll never see me again.
Mmm After I almost drowned, I decided I would never again be weaker than water.
So, I became a lifeguard.
On my first day of training, my instructor told me that there are going to be times when you'll see someone in trouble.
You're going to want to rush in there and do whatever you can to save them, but you have to stop yourself, because there are some people you can't save.
'Cause those people will thrash and struggle and try to take you down with them.
What does that have to do with me? What the? Where the hell are we now? Ohi Ojai? We drove all the way to Ojai? Let me finish.
Ohi, and here's the kicker O.
Ohio.
We drove all the way to Ohio?! I wanted to go to the planetarium, but you demanded we come here.
You said you had to make one more amend, to that Penny girl.
What? No! That is a terrible idea.
Let's turn this car around right now.
[tires squealing.]
Uh I feel we didn't turn the car around.
No, we did, but then, you turned it back around because you really wanted to find that deer girl, so we decided to do a stakeout.
There was a whole makeover sequence, where we went to the mall and tried on different trench coats for each other.
Do you not remember any of that? This is insane.
I already scarred her for life.
If I see her again, I'll just end up getting my horribleness all over her.
You think it's too late for me to go to college? I always wanted to be an architect.
But one of those architects, where, at night, she's a high-end call girl, and, by day, she's an international superspy.
So, when is she an architect? I don't know.
Frontier times? No, I didn't mean what era.
If she's a call girl at night and a spy during the day Hey, look, Penny.
Oh, God, what's she doing? Does she look emotionally damaged? She's just going to the computer.
She's probably in a sex chat room with some middle-aged horse because that's the only way she can still feel love.
Yeah, probably.
Or she's so upset about what you did that she's using the Internet to find ways to commit suicide.
That makes even more sense.
All right, we've established that you ruined her.
Can we go back to L.
A.
now? Yes.
So obviously, I wanted to keep following Penny because I'm an idiot.
Let's just nip this in the bud.
I'm gonna write "Do not follow Penny" on my hands in the unlikely scenario of my blacking out again.
I'll just write "Follow Penny" on this hand, and then, on this hand, I'll write Goddamn it! What? We're just doing what the hand said.
[groans.]
Uh, what? The hand demanded donuts.
[gasps.]
There she is.
She's drinking beer.
Oh, God, this is just like the episode of Horsin' Around when Olivia went to the frat party, but Penny doesn't have a kind angel played by Jose Canseco to help her get out of this jam! Ugh.
Okay, now, I'm bored again.
Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.
She's just drinking Red Bull.
Wait.
Now, she's leaving.
[both gasp.]
Hey, look, it's the Obertones! Love your sound, dudes! Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you! She seems fine.
Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secret that's eating away at her soul.
Or, possibly she's fine.
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.
Hey, you were a father figure, who was sexually inappropriate to me, and I turned out perfect.
Now, can we please go home? Okay, good plan.
I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.
Whoa.
Look at me, walking good.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[all screaming melodically.]
No, no, no! Shush, shush.
BoJack? Oh! What are you doing here? Hey, Penny! Did you come here to find me? No, I You can't be here.
I-I don't want to see you here.
I don't want to see you at all.
I was 17.
I didn't know any better.
I tried You need to leave.
It's BoJack Horseman and Sarah Lynn! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! BoJack, we need to get out of here now.
Can I get a selfie and another selfie if the first selfie doesn't look good? [overlapping chatter.]
BoJack, over here! Penny, no.
Penny? You know, on the plus side, she really seemed okay.
Mm-hmm.
Until she saw you and freaked out.
[groans.]
But she probably would have been totally fine if you'd never shown up.
Oh, God.
I think the wound was completely healed before you reopened it by showing up unannounced at her college and all the pain came rushing back to her.
Oh, good Lord! In a way, it's like you destroyed her life twice.
Will you please stop talking about it? Okay, fine.
Whoop.
[shivers.]
Man, Ohio sucks! Next time, could you almost molest someone who lives in Hawaii? You could be bummed out at a luau right now.
Let's just go home.
You got a bottle opener? Glove compartment.
Well, I'll be a dick sucked by a dumbshit! What do we have here? Oh, that? Turns out there's a brand of heroin called BoJack.
Dude, that's a big freaking deal.
Getting a drug named after you is cooler than getting an Oscar.
I mean, there's Billy Crystal Meth, Angel Dustin Hoffman, Lucille Eightball and now you.
It's a rarefied breed, man.
Congratulations! Thank you? Oh, we have to do BoJack! It's too perfect.
I don't know.
There's that old saying.
"Liquor before beer, never fear.
Don't do heroin.
" "I'm BoJack.
Please, put me inside you.
" I'm not gonna shoot heroin with you, Sarah Lynn.
We can snort heroin like sophisticated adults.
Way ahead of you.
[both snorting, sighing.]
[moaning.]
Okay, thank you.
Happy Thanksgiving 2007.
Why did you just say what year it is? I guess I just get nervous talking to network executives.
This last episode got the worst ratings yet.
I was afraid your character trying heroin would be a bridge too far.
Oh.
And the disjointed blackout structure, with the one flashback in the middle, really confused our audience.
Yeah.
They hated all the fourth-wall-breaking meta jokes.
Of course.
Audiences hate meta jokes.
When will comedy writers learn? BoJack, I know there is an audience out there for our show.
We just need to find a way to get more people to check us out.
I know what you're thinking Full frontal.
I was thinking guest star.
We need a celebrity who is incredibly popular right now, like Oh, what about Sarah Lynn? Ooh, that's genius! Sarah Lynn? I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her in years.
Besides, she's not gonna want to do this.
She's the world's biggest pop star.
She's the only hope we have to keep this show alive.
Would you ask her? I'm sure she'd do it for you.
You're like a father to her.
[screams, groans.]
[moaning.]
So, what is it? What is what? You were mumbling about how you had to ask me something.
Oh! Um, never mind.
Hey, how long have we known each other? Feels like our entire lives.
Well, my entire life, pretty much.
We were on a TV show.
Isn't that insane? Yeah, it's pretty wild.
You know, sometimes it feels like you're the only one who really understands me, because how could anyone else? Nobody knows what we went through, nobody who wasn't on that show.
But we knew each other before we were anybody, and that's how we can be friends, because we're not like those other people.
The people who glom onto you because of who they think you are, and they think they can sleep on your couch and eat your food.
They think you're gonna save their agency.
I never asked for that kind of pressure, but you and me, we don't want anything from each other.
You know, I I could never figure out what love meant, but, right now, I don't need to figure out anything.
I just feel it.
I love you, Sarah Lynn.
[siren blaring in distance.]
Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn? What? Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay! I'm not okay.
I'm bored.
This hotel room is boring! [sighs.]
What's on TV? [gasps.]
The Oscars are on.
Really? How long have we been on this bender? I love the Oscars.
The red carpet, the fashion, all the magic of Hollywoo wrapped up in one exciting night.
And the winner for Best Original Song is "The Silly Banana Song (Love Theme)" from The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee by Sarah Lynn.
Get your ass up here, girl.
[screams.]
I won! Oh, my God! I forgot I was even nominated.
I accept this on her behalf.
And if you're watching this, Sarah Lynn, wherever you are, please come home.
[exhales sharply.]
Oh, man, I should have been there.
When I was a kid, if you'd told me I'd win an Oscar, I'd never have believed it.
And, now, I've done it and BoJack I don't like anything about me.
Hey.
None of this is me.
These boobs aren't me.
This house isn't me.
We're not at your house right now.
The only reason I wear this shirt is because some company paid me $8,000 to wear it.
And I don't even need the money.
[scoffs.]
I just liked that someone still wanted me to wear their shirt.
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
What am I supposed to do? I don't know what to do.
Am I doomed? Are you doomed? Are we all doomed? No, no! Calm down.
Nobody is doomed.
And I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna go to the planetarium.
Really? [man.]
Our solar system formed about four and a half billion years ago Isn't this place amazing? Totally.
I always forget that there are more than just the six stars you can see in the Los Angeles sky.
Yeah, that's cool, too, but I meant this building.
It's a giant dome.
Domes are so cool.
I prefer rectangular buildings, as I firmly established.
[yawns.]
I wanna be an architect.
[man.]
be it horse, cat, human, or even lizard, our lives are but the briefest flashes in a universe that is billions of years old.
See, Sarah Lynn, we're not doomed.
In the great grand scheme of things, we're just tiny specks that will one day be forgotten.
So, it doesn't matter what we did in the past, or how we'll be remembered.
The only thing that matters is right now, this moment, this one spectacular moment we are sharing together.
Right, Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn? 
[people chanting.]
Sarah Lynn! Sarah Lynn! [Sarah Lynn.]
Okay, one more song.
I'm gonna slow things down.
This is "My Heinie Ain't So Tiny.
" [slow ballad playing.]
[music stops abruptly.]
Sarah Lynn is very tired.
Can you just tell her BoJack's here? Horseman.
I'm an old friend.
Well, I'll tell her, but [groaning.]
[Sarah Lynn.]
BoJack? Oh, my God! Bring him in! I can't believe you came to my concert.
It was incredible.
When you sang that one ballad and shot fireworks out of your boobs, that was such a moving tribute to gays in the military.
We are going out.
Before you go, I need you to sign these posters.
It's for charity.
Doctors Without Posters.
Okay.
BoJack, can you hang out for a minute? Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
Also, we have those radio records, and you're doing the print ads for Sarah Lynn's Stank, the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.
You mean Calvin Klein.
Kevin Kline, BoJack.
He's the only man who truly understands my fragrance.
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.
Oh, my God.
Being famous is the worst.
Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
No, but, like, really famous.
Uh How can I explain it to someone like you? I feel like all my friends only like me because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.
Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
Who's Sarah Lipschitz? The lawyer who helped me change my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.
Oof! It is so great to see a real friend who knew me before I got huge and isn't just trying to get something out of me.
Right.
I swear you are, like, the only one I have left.
I am this close to falling off the deep end.
[laughs.]
I know I'm smiling right now, but the light inside me is dying.
Uh, what? But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.
What is going on with you? Well, actually, I'm doing this new show, The BoJack Horseman Show.
I don't know if you've seen it or Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.
Yeah, no, of course, no, but it's been a lot of fun.
The ratings aren't great, but we have this upcoming episode, and we're looking for a really big guest star.
Oh.
You want me to be on your show? Well, I just thought it would be really fun for the both of us.
You know, like the old days.
I have the script with me if you want to take a look at it.
Um, okay.
Why don't you put it on that pile over there? And I'll get to it when I have some free time.
Over here? Yeah.
I'd love to keep hanging out, but these doctors need their posters, and I'm already pretty exhausted.
You should probably go.
Oh, okay.
It's all very exhausting.
Thanks again for coming.
Like I said, it's always nice to see a you.
Yeah.
[male voice.]
Adam Levine has tweeted his sympathies.
"Today we lost an icon.
#SheWillBeLoved #WatchTheVoiceSeason10.
" Again, for those just joining us, actress and pop star Sarah Lynn is dead at 31.
Day 75 at sea, there's a darkness brewing on the horizon.
I feel it.
What say you, skippy? [Todd's voice.]
I think you got a touch of the ocean madness, Margo.
And I think you got a real smart mouth.
You want another night in the box? No, anything but that! Then quit your yappin' and fix Mama a Sazerac.
Hey, is that character actress Margo Martindale? She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list and the AV Club's list of 20 actresses that always make everything better.
We gotta call this in, right? That depends.
Are we professional blimp pilots, or are we casting directors? Blimp pilots, sir.
Then we're not being paid to discover underutilized character actresses.
We're being paid to pilot this blimp.
Hey, Margo, do you see something out there across the water? Yeah.
What is that? [choking.]
[horn blaring.]
[British accent.]
All clear from here to Los Angeles.
[British accent.]
We've hit a few delays, but you'll get your precious cargo by tomorrow.
[Italian accent.]
Tomorrow? But the big opening of my restaurant is tonight! How can I offer the real Italian cuisine without my real Italian spaghett'? Spaghett' is how Italian people say "spaghetti.
" We'll get you your pasta.
Better do what he says.
He might have friends in the Mob.
"Friends in the Mob"? That is an ugly stereotype.
[speaking Italian.]
You heard the man.
Set this boat's controls to "faster.
" Aye-aye, Cap'n.
Oh, I see how it is.
Wanna play a game of chicken, huh? I don't think this is a good idea, Margo.
Cram it, skip! Those limp dicks are about to find out what savvy film and television viewers have known for years.
Character actress Margo Martindale ain't afraid of nothin'! The boats are about to collide! We have to do something! You know damn well, when we took to the sky, we made a solemn oath never to meddle in the affairs of land nor sea.
We are sworn but to observe.
This is the blimper's promise.
Oh, no! The boats are tearing each other apart! Crates and crates of spaghetti are pouring out into the ocean! I'm watching the same boat collision you are.
You don't need to narrate it.
[screaming.]
Oh! No! Skippy! He was too pure for this world! Oh, no! The pasta is cooking! If only we had some olive oil to reduce the stickiness.
But olive oil doesn't actually reduce the stickiness in pasta.
That's only a myth.
No! I've wasted so much of my life stirring olive oil into pasta! Disaster al dente off the coast of San Clemente! Twelve tons of pasta have leaked into the ocean, and the massive carbo load is heading straight to Pacific Ocean City.
[screaming.]
Joining us via Google Hangout is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.
What can you tell us, Carla? Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks, it will expand, smothering the town and tenderly broiling the sea life who reside there.
Is there any way to prevent this delicious-sounding environmental catastrophe? The only hope for rescue would be if someone had an enormous quantity of spaghetti strainers just sitting around the house, but that person would also need access to a fleet of drivers to transport said spaghetti strainers, and in order to strain the spaghetti fast enough, the drivers would also need to be incredibly strong swimmers, like, just as an example, hot, sexy killer whales.
Is there such a savior who could possibly fit that ridiculously specific set of criteria? I don't know, Tom, but as they used to say on my favorite TV show, let's find out.
A movie, during the day? Dare I? One for Secretariat, please! [barks.]
Thank you.
And, now, to turn my phone off.
If anyone needs me in the next two hours, they'll just have to wait.
[Tom on TV.]
This tragedy truly puts the "no" into noodle, the "ruh-roh" in rotelli, and the "oh, man" in manicotti.
Damn it, Randy.
Just pick your best one.
What's going on? You didn't hear? They need spaghetti strainers stat, or it's "pasta la vista" for Pacific Ocean City.
Oh, no! [crowd screaming.]
[dramatic music playing.]
Come on, come on, come on! Pick up, Mr.
Peanutbutter! Hello? Oh! Mr.
Peanutbutter, we need You've reached the voicemail of Mr.
Peanutbutter.
No! [BoJack.]
I'm not just running for me.
I'm running for America.
Oh-ho-ho! Cabracadabblers, to Mr.
Peanutbutter's house! Mr.
Peanutbutter's House the show, or Mr.
Peanutbutter's house the house? The house.
Obviously, the house.
[dramatic music playing.]
Wow, that was a good movie.
Was it Oscar-worthy? Who's to say? Ninety-eight messages? Better listen to them all, in order.
[Todd.]
Mr.
Peanutbutter, call me back as soon as you get this, okay? We need your strainers.
This is life and death.
Oh, my God! [Todd.]
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I'm at your house with the entire Cabracadabra fleet, but we can't get in! You need to get over here! It's a spaghetti-strainerrelated emergency.
All right, buddy, just as soon as I listen to these other 96 messages.
[man.]
Good afternoon, I'm calling from Center Theater Group.
You saw a play once eight years ago.
I wonder if I could interest you in a full season subscription Oh, I don't have time for this! [grunts.]
[rock music playing.]
If we don't get some kind of miracle Wait! In the distance! Is that? No, it can't be! Spaghetti or not, here I come.
[studio audience laughing.]
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Sabrina, I'm coming down for my birthday surprise! Oh, no! Well, I've heard of pasta point of no return, but this is ridiculous! [studio audience laughing.]
[groans.]
Why didn't you just tell me you made too much spaghetti? I thought if you knew I made a big mess that you wouldn't love me anymore.
[audience.]
Aw! Sabrina, that's not going to happen.
We're a family now, no matter what, and I will always be there for you.
Okay.
[grunts.]
Now, get in that kitchen and eat all that spaghetti.
I gotta eat all that? That's too much, man! [studio audience applauds.]
I never understood why the Horsin' Around house had two sets of stairs.
What? One in the living room and one in the kitchen.
Why? Have you ever been in a house like that? What are you doing here? You didn't answer your phone.
I was worried about you.
[takes deep breath.]
The funeral was huge.
There were so many people there.
I kept thinking, "I did this to her," and everyone was just standing around like, "Well, this was bound to happen," but it wasn't bound to happen.
I'm really sorry, BoJack.
I don't know how to be, Diane.
It doesn't get better and it doesn't get easier.
I can't keep lying to myself, saying "I'm gonna change.
" I'm poison.
BoJack I come from poison.
I have poison inside me, and I destroy everything I touch.
That's my legacy.
I have nothing to show for the life that I've lived, and I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me.
That isn't true.
Isn't it, though? [sighs.]
When I was a kid, I used to watch you on TV.
And you know I didn't have the best family.
Things weren't that great for me.
But, for half an hour every week, I got to watch this show about four people who had nobody, who came together and became a family.
And, for half an hour every week, I had a home, and it helped me survive.
BoJack, there are millions of people who are better off for having known you.
Why did you never tell me that? I guess to preserve some fiction of journalistic objectivity.
Like that's a thing.
I know you don't want to hear this, but you're too good to be writing Instagram captions for celebrities.
I'm not just I'm sorry, but you are.
You know you are.
Okay.
Thank you.
And I wish you didn't get so distant after you moved out.
I'm sorry.
You know me better than anybody, and you can't not be a part of my life.
Tools! This is Brad.
I want to do Ethan Around.
Oh, very funny.
Is this Jeff from Hammers and More? No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.
Wait, really? Yeah.
I think now more than ever people need shows like Horsin' Around.
I need a show like Horsin' Around.
Okay, but this isn't like last time, is it? Where you say you want to do it, but then, I find out you don't actually want to do it, and then, your mean publicist yells at me? And, at the airport, on the way home, I get one of those big pretzels, but then, I drop the pretzel on the ground, and it gets eaten by a ant? What? No.
You won't regret this, BoJack.
Attention, customers! Please leave and never come back.
Tools! is closed forever.
I'm going Hollywoo! [gasps.]
Please, please! I'm no hero.
I'm just a guy with some bowls full of holes.
Thanks again.
It's funny.
You help out at one disaster area, and, suddenly, everybody loves you, unless you're Sean Penn.
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press, and you can buy most kinds of press.
I hope some of that press makes its way to this reader because she is not a fan of Cabracadabra.
She hates it.
I don't hate Cabracadabra.
I just think it objectifies women and contributes to a cheap and damaging culture of sexist commodification that undercuts the exact reason it was started in the first place.
But, you know, everything does that.
Cosmo does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear statues.
Yes, but this objectification of women ended up saving lots of lives, many of whom were also women, so, therefore, not sexist? I can't argue with that.
Well, the good news is, you don't have to anymore, because I'm selling the company! [both.]
Oh! You know, it's really too bad you shut down the agency, because, if you could've held out for just a couple more months, right now, Vim would be rolling in money.
I'm really happy for you, but I'm actually enjoying my time off.
Ralph and I went on vacation.
Can you believe this one had never been to Cairo? Those Egyptians really know how to treat a cat.
And what do you do, Ralph, that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo? Well, I own and operate my own greeting card company, but everywhere I go, I have a free room.
Oh, because you're a mouse? What? No.
Because I'm a Stilton.
Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels? [ringtone playing.]
I gotta take this.
It's my new agent.
Hello? So, anyway [Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Another offer? That's incredible! Ralph and I They want to pay me how much? That is a lot of zeroes.
Sign me up.
[laughing.]
What is he doing? You never take the first offer.
[clears throat.]
Hey, Diane, what have you been up to? Well, I'm just weighing my options.
I don't want to just jump into my next You know what you should do? Ralph's sister Stefani is starting a new website.
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/ newsletter/community hub, and she's looking for a partner/editor/ "bomb-ass super bitch," her words.
You'd be perfect for it.
I'll set a meeting.
Yeah, that could be cool.
Why don't you give her my info? No, no.
I'll just set a meeting.
It's easy.
I'm not doing anything else.
Except enjoying your time off, right? Right.
Wow, another amazing offer! It's like everywhere I look, money, money, money! Even ten percent of this would be quite a windfall.
[groans.]
I like your friends.
Yeah.
And I like this.
[both.]
Mwah! This is working.
I like it, too.
That was smart of you to think of Diane for GirlCrush.
You're always making great connections.
That's probably why you were such a good manager.
I wasn't a manager.
I was an agent.
Oh, right.
Sorry.
Well, whatever it was, I'm glad that it's over, because I don't want to share you with anybody.
Oh, my God! Maybe that was the problem! Maybe what was the problem? All this time, I thought I was an agent, but what if what I was really supposed to be was a manager? What's the difference? It's a completely different line of work.
An agent helps a client find jobs, but a manager helps manage a client's career.
It sounds exactly the same.
I think I'm having an epiphany.
It's like I've been wearing the wrong bra size this whole time.
Okay, if this is the thing that'll make you happy, then I totally support you, but it kind of sounds like you're just going back to the same sort of job that made you miserable for the last 20 years.
No, Ralph.
Don't you get it? This is a new beginning.
I'm gonna be a manager! Oh Wow.
Takes you back, doesn't it? Listen, before everyone gets here tomorrow, I have a couple notes on the script.
Too many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas," or not enough? No.
On page 18, Ethan and the Horse try to get Julia to put on the roller skates, and she runs out of the room crying, and then, the Horse says, "That went well.
" Anything about that feel weird to you? No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.
It didn't go well.
So, when the Horse says, "That went well," it's funny.
Dramatic irony.
No, I get the irony.
That's not the issue.
This is a guaranteed laugh.
You're giving me the cut to commercial.
And that's a problem for you? This is Ethan Around.
It's your show, and we need to tell the audience that.
You can't give all the best jokes to me.
I don't know, BoJack.
You really think I'm ready for a "That went well"? You tell me.
Let's hear it.
That went well! You're pushing too hard.
The line's funny.
Trust the line.
That went well.
Great.
Now let me hear you throw it away.
Oh, like a That went well.
Yes, that was great! And that was a great look, with the eyebrow.
What if we both did that? Yeah, yeah.
I'm looking at you like, "This parenting thing is gonna be harder than I thought," and you're looking at me like, "Now you see what I had to go through.
" Exactly.
Let's try it.
Well, that went well.
[both.]
Hmm Oh, my God.
Chills.
Yeah, you feel that? Yeah.
Now that's how you cut to commercial.
That actually went well.
[sitcom music playing.]
This place has really gone downhill since they got that new chef.
As I was saying, I don't think the site needs to be just one thing.
I think it can be a big umbrella, but, like, also not an umbrella.
That's GirlCroosh.
Sorry, did you say "croosh"? Oh, you do not need to apologize here, Diane.
"Sorry" is a crutch and "crutch" is an ableist term.
I'm sorry if that shocks you, but I will not apologize for it.
So, can I ask what the business model is here? Diane, I'm rich.
I'm not doing this to make money.
I'm doing this to make connections with real women and extend my personal brand as a real down-to-earth chica who cares about real women.
Well, you know what's great about that is, if you're not beholden to ad revenue, your writers can Yes! That is exactly the idea, whatever you were about to say.
I want to give you a real support system, because, honestly, Diane, what you do is so croosh.
That shit you said about Hank Hippopopalous last year was supernova red hot badass.
It wasn't even on fleek.
Fleek was on it.
Thank you.
One thing though.
Is anything off limits? Like, if you had to write a piece about your husband, could you do it? Why would I have to do that? I don't know.
Because his company is basically Hooters on wheels? He's actually selling that company.
Well, he's still a public figure.
What if Mr.
Peanutbutter does something problematic and you have a real hot take? If I have a problem with my husband, I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.
Okay, so what if you did that and he didn't listen, and you knew that, as much as you love him and as much as he loves you, he's never gonna get it? And meanwhile, you also knew that all your readers looked up to you and wanted to read your opinion? Would you write about it then? You got the job? I got the job! Oh, my God! Can you believe it? In the same week, I sell a company for millions of dollars and you get a job writing for a blog.
When it rains, it pours, huh? And over here is where you can keep all of your receipts, in your leaning tower of receipts.
I think my client can handle it from here.
This meeting is just to give you and the other former partners your money.
Sign here.
Okay.
And here's your check.
That's all this needed to be.
Whoa! This is for eight million dollars.
Well, you are a one-third owner.
What did you expect? Todd, as a millionaire? That'll lead to some interesting stories.
What an exciting development.
How's that gonna change the dynamic? I guess we're gonna find out, right? You can leave now.
Hooray! Todd's in the one percent.
Oh, uh Hey.
Hi.
[studio audience laughing.]
Julia, this ice cream is only for girls who try on their roller skates.
So, what do you say? Uh, I'm gonna swipe left on that idea.
[audience laughing.]
Cut! We got a lighting issue.
What? I'll be in my trailer.
[audience laughing.]
Hey, Chloe, that was really funny.
Thanks.
Are you having fun? Mm-hmm.
You got any friends in the audience? No friends, but my mommy and my daddy.
Oh.
You want to know a secret about your mommy and daddy? What? They are really proud of you.
Oh, I know that.
What do you want to be when you grow up, Chloe? What do you mean? I want to be like you.
Like me? I want to be famous.
Oh, no.
BoJack? [stammering.]
Oh, God.
Is everything okay? I can't be here.
I can't do this again.
This isn't right.
What do you mean? I need to go.
We need to shoot the rest of this episode.
I'm sorry.
I just I don't belong here.
Where are you going? I don't know.
["Stars" playing.]
So, what are you gonna do with your eight million dollars? First, I'm gonna get a really fancy hat, like, really fancy.
Then, I'm gonna get a T-shirt that says, "Hey, look at my hat.
" [both laugh.]
What about you? I've always wanted to go to a super nice restaurant and order everything on the menu.
Oh, yeah! That's, like, first day millionaire stuff.
We should go sometime, together.
Todd, can I ask you something? Of course.
What's your deal? I feel like you like me, but you don't like me, but you like me, and I don't know what that is.
Are you gay? Whoa.
Why would you even? You can tell me if you're gay.
It's fine.
This isn't the 1600s, or some places in the present.
I'm not gay.
I mean, I don't think I am, but I don't think I'm straight, either.
I don't know what I am.
I think I might be nothing.
Oh.
Well, that's okay.
Yeah? Yeah, of course.
[Southern accent.]
Thank you so much.
Oh, crap! I accidentally tipped the waitress eight million dollars! Well, guess I'm broke again.
[both laughing.]
[doorbell rings.]
Who could that be? Pizza? Katrina, you're not pizza.
Ugh.
This fight again? Listen, butt-sniffer, I work for a guy and we're looking for a guy.
You're supposed to be this big hero now, so someone brought your name up in a meeting, and, now, I have an opportunity for you.
Oh, is it being married to you again? Because I'd rather get euthanized.
Spoiler alert from Marley & Me.
That wasn't a spoiler until you said the name of the movie.
If you've got a gig for me, you can go through my new manager.
Oh, I'm not talking about a gig.
Then what are you talking about? Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina! How would you like to be the governor? Whoa.
Of California? Yes, of California.
[Diane.]
Who's at the door? Is it pizza? [phone ringing, faintly.]
[sighs.]
Welcome back.
Your first meeting's at 10:00, and you have a lunch at 11:30.
Thank you, Judah.
Also, I have someone on line two trying to get in touch with BoJack Horseman.
I have no idea how she got this number.
It sounds like it's a teenage girl.
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.
We can't help you.
[MAN.]
So you said let's do the show about the horse, but this time without the horse.
[WOMAN.]
I know, I'm sorry.
[MAN.]
And I said, "That's a terrible idea.
" And you said, "I got someone even better.
" I got What's this asshole's name again? Vincent D'Onofrio.
And here we are.
[DIRECTOR.]
Okay.
Action! Hey, Zoe.
Hey, Zelda.
I forgot my boombox.
And your deodorant.
Pee-yew, mister.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS.]
Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.
Adopted, by me? Children, I'm a single breakdancing instructor who can barely take care of himself.
Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.
[RHYTHMIC GRUNTING.]
Ooh! And shake it up.
Hah! [MAN COUGHS.]
Cut! [KLAXON BLARES.]
It's fine, Katrina.
If I didn't randomly wander into doors all the time, I never would have ended up co-piloting the very plane that brought me to Los Angeles.
Excuse me, didn't you see the flashing red light outside the door? Of course.
That's why I stopped what I was doing to come inside.
[LAUGHING.]
Ooh, are you filming a sitcom? I love sitcoms! You should have a character say, "Talk to the hand.
" [LAUGHTER.]
The hand! Not the face, where the ears are.
Newsflash: hands can't hear.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE.]
What do you mean the character needs to be more likable? They don't teach likability at the American Stanislavski Theatre.
Look, this is not about your acting.
You don't want an actor, you want a blank canvas upon which to project your own mawkish notions of goodness.
Some man for all seasons up for a bit of anything cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.
I assure you no such man exists.
But you're welcome to keep looking.
This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.
Hah hah! Hmm.
But my favorite scenes are when a character is completely oblivious to something really important going on behind him.
That, dear friends, is where the sit truly hits the com.
Excuse me.
Kind of in the middle of something.
He's yakking away, tension's building Hey, you, sir.
the audience is like, "Hey, turn around.
" Maybe the person behind him even interrupts him Can we talk to you for a second? Just like that.
And then, when it would be ridiculous to go on even one second longer My name is David Chase.
Do you mind? Only then does he say, exasperated, "What? What do you want?" I want your face on billboards, you beautiful nonsensical clown prince.
Doggie-doggie what now? [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE.]
Kid, how'd you like to be the star of "Untitled Horsin' Around Knockoff"? Me, a star? But I have no experience, no formal training.
Hey, you, you don't need any of those things.
You got "it.
" Ohh [THEME MUSIC PLAYING.]
[DIANE.]
Hey, BoJack, it's me again.
[YAWNS.]
Hmm? [GROANS.]
I haven't heard from you in, like, three months, so I'm calling again to make sure you're okay.
[OVERLAPPING CHATTER.]
What's new with me? Well Monocle? No, I think you're thinking of Mr.
Peanut.
[DIANE.]
I don't know if you heard but Mr.
Peanutbutter is running for governor, kind of.
I want a comprehensive crisscross of cold calls to Contra Costa County.
I mean, Christ, people, get me signatures.
First, they need to get Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz recalled, which is basically impossible.
So that actually makes it really easy for me to be supportive.
[SMOOCHING.]
[CHUCKLES.]
How's the recall effort? Stupendous! Uh, no.
We're about 4,000 signatures shy of stupendous, and the deadline's in a week.
Even if you don't get all the signatures, I'll still be proud of you.
Maybe even more so.
But when we do get the signatures we need please note I said "when," not "if" Noted.
then the campaign will begin in oh, where did you say again, Katrina? Earnest.
When we get the signatures, the campaign will begin in earnest.
Right.
Earnest, California.
Earnest is not a city in Cal Why do I try? Looks like you two have everything worked out.
Just please note that I am being supportive.
Noted! [DIANE.]
Most women wouldn't like having their husband's ex-wife hanging around all the time, but I'm totally cool with it because she makes me look super chill by comparison.
Oh, uh okay.
Anyway, call me back.
This is Diane, by the way.
Nguyen, obviously.
You sure you wouldn't rather just play a governor in a movie or TV show? I could attach Tommy Schlamme to direct.
Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.
This is bigger than all that.
Don't you recall? Recall what? The governor.
We need signatures.
Oh, sure.
Where do you stand on the issues? Oh, he doesn't stand anywhere on issues because he's not running for governor yet.
I'm mainly for people right now and also for the future.
[GROANS.]
Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.
Why don't you go get signatures downstairs.
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.
She'll sign on to anything.
Judah! Can I get your John Wilkes Hancock? Oh, I never developed a signature.
I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.
But I can print my name legibly.
Thank you, Rain Man-bun.
That'll do nicely.
Okay.
[GROANING.]
Ralph dropped this off for you.
"I always make a beeline to see my feline.
" Aww! Also, you wanted me to remind you about FX's American Dead Girl miniseries.
Oh, that's right! What train wreck are we rubbernecking at this year? They're doing the Sarah Lynn story and they're looking for someone to play BoJack.
Oh! [RETCHING, COUGHING.]
Well, as I was saying, FX is looking for a BoJack Horseman [RETCHING, CLEARING THROAT.]
Ugh! Horseman Ho [RETCHING.]
[MOANING.]
So, as we discussed earlier, is this one of the moments where you would want privacy? You know what I'd do if I had eight million dollars? Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.
Oh, no, no, no.
I mean, if I had eight million dollars now, I'd start a company that makes remote-controlled drones.
But these drones have a seat hanging from the bottom so you can fly around in it.
A drone with a throne.
A drone throne.
But if you're in it, isn't it not a drone? I feel like you're getting really hung up on labels.
Well, anyways, with my eight million dollars I'm starting a new dating app just for firemen and redheaded women named Emily.
Aww, you don't need an app, just hang out with me.
Todd, you're great.
What a way to end a sentence.
But I want a boyfriend who isn't asexual.
Whoa.
Why did you call me that? No, no, it's not bad.
I didn't mean it negatively.
I was just, like, stating it.
I'm not that word doesn't describe Okay, okay, I'm sorry, whatever you call yourself, you're my friend and I support you.
But sometimes labels can be helpful.
Wow.
Well, I would label this conversation "rough".
Here's the check.
And this cow likes getting tipped.
[DIANE.]
Hey, BoJack, it's me again, voicemail number 17.
Did I tell you I'm working at a blog? I wrote a story about an all-girl refugee kickball league.
It didn't get as many clicks as Gillian's story about how in certain pictures you can see the outline of Chris Hemsworth's penis but, you know, we're all contributing in our own ways.
Anyway, it's weird not having you around.
I hope you're okay, wherever you are.
"I'm so smitten with my favorite little adult cat.
" Oh! I love it.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the Paul Blart 3: Till Death Do Us Blart premiere last night.
I had a doctor's appointment.
Whoa.
Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
I don't like not knowing where you are, especially when we live three freeways and an unprotected left turn away from each other.
I was thinking, what if you move somewhere closer to me, like into my house? Oh.
[STAMMERS.]
Wow! Would you, could you, with a mouse? I I could, and I would, but it's not a good time.
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.
No, no, it's fine.
There's no hurry.
We're still young, right? Oh, yeah, I'm super young.
Blake Lively accidentally called me Mommy yesterday, but I'm sure she does that to other young women all the time.
[MOANING, SLURPING.]
[DOORBELL RINGS.]
[GASPS.]
Churro-flavored waffles! [DOORBELL RINGING.]
Huh? [GASPS.]
Drone Throne.
Whoa, whoa! Okay, Todd.
Whoa! Oh, God, today's the day.
I haven't been this nervous since Diane was vacuuming during a thunderstorm on the Fourth of July, I had to take a bath, and there was a stranger in our yard.
There's no need to be nervous, or calm for that matter because you've already lost.
We're 1,600 signatures short and the clock runs out at 9:00 AM.
So it's gonna take a miracle, huh? [BUZZER BLARING.]
Oh, no! It's over.
Everyone can get out of my house now.
Ooh, tough break, kid.
We're all in shock.
McG! Are you still looking for a star for your transgender Teddy Roosevelt Planes, Trains and Automobiles reboot, Plans, Trans, A Man, A Canal, Panama? Because someone just became available.
Whoa! Whoa! I don't understand what happened.
Let me put it in terms your dumb dog brain can comprehend.
All your life people have been throwing you bones because they like you, but everyone has a ceiling to their likability.
This is a bone you can't have, because people just don't like you enough.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You know, it's funny.
Personally I like Woodchuck and he's a fine governor, but for some reason, even though I have zero qualifications, I honestly thought I would have made an even better governor.
Well, what matters is you tried.
But I would have been good, right? Now that there's no chance you will ever be governor, I can tell you honestly Yes.
You would have been great.
[CHUCKLES.]
Stop.
But seriously, though, elaborate.
You care about people, you follow your heart.
Those are important qualities you should never give up on.
So what you're saying is I shouldn't give up? On those qualities.
Yeah.
Never concede.
Stick it out, stay in the race.
Uh no Uh, maybe we should get Katrina's two cents on this.
Katrina? Race.
That's it, Diane! You diabolical Thin Mint.
You, and only you, are responsible for the great thing I am about to do.
Katrina? [APPLAUSE.]
[DEEP BREATH.]
Thank you, thank you.
Moments ago I found myself in what seemed to be a no-win situation.
But it turns out it was a "Nguyen situation.
" I'm referring of course to my supportive wife Diane Nguyen, who told me to never give up! [GROANS.]
And that's why I am challenging Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
What? No more petitions or fancy ballot initiatives, just a mano a mano, no-holds-barred slippery slalom down an ice-covered peak.
Winner gets to be governor, loser goes home.
Your move, Governor.
Mic drop! [FEEDBACK SQUEAL.]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Aaah! [CHEERING.]
[WOODCHUCK.]
What the hell is he talking about? It sounds like he's challenging you to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
What an absurd conceit.
Do I even need to respond to this? No, sir.
Because I'd rather focus on my drought relief optimization using geohydration technology, or DROUGHT plan.
If I know anything, this story will go away in a couple of days.
Now Mr.
Peanutbutter, you challenged Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.
Not just any ski race, a high-stakes dash down Devil's Mountain for the governorship itself.
But still no comment from the governor.
Why won't he race you? That's what I want to know.
You and me both, friendo.
But this isn't an us-ocracy, it's a dem-ocracy.
[AUDIENCE.]
Ooh! So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Any questions for the governor, folks? [AUDIENCE CHANTS.]
Why won't Woodchuck race? So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan is actually a drought relief plan.
I see now how that's confusing.
Any other questions? Are you going to race Mr.
Peanutbutter? Any questions about the DROUGHT plan? To ski or not to ski? That was the question posed by William Shakespeare and it's perhaps even more relevant today.
Of course, there are reasons why a gubernatorial election should not be decided by a ski race, but are there also reasons why it should? For the sake of "fairness" we've brought in two experts with opposite opinions who will now have equal time to just say those opinions because that's what news is.
You think they'll really race down Devil's Mountain? What do I care? As long as I've got my giant bag of kettle corn, that's the only thing that concerns me.
[TODD GRUNTS.]
[GASPS.]
What the? Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha! Get back here with my kettle corn! You can't call it a drone if you're riding on it.
Suckers! Hooray! Ha ha! Oh oh, no! Aw, man.
I was hoisted by my own petard, the one petard I thought would never hoist me.
[WOODCHUCK.]
Unprecedented poppycock.
This poppycock has no precedent.
Maybe it's time to make a statement.
Madeline, no.
This outlandish buffoonery is beneath the office of the governor.
I can't defile the legacy of my predecessors who built the Golden Gate Bridge, irrigated the Central Valley, and played Mr.
Freeze in a Batman movie.
Can't you see this thing is eating you alive? Do it for us, Woodcharles.
Do it for us.
[GROANS.]
And so this ski race would be both undemocratic and unconstitutional, which is why I will not be racing Mr.
Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.
What if the state constitution were changed to allow it? Then would you race Mr.
Peanutbutter? I [SIGHS.]
Fine.
If a state senator wanted to waste everybody's time by sponsoring an amendment to the constitution, and the motion got two-thirds majority in both houses so as to allow a democratically-elected governor to accept a ski race challenge for his office, then yes, I would race Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Well, I guess that puts that idea to bed, right? Hmm.
Right? Hmm [CHUCKLES.]
Right?! You want me to sponsor a ski race amendment to the constitution? Or you could sponsor the amendment that has a hidden rider doubling farm subsidies in your district.
Inglewood could use some farms.
That's right.
I do have these campaign donors uh, I mean, constituents who really care about babies' access to vaping devices.
[COUGHING.]
Uh-huh.
I've always wanted to drive across a bridge to Hawaii.
Can we do that? You got it.
Aloha! [GIGGLES.]
Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo! [CHUCKLES.]
It tickles.
[SIGHS.]
I'm astounded that it has come to this.
But since the exorbitantly expensive and astonishingly titled I Love California amendment is now law, I formally accept Mr.
Peanutbutter's challenge to a ski race.
It happens that I'm an excellent skier who won numerous medals in the sport when I raced for Dartmouth but, again, I am shocked that fact is relevant in the matter of selecting our state's governor.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I will see you on Devil's Mountain.
Whoa! This is insane.
You could actually become governor by winning a race.
Yeah.
Wow.
You know, it's days like this I wish I knew how to ski.
You don't ski? Never really got into it, no.
Then why did you challenge the governor to a ski race? [CHUCKLES.]
I didn't think it would get this far.
You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.
Well, I guess that's it.
Oh, well.
Tough break.
Bye forever, Katrina.
No, this is not over.
This is just beginning.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you're going to ski school.
Doggie-doggie what now? [DIANE.]
Hey, BoJack, it's me again.
Where are you, I'm worried, hope you're not dead, etc you get it.
Anyway, things are even crazier around here lately.
Don't know if you've seen the news, but I really wish you were here for this.
Well, I'm off to ski school so I can learn how to ski, so I can become the governor.
[DIANE.]
You'd say something like, "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
" Sounds great, sweetheart.
But as the old saying goes, that's politics.
[DIANE.]
Then you'd probably say, "A, that's not an old saying and, B, that's not politics! Nothing about that is politics.
" This is so great! Then you would be so overwhelmed by the unbearable ludicrousness of the situation that you would get in your car and drive to Hawaii, which is also a thing you could do now because of a new bill that cost our state billions of dollars.
It's all so great! [SIGHS.]
You know, it's funny, because the last time I saw you you told me that you needed me in your life, and then you just disappeared.
So how do you think that makes me feel? Well, wherever you are, I hope you're happy.
I really do, BoJack.
Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.
He's not with you, is he? [MUNCHING.]
Oh, simple kettle corn.
Between the worlds of the sweet and the savory.
Not quite popcorn, not quite candy.
What are we? [CAWING.]
Hey, get away! Get, get! [GASPING, CHOKING.]
Wow, my first day at ski academy.
What collegiate shenanigans will befall me? There will be no shenanigans on my watch.
Professor Thistlethorpe, the famously humorless yet somehow also lovable ski instructor? Peanutbutter, is it? Everything about you disgusts me.
Uh And yet, there might be something in you after all.
You really mean it? This shall be my greatest challenge.
Meet me on the summit tomorrow at daybreak.
Well, it is daybreak and here we are at the summit.
First lesson, break your skis in half.
Oh, I don't have skis.
Was I supposed to bring skis? You didn't say that.
No bother.
They shan't be required.
Instead, read this book of poetry.
I'll see you in the classroom.
Ah, there you are.
Did you read the book of poetry? No! I forgot to.
Excellent.
I'm sor Excellent? My assignment was a test.
Skiing isn't about reading old books.
It's about speaking truth to power Oh! and you have spoken it eloquently.
You are my finest student.
I love you.
[COUGHING.]
Are you okay, professor? Just a cough.
I'm sure it's nothing.
You can come by tomorrow for your diploma.
I can't believe ski school is already over.
Professor Thistlethorpe? Professor Thistlethorpe! [WEAKLY.]
Remember everything I taught you.
I will.
Also, if you have any tips for skiing, that would be really helpful.
The most important part of skiing is to keep your legs ben [SOBBING.]
Who's Ben? Devil's Mountain is the place, skiing is the sport.
I'm uncomfortable.
It's cold out.
Tell me, who do you think will win today's bout and what does it mean for the future of California? I hate winter sports.
I want to go inside and drink a cider.
[STARTER'S PISTOL FIRING.]
And they're off! [GRUNTS, YELLING.]
[TOM.]
Woodchuck, off to a great start.
Mr.
Peanutbutter seems to be employing some sort of awkwardly falling down technique.
Any sign of them? Nothing yet.
Oh! I made you a card.
You did? [CHUCKLES.]
Oh, wow, it's sparkly.
Sorry, I went a little overboard with the glitter and a little underboard with the glue.
[RALPH.]
"Let's move in together.
I think I'm ready now.
" This is great.
Are you sure, though, because last time you seemed a little hesitant.
No, I was just a little pregnant.
Oh! I was gonna tell you, really, but then before I could tell you there was nothing to tell you.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I still wish you would've told me.
I have a card for that.
On the front it says, "Life isn't fairage.
" I'm sorry.
I just felt dumb because all my life I've wanted a family.
But I didn't want it to happen just because I got pregnant by accident and then you got stuck with me.
Okay, first of all, if I get stuck to something, you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.
You know what I mean.
Second, if that's how you feel, maybe you shouldn't get pregnant by accident.
Well, I didn't try to! No.
I'm saying maybe we should get you pregnant on purpose.
Really? Yeah.
We love each other, and we enjoy having sex with each other and we're good at having sex with each other.
And also, I think you'd be an amazing mother.
[SIGHS.]
Even Blake Lively thinks so.
Ah, still got it.
Yes! [GRUNTING, YELLING.]
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho! Ohh! Get control.
Woodchuck in the lead, still in the lead.
Woodchuck remains very much in the lead.
Goodbye, dear friend.
You served me well.
[GASPS.]
Okay, all right, here we go.
Mr.
Peanutbutter? Ohh! [YELLING.]
[GRUNTING, GASPING.]
[YELLING.]
[GASPING.]
[PANTING.]
I see Woodchuck! Yes! Go, Woodcharles! Oh whoa [GRUNTS.]
Whoa! Oh, my God.

Ow, ow, ow, ow! [GRUNTS.]
[CROWD CHEERING.]

Ooh! Ooh.
[MOANING.]
Oh ohh.
Did I win? Come on, honey.
Let's go home.
[APPLAUSE.]
Well, I hope that settles it.
We can finally put an end to this nonsense.
Sir, the rules are clear: the first person to cross the finish line becomes governor, and, well, a strange boy fell out of the sky and crossed the line first.
They're swearing him in now.
So help me Todd.
Congratulations, Governor Chavez.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
You know, ever since I first became governor I've thought, "I don't want to be governor" and that's where I am now.
So, can I not be governor? [GROANING AND GASPING.]
You'd like to resign? Yeah.
I'm just really not into labels right now.
Maybe after some soul searching I'll be ready to really know what I am.
But for right now, I think I speak for all Californians when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn while drifting through the sky on an out of control drone throne.
" Okay, is this charade over? Can I be governor again? Sir, we live in a society of laws.
When a governor resigns, that triggers a special election.
Until which, the governor's seat shall remain vacant.
[ALL GASPING.]
Election, you say? Mr.
Peanutbutter, will you run? You bet I will, and you know why? No, tell me.
Because this whole ski race was a joke.
Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.
He went to Dartmouth.
So where's the candidate for regular schmoes like me, who went to Northwestern? Is he serious right now? You know, Governor Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz thinks he's better than us, but is he better than us? [CROWD.]
No! Uh, if I could say a few words He thinks the race is over.
Well, I say it's just starting.
And he wants me to sit and stay and roll over? No! I say California's tired of rolling over.
What do you say? [CROWD.]
Yeah! [WOMAN.]
I'm tired.
I say it's time for me to stand up and speak.
[CHEERING.]
Diane-Diane what now? So loud as you can, let me hear what you want.
[CHANTING.]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! Uh, citizens I can't hear you! Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! [NERVOUS CHUCKLE.]

Then after a long day of killing Nazis we'll sit in a beer garden and enjoy a pint.

What?! Why would you get Paul Giamatti to play me meaty roles like that one? Hey, buddy, is any of that to fix the door? What do you care? I don't.
And if it were up to me, that old house would've been torn down years ago.
It's a blight on the neighborhood.
And that broken door is the cherry on the top of the shit sandwich.
What kind of a sandwich has cherries on top? A shitty one.
How about fixing your door instead of my metaphor? Ow! [GRUNTS.]

Oh, Joseph, I failed him.
Oh, Doc, I let her down.

I have to ask, are you BoJack Horseman? No.

Or he was, yeah, before he gave it all up for a life of quiet anonymity.
Where is he? Nobody knows.
Perhaps a small town just like this one.
Perhaps he's even in this very room.
But he's not, 'cause I'm not BoJack Horseman.
Okay.
What I was going to ask was if you were related to Joseph Sugarman, or if you were just squattin' in his house? My grandfather.
I used to come here in the summers when I was a kid.
Hasn't got much use in the last 25 years, except for the termites.
Get on out of here, Bobby and Susan! I saw you gnawin'! Yeah, well, there isn't any more of us.
I'm the last of my line.
Once my mother dies and I die that'll be it, which is probably for the best.
No more of you? [CHUCKLES.]
That'll be great.
Oh, thank you.
That was the reaction I was going for.
[SANDER SCRAPING.]
I guess that's it.
Have a nice life, Hambone.
Why'd you call me Hambone? You told me that's your name: Hambone Fake-name-ington.
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
This is the first summer we'll spend here without him.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
But, as they say, time's arrow marches forward.
You hear that, honey? Time's arrow marches.
[SONG MELODY, SLOWLY.]
[SOBBING, SIGHS.]
Ohh Well, I'd love to stay, but I must be going.
As a modern American man I am woefully unprepared to manage a woman's emotions.
I was never taught, and I will not learn.
Take care, you two.
[PANTING.]
[TIRES SCREECHING.]
[SOBBING.]
[PLAYING DIFFERENT MELODY.]
Huh.
Look at this.
Yes, you have a very attractive mother.
What? No.
Why would I? Forget that.
Look at that weather vane.
Ah.
The house isn't finished yet.
We can't stop till we find that weather vane.
Ooh! I know where this is.
Oh.
Uh, all right.
[EDDIE.]
Oh, lordy.
[CHUCKLING.]
A bit more is that it? Oh, yeah, that's right.
Oh.
[EDDIE CHUCKLING.]
Hey, there it is! Oh, hey! You can't be in here! Why'd you say you can't fly? Who's that other person you're clearly in love with? I never said I can't fly, I said I don't fly.
If you want help with that weather vane you'll clam up, Hambone! Fine.
Keep your stupid secret about your clearly dead wife and your probably-related dumb fear of flying.
See if I care.
["STARS & STRIPES FOREVER" PLAYING.]
[FIREWORKS POPPING.]
[BEATRICE GASPS AND COOS.]
What are those fireworks for, Mother? Those are because the war is over.
We've dropped bombs on Japan and now everyone is happy.
Shouldn't we be celebrating? Yes.
Yes! Let's paint the town scarlet, crimson, and ruby! Why, I've got half a mind to paint things redder than the banks of Normandy! Ha ha! What? Too soon? The Crab Brothers who run this place are total scavengers.
If it can be pinched, they'll pilfer it.
Ooh! It's still there! I'll make a distraction at the piano, you climb up, get the weather vane.
Oh, of course, the twelve hundred [MUFFLED MUTTERING.]
pound horse will shimmy up a drain pipe to get it, that makes more sense than the dragonfly, who has the word "fly" in the name of what he is.
Okay, all right, so you've gone now.
You walked away, while I make my point.
Mother, can I get a freezy pop? Sure, darling.
You can have whatever you want.
Attention, everyone! I'm gonna play a song now, so look at me! Do not look up at the roof of that barn! [GRUNTS.]
Idiot.
[PLAYING MELODY.]
I will always think of you I see your face When each day's through And days go past Oh, so fast [TOGETHER.]
But memories, they last Huh.
Summer, winter, year by year Year by year I'll hear this song Inside my ear Try to restart That'd be smart [TOGETHER.]
But thoughts of you Haunt my heart No, I don't want to be alone now Oooh Oooh Just biding my time I need somebody dearly And darling, you'd be sublime [HONEY.]
Spring and autumn, up and down [EDDIE.]
Up and down I keep trying to escape this town And I just might I'll take flight [TOGETHER.]
Maybe tomorrow, not tonight [LIGHT APPLAUSE.]
Mother? Oh! [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING.]
[GASPS.]
[GULPING.]
Ahh! Sal! Oh, Sally! Oh! Mrs.
Sugarman.
What happened when he got shot? Was it quick? Did he suffer? Hey, Eddie, come on.
Eddie, let's go! [SOBBING.]
Hey! That's not yours! Yeah! We stole that fair and square.
Mrs.
S.
Please, please tell me.
Please.
Mrs.
Sugarman, control yourself.
[SOBBING.]
[BOJACK.]
Aaah! Hey, gimme that! [HONEY WAILING.]
Please! Mother? Why did everybody stop, huh? What's the gag? I want to dance.
I want to fly! [SOBBING.]
Listen, you're sloshed and making a scene.
Do the responsible thing: have one more drink to steady your nerves and then drive yourself and your young daughter home.
Don't make me go back to that quiet house, please.
Mother, let's go.
Eddie, let's go! Are you all right? It's okay.
I'm okay.
My hands are doing the wiggly doozle in three-four time, but Say, I got a swell idea.
Why don't you drive? But I don't know how.
Why, it's only as easy as finding a hobo in a barrel of beans.
It'll be grand.
Everything will be just grand.
[BOJACK LAUGHING.]
[EDDIE.]
Whoo! [SHOUTING.]
Get back here! Aaah! [GASPS.]
Jeepers! [SOBBING.]
Yeah! We're hooligans! Faster.
I want to feel alive again.
I'd do anything to feel alive.
[SCREAMING.]
[METAL CRUNCHING.]
[EDDIE LAUGHING.]
I gotta say, you really knew how to handle those salad tongs for someone who appears to have never eaten a salad.
Yeah? Well, you got a nice set of pipes.
You're like a Josh Groban who doesn't also think he's funny.
[GRUNTS.]
Okay, now, the house is absolutely, totally finished.
Wow.
I wish I could somehow pay you back for all your help.
Don't sweat it.
Hey, Eddie.
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa! [CRASHING.]
Ow! [GROANS.]
What are you doing? What the hell'd you do that for? I don't know, I thought you would fly to save me and by making you fly I would, in a sense, be saving you! How many times do I have to tell you? I don't fly! You're flying right now, asshole! [GASPS, GROANS.]
Why'd you make me do that? [GROANS.]
You're welcome.
I haven't flown since Lorraine died, and now you ruined it.
Okay.
Obviously, this was not the preferred outcome for either of us.
You want to fly? All right, let's fly.
[GRUNTS.]
Oh, shit.
No, I'm fine, actually.
You want to go higher? You want to see how high we can go? Clearly, this is a sore subject.
I was wrong to bring it up.
Let's go back down.
The night Lorraine died she wanted to go back, but I wanted to see how high we could go.
Whoa! Plane! Look out! You want to know how Lorraine felt when she got sucked into that engine? We're all just tiny bugs, right? [GROANING.]
Aaaah! [PANTING.]
Oh, God.
No, no, come on.
Come on.
[COUGHING.]
Are you insane?! I don't want to live! Why did you save me? [SOBBING.]
I don't want to live! [CRYING.]
What were you thinking, hoofing around the dance floor like a motorized freckle? Did you snap your cap? You mustn't despise me, darling.
Please.
That's before mentioning poor Beatrice.
You aiming to get her killed as well? She's all we got.
Oh, don't be cross with Mother! I don't know what's wrong with me.
How am I supposed to sell sugar and keep my secretary's self-esteem afloat when you're having honest-to-goodness fits of hysteria? Don't yell, Father.
I just can't anymore.
I can't stop thinking about him.
I can't be with people and I can't be alone.
I don't know how to be better, Joseph.
Please fix me.
I want to be better.

BoJack? Where are you? Are you okay? [PANTING.]
I don't know.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Talk to me.
What's going on? [BOJACK.]
It's Michigan, and it's beautiful here, and everything sucks.
Michigan? BoJack, come home.
I can't.
I don't belong there, I don't belong anywhere.
But that's the thing, everybody belongs in Los Angeles.
There's, like, no barrier for entry.
Oh, God, that's true.
[SIGHS.]
They do let in just anybody.
I was at a coffee shop yesterday, I heard a guy trying to impress someone by soft-pitching a web series he crowdfunded.
Let me guess: the web series is about how funny he and his friends are, just, like, hanging out.
He described it as HBO's Girls but, like, from a guy's perspective.
What?! And he's just giving this away for free in a coffee shop? Somebody get this guy an overall! Well, the important thing is that barista's definitely going to have sex with him later.
[CHUCKLING.]
I've missed you, Diane.
I've missed you, too.
Mmm.
[SLURPING.]
Is Mother okay? She is now.
She just let her womanly emotions get the better of her, that's all.
Nothing a little operation couldn't fix.
Operation? What's broken in the heart can never be repaired, but the brain, well, we have all sorts of science for the brain.
She's a brand new woman now, and she'd like to meet you very much.
[NOTE PLAYS.]
Mother? Oh, hello.
It's Beatrice.
Yes, that's right.
What a pretty girl.
What did they do to you? [SOBS.]
Oh, hush.
It's okay.
I'm better now.
I don't understand.
Love does things to a person, terrible things.
[SNIFFLES, SIGHS.]
Beatrice, promise me you'll never love anyone as much as I loved Crackerjack.
I promise.
I won't.
Why, I have half a mind [TRUCK ADVANCING, BEEPING.]
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
There we go, big boy.
Hey, what's going on out here? Probably should have warned you, when these guys tear the house down it might make some noise.
Tear the house down?! Uh, yeah.
You think I just want to mope around in a shrine to the past, getting off on my own guilt while the rest of my life passes me by? Pathetic, much? But we spent the last eight months restoring this place.
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.
That's usually a series wrap on a friendship.
What is a series wrap? Are you serious? Oh, my God, what am I doing in this backwash of a town? Do you even get Showtime here? So what was all this for? I don't know.
Guess it was just a big waste of time.
But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right? I don't believe this.
Well, as a great woman once said, suck a dick, dumbshit.
[GRUNTS.]
Where are you going? Home.
[GLASS SHATTERS.]
[SMASHING, CLATTERING.]
Oh.
He'll be here.
But his part is in 16 bars.
Excuse me.
Sorry! I heard before he played triangle he was in a prison gang.
I heard he was a tech millionaire.
There is a rumor he is a foreign prince.
His name is Todd Chavez.
And he's the most giving man the world has ever known.
He saved my pregnant daughter from drowning in a shipwreck, then he delivered her baby while they rode on a piece of driftwood.
And then he circumcised her baby while they both hung from the ladder of the rescue helicopter.
Of course, before he did, Todd Chavez explained that circumcision has somewhat fallen out of vogue.
They had a spirited but respectful debate, and by the end my daughter decided that since we are of Jewish heritage, the boy might like to have the option to become religious if he so chooses.
Sounds like he really helped your daughter make the decision that was right for her family.
And last year, when our triangle player died of starvation after getting his foot stuck in his triangle, Todd Chavez took over because we needed him.
What a guy! He is always helping others.
You know, sometimes when that triangle part is coming up, I find myself hoping he won't show up.
No man should be asked to give that much.
He is truly the best of all of Whoa! Oh, hey, guys.
I was eating a taco earlier and I got salsa on my shirt.
I went to clean it off, but then when I put my hands in the automatic dryer I forgot I was still holding the taco.
I got my hands all greasy, so I couldn't open the doorknob for an hour.
What you guys talking about? So then at 11:00 you're gonna be giving a policy speech on fracking.
Fracktastic! Meanwhile, all this talk of whatever it is you're talking about is making me hungry.
Mmm? Cheese? Yes, please! Todd, don't distract Mr.
Peanutbutter with your weird pocket cheeses.
The issue is fracking and the people really want to know your opinion.
Well, then, color me "the people" because I would also like to know my opinion.
You don't have one yet.
The polling research comes in today and that will decide whether you're for or against fracking.
Here's a thought: maybe be against fracking.
It's terrible! Diane.
Just my opinion.
You don't tell me how to do my job.
Also, fracking is the worst.
I can't believe you'd even consider endorsing it.
Diane.
None of my business.
Gotta get to work.
Love you! Bye, hon! But seriously, seriously, if you come out in support of fracking I'm gonna be super upset.
Bye! Where you stand on the issue doesn't really matter.
What's important is that you seem sincere and emphatic.
Ohh.
Are you a fan of charming but inessential Will Smith movies? Because, slight Hitch, I always show I'm empathic by taking off my glasses dramatically, but I kinda lost them.
Wow! This must be what I'd look like to a starving shipwrecked person.
When did you last see the glasses? I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.
She was saying I'm always forgetting stuff, so I whipped off my glasses, looked her square in the eye and said, "I never forget a thing.
" I might have left my glasses there.
Todd, you never do anything.
Why don't you take the campaign bus over to VIM and get Mr.
Peanutbutter's glasses? Can you handle that? I never know if I can handle anything.
That's what makes my life so exciting.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, there's a delivery! He's busy! Just sign for it.
I can't sign for another man's mail.
That's how I ended up with the cremains of Cornelius Vanderbilt.
It all started when a young Todd I don't have time for this! I've got a job to do.
It's Todd! It's me! You are just the guy I need.
You know the actress Courtney Portnoy? I think so.
She portrayed the formerly portly consort in The Seaport Resort? Courtly roles like the formerly portly consort are Courtney Portnoy's forte, but she's got a new action movie that's supposed to change her image: Ms.
Taken.
You know Mr.
Taken from the Taken movies? This is his niece.
Nice! This was supposed to be Courtney's crossover coronation.
But that's sort of been thwarted, unfortunately, 'cause Courtney's purportedly falling short of shoring up four-quadrant support.
Makes perfect sense so far.
The public sees her as out of touch.
We need to make her seem relatable, and the best way to do that is to be seen dating a down-to-earth boring nobody like yourself.
You can do that, right? You're not doing anything.
I'm kind of busy today.
I gotta pick up these glasses, and then tonight there was this meeting I wanted to go to.
This will take no time, I promise.
Meet her for lunch.
The paparazzi will show up, pop some razzis.
I do love getting my picture taken.
It's proof I exist.
Marvelous! Judah, prepare the press release.
"Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy.
" Well, we didn't get the polling research on fracking Here you go.
Thank you.
Because apparently when the delivery came someone wouldn't sign for it.
Ooh.
In the future, whenever anyone asks you to sign Mr.
Peanutbutter's name, just sign it.
You got it, chief.
All right, Middle-Aged Yeller, here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna give an impassioned speech on fracking that doesn't actually take a stand either way on fracking.
Okay.
Good morning! Let's talk fracking.
Everyone has very strong opinions about it, and I want you all to know, right here and right now, I am taking a stand.
I am on your side! What side is that, specifically? Good question.
I am specifically on the side of the facts, and also on the side of feelings.
Well, I'm satisfied.
Oh, excuse me, would Mr.
Peanutbutter be willing to sign this letter to our state government? Yes.
I'll write his name on anything.
Oh, thank you so much.
And down goes Todd.
And up comes Todd! Aah! Whoa! Stay back! Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.
My name is Hollyhock Manheim-MannheimGuerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your first name? Hollyhock.
And your last name? Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-RobinsonZilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
Got it.
Wait, what's your last name? I know, it's confusing.
I have eight dads.
How'd that happen? Test tubes? No.
I was adopted.
Oh, of course.
By eight men in a committed gay polyamorous relationship.
Less of course.
But ever since I was a baby, people always said I looked like BoJack Horseman.
That's a terrible thing to say to a baby! And I've always wondered if BoJack could be my biological sperm guy.
I guess it's possible.
BoJack used to say his penis is like sun-dried tomatoes: back in the '90s it got into everything.
I came to L.
A.
to get to the bottom of things.
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.
Sorry about knocking you out.
Once you have chloroform, you can't not use it.
No, I get it.
BoJack had one of those spy kits, too.
He mostly just used the chloroform on himself, though.
I read in his book that you live together.
Can you help me find him? Sorry.
I don't live there anymore.
And no one knows where he's been for the last year.
I guess I don't have to meet him.
All I need is a DNA sample, like a piece of hair or something.
I guess his house might have Whoa! Sorry again.
It's just so fun.
Okay, there might be some hairs in the shower drain, but hard to know who they belong to.
Everyone who has sex with BoJack usually takes a long shower afterwards.
Hey, I think I see a hair.
Oh, no, BoJack.
Yoink! What the was Okay.
Okay, let's blow.
Blow? Who's got blow? Save some for BoJack.
Huh? Wait, Todd? Oh, shit.
Are you gonna yell at me? Can I have the blow first? No.
BoJack, there's no blow, okay? And I'm not going to yell at you.
And what is this? I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-RobinsonZilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
Of the New Haven ManheimMannheim-Guerrero-RobinsonZilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks? That was a joke.
Obviously, I've never heard of your family and/or law firm.
That was also a joke.
Todd, who is this tough crowd you brought to my home? Um, BoJack, this is your daught Mm-mmm, mm-mmm! dot-dot maid.
Way to build up the suspense.
To, uh, tidy up the place in case you came back.
You got me a maid? Thank you.
Here I thought Channing Tatum was a good neighbor for picking up my mail while I was gone, but you, and after all the things I did to you, I don't know how to tell you BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year, and that's actually been kind of working for me.
So, maybe it's better if we just keep things like that, you know? Oh.
Okay.
So then why did you hire me Oh, yeah, deliver me.
You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.
Can you tell me if this is a match? A match with who? Hollyhock.
Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub Zoolander-Hallelujahsomething-McDonald's? Whatever those words are, I need a sample from her, too.
Duh! Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.
Nothing like working with hair, blood, and semen all day to work up an appetite, and it's already 1:00.
1:00? I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend! Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too? Mine is a bunch of water balloons with a blonde wig.
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this is too fancy for a common man such as yourself.
No, it's fine.
You'd probably like to take me someplace rough and primitive.
Uh do you want me to take you somewhere else? Well, if you must drag me on some barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.
There's a Pony Roma's at Universal CityWalk.
A chain restaurant? Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.
I can't do this.
Todd, I can never be your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.
I must abscond.
Wait, Courtney! Scusi, sir, would you care for a sample of my father's famous angel hair pomodoro? Famous father? Hair? Sample? DNA? I no say DNA.
I gotta get back to Hollyhock.
Hollyhock, I need to get Did you clean anything? No.
But I am learning so much about my possibly-maybe birth father.
Like, did you know he has a shoebox in his closet full of bad reviews for other people's TV shows? So all you've done so far is snoop around? I also ate a box of donuts, got sleepy and took a nap.
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need to do this DNA test.
Look, I didn't come all this way to not find out who my biological father is.
Okay, fine, then I just need you to yank out a strand of hair so I can take it down to the lab.
No way! That sounds painful.
Can't we just use your hair? Um No.
No, but I can pull out some of my hair at the same time, so you don't have to do it alone.
Okay, that sounds fair.
On three, we pull.
One two three! Ow! Oh, wait, I have this whole comb full of hair in my bag.
Duh! Todd, can I see you for a minute? This maid is the worst.
I passed out again for some reason.
When I woke up, the house was messier than when she started.
I don't mind someone else in the house with me, in case I start choking on pills or have a funny take on current events that demands an audience, but if she can't do her job, I gotta fire her.
You can't do that! Here, buzz up real nice, take a nap, and while you're sleeping, I'll get the maid to clean so no one has to fire anyone.
Well, we did it.
What? I'm helping.
I'm cleaning out his DVR.
Get it? Okay, but you got it, right? To-To-To-Todd! Todd's phone, home of the Todd.
You quarter-wit.
Turn on the news.
I don't want to be a manners police, but a "hello" would be nice.
The letter, signed by Mr.
Peanutbutter himself, in full, unambiguous support of fracking.
Ooh.
The gubernatorial hopeful has until now played coy on the controversial issue of fra What happened? Randy pass out on his keyboard? Oh, he did? Oh, my God, is he okay? Well, did someone call Cynthia? No one called Cynthia?! For Christ's sake, this isn't just a newsroom, this is a family! Jeez, I hope Randy's okay.
Forget Randy.
Did you sign that letter for Mr.
Peanutbutter? Yes.
Should I have not done the thing you literally told me to do? Well, I guess we're pro-fracking now.
Hey, buddy, I just want you to know that while Katrina is filled with white-hot frustration as she has been for much of this campaign, I'm not mad.
I'm just nervous about what Diane will do when she finds out.
But I've got a plan, and it stars you! What? You want me to keep Diane away from the TV, radio, and Internet? Ohh! That's a way better idea than I had.
Yeah, do that.
Hollyhock, I gotta run.
I'll try to get the hairs tested today.
Just stay here and act maid-like.
Ah, okay.
Hey, look at me! I'm dancing.
The time is now! Don't miss out! Okay, Todd, that's some good dancing, but I've got work to do and you've been dancing for 55 minutes?! What is this? It's a new dance.
I call it the come on, stall, Todd.
Gotta think of something to call this fake dance you just made up.
Samba.
That's amazing, and you're amazing, and I want your pores.
Diane, I adored your sad little story on refugees.
We have so many articles about things people care about.
It's like supes refreshing to see something that doesn't make you click, but it does make you think.
Well, it's not like nobody clicks on my articles.
You don't care if people read your work or not.
That's what's so brave about you.
You inspire me to be my fiercest self.
Buh-buh-buh-bye! To-To-To-Todd! Todd's phone.
I know when that Toddline bling.
What happened at the restaurant? You disappeared before the paparazzi even got there.
The whole point was to get a picture with her.
Oh! Oops.
Uh, you want me to draw a picture from memory? How tall is she? What is she, like, eight feet? Okay, plan B.
She's gonna be at the Sharc Jacobs fashion show in 30 minutes.
There's an empty seat there for her boyfriend, you.
Be there, get the photo.
Got it? Click.
So, I gotta go.
How do I make people care about important stuff when all they want to do is read articles about who got slayed and who owned at the VMAs? When I need Mr.
Peanutbutter to take his heartworm pills, I always hide it in cheese so he doesn't know he's doing something he hates.
What if you take your important stuff and hide it in some juicy gossip? That's actually a really good idea.
But I don't know any gossip and I wouldn't even know where to look.
The Internet? No! Look at me! Because I have potentially earth-shattering inside info! That beloved famous person, uh Channing Tatum may have an illegitimate daughter that's also a Cordovian refugee.
Are you serious? I have these two hairs.
One is from Channing, the other is from a baby.
If the DNA lab confirms a match, you have your story.
Thanks, Todd.
I owe you one.
Okay, but if it's a match, please call me first.
'Cause, uh 'cause I love juicy gossip.
Where am I supposed to go? Okay.
"El Entrance?" Gracias, sign.
Muy bien.
Um Good heavens! What's this? Uh okay.
And this is how I walk He's so normal.
Uh hmm uh Where's the hollow look of someone forced to starve themselves to fit our unrealistic expectation of what beauty should be? He is not making it work.
No! Wait! Huh? Isn't fashion supposed to be for everyone? That behatted boy is right.
Fashion was never meant to be an inherently elitist form.
We need to return fashion to its utilitarian roots.
Give it back to the people! Bravo! He is making it work.
To-To-To-Todd! Todd's phone.
Leave a message at the Todd.
The DNA matched! Looks like a wide variety of screen roles isn't the only thing Channing brought life to.
It's a match? I gotta tell Holly Woo agents to keep their eyes peeled for a refugee baby with abs to die for.
Nick, tell Janae to stock the warehouse with red hoodies.
This is the look of the future.
Couch-surfer couture! Where's Hollyhock? I need to talk to her.
She's in maid heaven.
She's dead?! Sorry, I meant she belongs in maid heaven because she is a cleaning angel.
Where is she? I sent her to Channing Tatum's house to pay him back for collecting my mail while I was out of town.
Looks like I missed quite a deal at Pottery Barn.
Life is but an endless series of missed opportunities, some involving Pottery Barn.
Okay, I'm gonna Can you believe this? Mr.
Peanutbutter's running for governor.
I can believe it, because I've been around for the last year.
Right.
How's Diane feel about that? You could ask her yourself.
Does she even know you're back? I wanted to call her, but I'm just not ready.
Nobody knows I'm back except you.
And Channing Tatum, and my pills guy, and my booze guy, my weed guy, my coke guy, some smartass at Pizza Hut who deserved an in-person finger-wagging, and my maid.
And now she's at Channing Tatum's house? I came back because I wanted to fix things, but now I don't know if I can.
Uh-huh.
I've been so lucky to have people in my life who care about me.
I don't deserve any of them.
I definitely don't deserve to have a friend as amazing and generous and forgiving and thoughtful as Yeah? Oh.
Channing Tatum.
I'm only gonna hurt him like I've hurt everyone else.
I was a fool to think I could just jump back into a new relationship.
Can you go over to Channing Tatum's house, tell him I won't be his friend? I can't break another heart.
Not today, not Channing.
Okay.
Hollyhock, I need to tell you something.
Did you get the results? 'Cause I'm really looking forward to dropping this whole maid thing, even though I'm kind of nailing it.
Are you sure you want to know? I don't know if BoJack is ready for a normal relationship with anyone.
Oh.
Well, that's fine.
I don't want a relationship.
I already have eight dads.
It's not like a ninth dad is what I need to suddenly fill a hole in my life that the unconditional love of eight dads couldn't already fill.
Well, then good news.
I got the results and It's not a match.
Oh.
Really? Yeah.
Good news, right? I shouldn't have come here.
Papa Steve told me this was a bad idea.
But Papa Greg said, "Follow your heart.
" Then Papa Dashawn said, "I agree with Greg.
" Daddy Quackers said, "Let's put it to a vote, quack-quack.
" Hello? Anybody home? Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.
I can hear someone in there.
Channing? Jenna Dewan? Their daughter, Everly Elizabeth? Uh, it's me Channing Tatum.
I'm in the middle of, uh, Channing right now, but you can come back Tatum? Listen, I'm a reporter.
I tested your DNA against another sample's DNA, and apparently the two are related.
You're a father.
Wait, what? Okay.
Thanks! Todd.
I was going to write a story and drag your name through the mud just because I thought a couple more people would click on an article I wrote.
But I don't think that's the kind of journalist I want to be.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this line of work.
Sorry to bother you.
Uh Hey, I obviously don't know you because I am Channing Tatum, the guy from Green Lantern or whatever, and you are a nobody, but you came all the way over here to warn me about something you hadn't even written yet.
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum, I'd say you're exactly the kind of journalist we need in this world.
Wow! That doesn't sound at all like Channing Tatum's voice, but that is the kind of thing I would want Channing Tatum to say to me, so thanks, Channing.
Love half your movies! That was a close one, huh, Hollyhock? Hollyhock? To-To-To-Todd! Todd's phone.
What do you want? So, I see lots of pictures of you at the fashion show, but none of you with Courtney.
Oh, crap! Hi.
Oh, hello.
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes? These aren't anything like your clothes.
This hat alone cost $50,000.
Oh.
So, uh What's it like being a movie star? It's awfully trying.
Do you ever feel like everyone's looking at you but nobody sees you? Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.
No, I was speaking rhetorically about a feeling that only movie stars get.
Ohh.
Okay.
But it feels good to talk about it.
Yeah.
Talking's good.
You know, there was a meeting I was supposed to go to tonight, but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.
Ready for what? What if it's not everything I want it to be? Sometimes the idea of something is better than the truth, you know? I always prefer fiction to truth, personally.
I've staked my career on it.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Ha hah! Smile for the birdie.
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling with a supermodel now? That's right.
Fancy.
I love how not down-to-earth you are together.
This is going to really make headlines when you two break up.
Here's an even bigger headline: we shan't be breaking up.
We're engaged! Wowee! Hooray! I'm confused! Hollyhock? Are you here? No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um Hollyhock is your daughter.
What do you mean? She's your daughter.
I don't understand.
She has Horseman DNA.
What is that mean? You're her father.
That's impossible.
I'm BoJack.
She didn't want me to tell you, but I thought you should know.
I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.
BoJack Look what I do to people I'm supposed to care about.
I had sex with the one person I've ever seen you be in love with.
I guess they're not gonna put you in the best friends hall of fame, but I don't know that I loved her.
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.
Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.
All you ever asked for was a roof over your head and the occasional s'more in a baguette.
I'm telling you, it's a million-dollar idea.
I got more of you than I ever deserved.
If you never talk to me again I just want you to know that I appreciate it, and I appreciate you.
Thanks.
It was shitty what you did with Emily, but, um I think I'm Asexual.
A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant? Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen? No.
Asexual, not sexual.
Ohh.
I'm sure you think that's weird.
Are you kidding? That's amazing.
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.
Maybe then I wouldn't have a strain of herpes.
You have multiple strains I know.
The joke only works with the "a".
It actually feels nice to finally say it out loud.
I am an asexual person.
I am asexual.
That's great.
So if you're not mad about Emily It wasn't just Emily, BoJack, and I don't know if I'm ready for us to be friends again yet.
Oh.
Okay.
But we can be more than not-friends.
You know, for an asexual, more than not-friends is probably as good as it gets, right? I'm not really at a place yet where I want to joke about it.
Got it, got it, totally.
But it feels good to talk about it.
Well, if you ever need a place to crash, that couch I'm gonna go.
Oh.
Right now? Welcome back, BoJack.
It's good to see you.
Uh Hmm.
Todd? Hmm.
Good for him.
Let me be the first to tell you: I'm bad news.
You're actually not the first to tell me that.
I can't offer you parental guidance or advice or love or support or prolonged conversation or interest in you, or remembering your name.
It's Hollyhock.
And I'm not looking for another dad.
Great.
But I've always wanted to know who my mother is.
Your mother? What do I look like, Josh Radnor? Nothing? Nothing for Josh Radnor.
How quickly we forget.
Just tell me the name of the woman you had sex with in December 1999.
That's all the relationship we need to have.
That was quite a time for our nation, sex-wise Oh, 1999 Actually, I don't need a whole long story.
Just get to the point.
The point is I banged a lot of women.
One-night stands, two-night stands, nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.
So, out of all of these women it sounds like you really respected, is there any chance one of them got pregnant and then put the baby up for adoption? I guess Marcy was kind of a poking holes in the condom type.
Real nutter.
Good lay, though.
Glad to hear my mother was a "nutter" and "a good lay.
" Can I meet her? Where is she? I bet she's still in that same apartment in the Valley.
What a dump! Can you take me there? Help me find my mom and I'll leave you alone forever.
Deal.
But can we go in the morning? It's getting pretty late, I become a real asshole if I don't get a solid seven hours of bed drinking a night.
I should get going.
My hostel's all the way downtown in a pretty bad area.
Wait.
Take this.
Okay.
Here I go, hope there are no murderers out.
Yes, everyone hopes that all the time.
Okay, just do me a favor.
Ugh! What now? If I do get murdered, will you call my eight dads and tell them I love them? I gotta call all eight? They can't work out a phone tree? If you're gonna be a baby, stay here for the night.
All right! Take the couch and be quiet.
Don't get on your phone and text all your friends how sweet my house is.
Turn off all the lights when you're going to sleep, all of the lights.
Thank you, BoJack.
Oh, I can't Oh, you're you're in my Wait, I'm not really What if we try Wait, I'm almost Oh, no.
I don't think it's going to happen.
I'm sorry, it's just difficult with all the Who gave Todd the air horn? Right.
Right.
The campaign.
Exactly.
But it's just another two months, right? After the election everything goes back to normal.
Well, unless I win.
Right.
I gotta tell you, I'm having a blast.
I always knew I was probably good at something, but I never knew what it was.
Thanks to Katrina, I've finally realized I'm good at people liking me.
That's great, and you know I'm so happy for you, but do you have to be the pro-fracking candidate? Diane, this is the campaign.
Nothing anyone says during a campaign matters.
It's just promising a bunch of stuff to get people to vote for you.
Then when you get an office, you can do whatever you want.
Democracy in action.
Mark my words The only fracking that's going to be happening is in this bedroom.
All right, guy.
I'm gonna drill you deep, and fill you with a mysterious substance that scientists still don't quite understand the ramifications of.
This isn't sexy for me aaah! Did someone say "busy day"? No one said "busy day," Katrina.
What did we say about knocking? It wastes vital seconds we'll never get back? Anyway, everyone who isn't me needs to shut up right now.
No one else was talking.
I actually have good news for once.
CNN released a poll today, and for the first time ever, Mr.
Peanutbutter is up.
Damn! Wow! Am I John Davidson, Cathy Lee Crosby and Fran Tarkenton right now, because that's We don't have time for the reference you're setting up.
We're doing a presser in 30.
Go downstairs, get some breakfast.
Yeah! Breakfast! Am I Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, the principal Just get breakfast! All right! Don't you forget about me.
Diane, you look sad.
We were kind of in the middle of No, I'm saying you look sad.
Maybe you need to put on foundation, blush around the cheeks or something.
What the? Huh? Aaah! Aaah! What's going on down here? I was trying to make you breakfast to thank you for letting me stay here! I put a Pop-Tart in the microwave! Did you take the foil off? No! I was doing it popcorn style! It's all right, it's not your fault.
Making food is impossible.
Let's get out of here and take you to your mom's house.
Should we do something about the fire? Just leave it.
It'll tire itself out eventually.
So, who is this lady? It's actually a cute story.
She was the president of my fan club.
You had sex with the president of your fan club? Yeah.
"Oh, my God, what a monster!" I slept with someone who loved me more than anybody else and dedicated her life to knowing things about me and caring about me.
How could I be so shallow? You're right, I'm sorry.
Finish your cute story.
That was the whole story.
She was the president of my fan club, I had sex with her.
Then I didn't think about her for 18 years, and here we are.
Good news, the results are in! Oh! Bad news, the results are bad.
Like an omelet bar at a mongoose convention, you are running dangerously low on eggs.
How many do I have left? Well, let's just say it's more than Harry Potter movies, but fewer than James Bond movies.
Doctor, no! What do you recommend? Hmm.
Have you considered impregnating a younger woman? No, I want to do it with this woman.
You could try throwing money at the problem.
You're gonna want pre-natal vitamins, cervical mucus boosters, a "You Can Do It!" poster, and an iOvulate.
"iOvulate"? Let's hope so! This state-of-the-art bracelet tracks your cycle and also gives you up-to-date info on your ovulation.
Plus, it's voiced by Harvey Fierstein.
Hello, I'm Harvey Fierstein.
Let's put a baby in you.
Ooh! BoJack? Marcy, hey.
I knew it.
I knew you'd come back.
Right.
Um Here's a very specific question: after we had sex, did you by any chance get pregnant and put a baby up for adoption? Yes.
Wait, really? Oh, my God, you're my mother.
Can I hug you? Oh.
I'm hugging my mother.
Wow.
BoJack, I'm sorry, I really wanted to tell you.
But when I called the number that you gave me, it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.
Wha? That's so weird.
You must have dialed it wrong.
And then I thought, well, you know, sooner or later you'd call me.
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna, but then, you know, 9/11 happened Can you ever forgive me? I think so.
Oh! I'm so sorry.
Where are my manners? Please come in.
And that was just such a tough time for our country So, once we introduced vicious knife-play into our routine, it really gave our sex life the edge.
Love it, crooshed it.
So the article is just about a happy marriage with a healthy sex life? We already have Raquel's piece about 69 days of sixty-nining.
Uh-huh! So croosh.
What about our readers who aren't having sex with their husbands? Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad? Not everyone gets to have great sex all the time, right? Ladies? Diane? Can I talk to you in your office for a minute? I don't have an office.
You said offices have corners and corners are the patriarchy.
Fine.
Can I talk to you in the hot-take, cool-down yoga area? You seem tense.
Have you been eating gluten and also not having sex with your husband? Whoa, Stefani, that's not Diane, relax! This is not a conversation between an employee and her superior.
This is a conversation between a friend and her superior.
The campaign has been testing our marriage.
Obviously, it's great to see Mr.
Peanutbutter so excited, and I am supporting that.
But if I'm being honest, I can't wait for it to be over so things can go back to normal.
Hmm.
And what happens if he wins? He's not going to win.
Did you see the new CNN poll this morning? He could win.
People do love fracking.
It's fun to say! "Frack! "Frack! Fricky-fricky-frack" People wouldn't love saying it if they understood what it actually was.
So tell them.
I can't go against my husband.
What the frack? Why not? You gotta do you, girl.
I always say, you gotta do you.
And if he's doing him, then who's doing you? Because right now, it seems like no one's doing you.
and then when I was eight, Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us all Freaky Friday for a sleepover, and I got really sad because I realized I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.
Am I talking a lot? I feel I'm talking a lot.
Yes.
Oh! I need to show you something.
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo, but I was so head over heels in love with your father that after we made sweet love, and he didn't call me again, I just got so jealous, so I made a list of every girl he was with and I found their home addresses Oh.
and drew Xs over their eyes.
I'm loving this conversation but I have to go the bathroom now, for non-me being weirded out by this conversation-related reasons.
I just keep thinking about how different things would have been if you'd have just called me.
We could have had a family together for 18 loving years.
That might have BoJack! Kids.
What? Can you join me in the bathroom for a minute? What?! No! Do you want me, sweetheart? No, it's a dad bathroom thing.
Uh Hollyhock? That woman is not my mother.
She's lying to us! Marcy? No way! Look.
This is from the premiere of "Autumn in New York".
That movie came out in August of 2000.
I was born in September.
Does this woman look eight months pregnant to you? Why would they release a romantic drama called "Autumn in New York" in the middle of summer? Richard Gere had just done "Runaway Bride", Winona Ryder was hot off "Girl, Interrupted" so the studio got cocky.
How do you know all this? I looked it up on the Internet because I saw this picture and got confused why Marcy would wear a summer dress to a movie called "Autumn in New York".
This is a summer dress? I guess I don't know dresses.
BoJack, focus! That's not my mom! So the lesson here is I was right to never call her.
Wait, so who Are you okay in there? Don't come in! Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time! The scrapbook! She has that list of all the other women you slept with.
If we get the book, we can find my mom.
Give me a few minutes.
I'll distract her, then you sneak in and grab the book.
Okay.
And what was the first appearance of the Horse's identical cousin? Season eight, episode four.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
What was the horse's boss's name? What are you doing? Oh, my God! You're not supposed to see this.
Look away! It's okay, Hollyhock.
This is what Mommy and Daddy do.
Ugh! You said give you a few minutes! I didn't think it would take this long.
I usually finish faster.
You're disgusting! That's what I needed.
Can I please have a grasshopper? Yes? So the studio finished "Mars Attacks"! Without him.
And since no one ever found a body, my client Tony Tromboni has been making movies under the name Tim Burton ever since.
Oh! I'm Harvey Fierstein.
Your ovulation window is closing soon.
Please commence copulation.
Oh, fish! We gotta go.
Can't we finish lunch? You heard the bracelet.
Okay, well, uh, let me get the check.
There's no time for that! Ralph! We gotta pay for our I have an egg inside me that is ripe to be fertilized.
His name is Philbert.
Princess Carolyn Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton, and he's going to be sweet and smart and a phenom on the clarinet, and one day you'll be driving him home from band practice and he's going to all of a sudden say something so insightful and true that you'll be positively floored it came out of the mouth of your son.
Wow.
But if you don't take me home right now and impregnate me, then Philbert will never exist.
Okay, let's go.
You told me to distract her.
We don't need to talk about it.
So now that we got the list, we gotta go see all these other women? Not all of them, just the ones you didn't see in the nine months after you had sex with them.
That's gonna be most of them.
Yeah, figures.
Ooh! Tilda Madison? You dated the Timedium, Tuesdays at 9:00 on CBS? I never understood that show.
What's a Timedium? She's a medium, but she can also travel through time and she solves crimes.
That's so stupid.
She time-travels and she's a medium? But the one crime she can't solve is her husband's murder.
So my name is Hollyhock and I love apples but hate applesauce, too slimy.
I was the captain of the JV soccer team BoJack, why did you bring this child into my sanctum? I can make this real quick.
Did you give up my secret baby in the year 2000? Oh, BoJack, do you recall the impetus for our uncoupling? Is every one of these gonna be a whole thing? You were a cad and a boor.
But your fits of sardonic japery amused, to a point, until you impregnated me.
What? Suddenly, I was awash in dreams of idealized domesticity.
But when I told you I was with child, I received a check in the mail for $200 with the memo line, "BoJack's half of the abortion.
" So you put me up for adoption? Child, no.
I had the abortion.
Nice.
You don't want any little BoJacks floating around.
Last thing this world needs is more of this garbage.
Uh, excuse me? No, you're great, you seem cool, but if we could go back in time and prevent it Right? Hollyhock, I didn't mean By the way, your show sucks.
Should be called "Tedium.
" Your uterus contains the secrets of life, the ability to create.
Go, go! Oh, God! I'm going! At this point, your ovum has burst out of the swollen follicle, traveled down the long gentle river of the fallopian tube, and been welcomed by the warm embrace of the silk-lined uterus.
No, no, no.
You must fertilize that precious ovum now or it will disintegrate into nothingness.
Hit the gas! Do it for Philbert! Pull over your vehicle, now! Oh, fish! So in conclusion, I don't think California is the greatest state in the country.
But it can be.
Beautifully put.
I'd like to drill down, as it were, on the subject of fracking.
Drill away.
Now, mere hours ago your wife, Diane Nguyen, seen here eating a messy sandwich, published an essay online titled "The Case Against Fracking" in which she posits, quote "If these frack-happy politicians "even knew how dangerous it was, "they wouldn't allow it in their own backyards.
" Diane wrote that? Damn.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, your wife has issued a challenge.
Would you allow fracking in your own backyard? I would.
Joining us now via Periscope is Frankie Flackery, foreman and spokesyak for Flackery Will Get You Everywhere industrial drilling company.
How are ya? Flackery Flack, let's talk frack.
Mr.
Peanutbutter has invited you to drill on his property.
Uh Will you take him up on this invitation? I could have a team there this afternoon.
Oh Ready when you are, boys! Sir, I apologize.
We are very eager to get home.
You were going 36 miles per hour.
The speed limit here Is 35.
Yes.
Now, I'm no mathematician.
I'm just a humble officer of the law.
Okay.
So you tell me, is 36 below 35 or is it above 35? Just write us a ticket and let us go.
Now, now, talking back to Officer Meow Meow is a major no-no.
Hello! Harvey Fierstein here.
Oh! Who said that? Is there another man in your vehicle? Hello? Show yourself, fiend! We don't have time for this! I'm in heat! Ma'am, you need to calm down! Don't tell me to calm down or call me ma'am! Just write us a goddamn ticket so I can go home and mount my boyfriend! That's enough! Out of the car, all three of you! Obviously, I didn't mean you.
You're giving me the silent treatment? I guess I have thin skin.
Must be the half of me that's made of garbage.
Well, who else is on this list? Stacy, Fabiana Tonya Harding? She is not gonna be happy to see me.
She said sleeping with me is the worst thing she ever did.
I'm sorry it's so unpleasant for you to have to interact with women you were shitty to.
I don't understand why we're even doing this.
You're never gonna switch bodies with your mom.
God! That ship has sailed and is also impossible.
Pull over the car.
No.
Pull over now! Jesus.
Fine.
I'm gonna do the rest of this on my own.
No.
Hollyhock.
I got the list.
I don't need you anymore.
Have a bad life.
Joke's on you, I already have one! Oh no.
No.
No, no.
Where's Mr.
Peanutbutter? He's giving a stump speech on the subject of stumps.
Turns out he's pro.
Great for sitting.
I'd be careful with that faucet, the water comes out very hot because of the fracking.
Aaah! How could you let him do this? You're the one who called his bluff.
Don't do that.
This just makes my job harder.
I didn't "call his bluff.
" I just Woman, you have one job: be his wife, be supportive.
I am being supportive.
Was that you being supportive today with that piece you wrote for your stupid girl website? It's called Girl Croosh.
"Stoopid Gurl" is just a subsection of the main site.
And my piece wasn't about Mr.
Peanutbutter, specifically.
I'm gonna cut this conversation short, because my time is more important than yours.
This goes one of two ways.
Either you shut up and be pretty, or your approximation of that, or don't support him, he resents you, your marriage implodes.
Pick your poison.
Damn! Not that I get to vote, but from one Mrs.
Peanutbutter to another, it's been really fun for me to watch this new marriage fall apart.
We're not.
So thank you, Diane, for that tiny sliver of mint in the smoothie of dogshit that is trying to get that popular idiot elected.
Good night.
Damn! I'm Harvey Fierstein, and I hope you're almost done having sex because your ovulation cycle will soon be ending.
Huh.
I'm sorry we couldn't get home in time.
Your lawyer, he's good? The best.
Then you know what we have to do? Oh! For Philbert? For Philbert.
What are you doing back there? Hey! Sorry you have to be here for this.
Keep your eyes on the road.
Hey! You two cut that out! I'll write you up for lewd conduct.
Lewd, crude and partially nude! Not to mention the rude 'tude of you two dudes, while this prude Hey, listen to me! Whoa! And so the dance of life continues apace.
I'm Harvey Fierstein, bidding you a sexy good evening.
No! Can I get my check now? Alone, at last.
Thank God.
Fine, fine, fine.
Hi, Fabiana.
Before you slam the door Did a young horse girl come by here, about yay high? You're still mad about your dad's funeral? That was 18 years ago! Thank you, Tonya.
I know we've had our differences, but seeing you always leaves me weak in the knees.
Hollyhock.
Was that her? Ugh! No.
I talked to 23 women today and none of them were my mother.
How did you find me? I went to everyone on that list.
You talked to all those women? Some of them Really haven't aged well, I know.
I was gonna say, really hate you.
Oh, yeah, that too.
But I needed to find you.
To tell you I'm sorry, for being such an asshole then and also now.
This whole thing was stupid.
I never should have come out here.
And I don't even care about having a mom, really.
Because I did fine for 17 years without one.
I don't need a mom.
Hollyhock, it's okay to want a mom.
No, it's not! Because that means my dads weren't enough for me, and they are! I know I just met you, but if you do have any of the old Horseman gunk bouncing around in that brain of yours, I gotta tell you right now you should give up on looking for "enough" because it will never be enough.
Eww! Stop that.
I know, it's stupid.
There, there.
You are so bad at this.
What do your dads say when you cry? They say it's okay to cry, and that I shouldn't feel bad about feeling bad.
Well, that that's good advice, right? They're really good dads.
I should probably get back to them.
Oh.
You don't have to leave right away.
Why don't you just stay with me a bit longer? At least until we find your mom.
How are we supposed to do that? Every name on that list was a dead end.
Oh Yeah.
But what if I told you there's a name that isn't on that list? Someone Marcy never knew about.
What? Where is she now? I don't know.
But you can stay with me while we try to find her? Okay.
Yeah.
What's her name? Her name was Brown Car la.
Carla Mercedes Benz Brown.
"Carla Mercedes Benzbrown"? Weird name.
You've got a weird name.
I guess you're right.
Maybe that's the first thing we'll talk about when I meet her.
Mm-hmm? Diane, I know.
I'm sorry about the trucks, but you didn't give me much choice.
I know these last few days have been crazy.
But this is the hard part.
I need you to drop out of the race.
What? Please, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
This isn't worth it.
I hear what you're saying and I will try to be more conscientious of your needs.
Drop out of the race.
Because your needs are important.
I've written another piece for Girl Croosh.
It's called "The Case Against Mr.
Peanutbutter.
" What? When I hit this button, the post goes live.
Diane, don't.
I don't want to.
And I won't, if you drop out of the race.
Jesus, Diane.
You can't do that.
Because you're the only one allowed to make decisions for this family? No.
Because it's gonna come off as a weird lovers' spat and it's just going to embarrass everyone.
Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.
Oh, come on.
You told me you weren't going to frack, and now I can't turn on a faucet in my own home without getting third-degree burns.
Oh, I get it.
So like always, you're mad at someone, so your solution is to air your dirty laundry for everyone to see.
No.
This is not about us.
I don't want you to be governor because you would be bad at it, because you don't stand for anything.
No! Hey! Don't you dare.
Robert Blake gave me that mug.
No! Oh, you I don't Shut up.
Take off your shirt.
Frack me, Mr.
Peanutbutter! Frack me!
Oh, no.
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, but there was another mass shooting.
Oh, God, where? A town outside Tampa called Not geographically, dipshit.
What's the location? What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery? It was a shopping mall.
No! Ms.
Taken is coming out next month.
I know, sir.
The whole third act revolves around Courtney Portnoy shooting people in a mall.
What are we supposed to do now, not release the movie? I hope it doesn't come to that.
I am sick and tired of real-life gun violence getting in the way of us telling stories that glamorize gun violence.
Why does this keep happening? Has the whole world gone crazy? No, we've just been conditioned by a rugged individualist culture woven into the savage architecture of our country itself, birthed as it was through violent uprising, but perhaps popularized in the modern imagination by stories of Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk, I'll staple a string to your back and then yank it.
Why not make yourself useful and schedule a sit-down with Courtney Portnoy's team to talk about how we distance ourselves from this fakakte mishegoss.
Got it.
Except for the foccacia Michigan part.
Excuse me, could you point me in the direction of an H&M? Sure.
But when you get there, you're gonna be DOA.
Uh-uh.
You picked the wrong shopaholic to mess with.
Because this shopaholic's also a holic for revenge.
[GUNFIRE.]
Die, scum! [LAUGHING.]
Courtney Portnoy-vey.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING.]
Wow.
Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.
Yep.
My mother.
That's right.
[CLEARS THROAT.]
I lied! What? There's no Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.
I have no idea who your mother is.
What? I don't want to have a relationship lying to each other.
Okay, so why did you lie to me? I meant everything else I said.
I'll do everything I can to help find your mom.
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.
In fact, in my experience, they're soulless succubi born fully formed from the ass of Satan.
Oh, my grandmother sounds like quite a character.
Can I meet her? Oh, my mom? No, you cannot meet my mom because she's dead.
Oh.
Dead mom.
BoJack, what happened to the fudgesicles I bought? I lied again.
My mom's not dead.
Stop lying to me! That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.
Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.
I do.
Where does she live? Oh, this spectacular elder care facility, she has her own private room with a nice view, 'round-the-clock medical care, and plenty of other seniors to say casually cruel things to under a passive-aggressive veil of plausible deniability.
What's this place called? I want to say Whispering Pines.
Whistling Pines? Unbelievable.
Something with a W.
Winter's Bone? Take me there.
[GROANS.]
Fine! For real this time? Yes.
I promise.
I am not gonna lie to you ever again.
Did you eat the last fudgesicle? No.
I lied.
I lied about the fudgesicle.
[GUN COCKS.]
All this time you thought I was just another damsel in distress, but I'm afraid you were mis guided.
[GUN COCKS.]
[GUNFIRE.]
[SCREAMING.]
Oh oh.
[GROANS.]
That is not good.
Okay.
Everybody set a Google Alert for "mass shooting.
" Can't keep getting caught off guard.
This is so sad.
You always hear about mass shootings affecting other people's movie openings, but you never think they're gonna affect your movie opening.
[SOBS.]
My thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families.
Of course.
Yeah, thoughts and prayers.
Thoughts and prayers.
Tragedy like this really puts things in perspective.
Like, what are we doing sitting in a conference room? Life is short.
We should have this meeting at a water park.
Whoa! A water park where people have meetings.
Maybe that's the movie.
I'm sorry, who is this schmuck? I'm Courtney's asexual fake fiancÃ©.
He's a common person/supermodel, being engaged to him makes me appear more approachable/glamorous.
Okay-slash-whatever.
We still have time to cut the mall shootout from the film.
That still leaves the movie theater shootout, the shootout at the county fair, the [VIBRATIONS AND BUZZING.]
We should probably lose the movie theater shootout.
Right.
Well, we still have the county fair shootout.
[VIBRATIONS AND BUZZING.]
Oh, dear.
This is a sad day.
What? I gotta take this.
BoJack? Hi.
Where have you been? Listen.
I'm sorry.
I was an awful boyfriend to you.
I was an awful client, and I was an awful friend.
This last year I spent some time away and it made me realize how special the people in my life are.
And you might be the most special of them all.
Wow, BoJack.
[CHUCKLES.]
I I appreciate that.
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is, do you remember the name of that super nice elder care facility that we both agreed was the best place for my mom to run out the clock? Oh, pluck a duck.
It's called Walnut Springs.
Walnut Springs! I knew there was a W in there.
Bye! [SIGHS.]
[RINGING.]
What? I feel like I didn't strike the right tone in the last phone call.
I really am sorry, and the most important thing is, you know how dedicated I am to making things right again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is, turns out there's a few Walnut Springses in the SoCal area.
It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy! Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died? A lotta people! [PANTING.]
Sorry, what did I miss? Courtney's beloved was outlining his plan to curtail gun violence.
I'm just saying, if people have the right pumped-up kicks, maybe they can outrun the bullets.
All this talk of gun violence is depressing.
Ms.
Taken is a movie about empowerment.
That's what I've been saying! It's Bridget Jones with slightly more bloody murdering.
We just have to keep the story on Courtney, and not on the depressingly unstoppable rise of real-life gun violence in this country, thoughts and prayers.
Thoughts and prayers.
Thoughts and prayers.
[ALL THINGS CONSIDERED THEME PLAYING.]
Oh.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING.]
[ROBERT SIEGEL.]
The House Majority Whip outlined a new bipartisan plan to encourage you to answer your ringing phone.
[AUDIE CORNISH.]
For Thursday, October 12, this is All Rings Considered.
I'm Robert Siegel.
And I'm Audie Cornish.
The proposed bill would take effect when someone tries to call you and you hear this ringtone.
[VIBRATING.]
Hello? Diane! I got an exclusive for you.
You are going to write a glowing feature about my client and her new movie.
Why would I You know Courtney Portnoy.
You probably recall when she soared as the thorny horticulturist in One Sordid Fortnight With the Short-Skirted Sorceress.
Uh How would you enjoy joining Portnoy for a scorched soy porterhouse pork four-courser at Koi? Wait, what? Glorify your source, but don't make it feel forced, of course, and try the borscht.
Smooches! Hey And that's how you do it, folks.
Oh [GASPS.]
You're telling me you didn't feel one twinge of guilt when you left your mom in this place? Uh twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt, trying to remember, no.
Definitely not.
Damn.
You didn't know my mom.
Football? You don't have the haunches for it.
You'll only embarrass yourself, as in every other endeavor you pursue.
But, Mom If you're looking to get knocked around for an afternoon, why don't you just read one of your father's manuscripts and tell him his prose is pedestrian and derivative? Works for me every time.
[INHALES AND PUFFS.]
Mrs.
Horseman, you have a visitor.
Oh, uh Hi, Mom.
Do I know you? Here we go.
Yes, Mom, I never visit.
You got me.
Henrietta? Okay, we're doing this? I think she really doesn't know who you are.
She knows.
This is just like when she pretended not to recognize me after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.
I had to get a ride home with the pianist who liked to tickle a lot more than just the ivories.
When I made it home unscathed, she said, "Huh.
I guess no one wants you.
" Henrietta, could I trouble you for some orange juice, please? Stop calling me Henrietta! Nobody here's named Henrietta! Henrietta, orange juice.
Now! You're not being paid for polite conversation.
BoJack, maybe you should just Oh, hello! It's you.
Hollyhock.
I must apologize for Henrietta.
She learned to read on secondhand books.
Mom, do you really not know who I am? Me, famous BoJack? If you are getting orange juice, I'd love a glass too.
Oh.
Uh, okay.
So you see I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.
Yeah, you put your pants on one leg at a time.
Well, I step into my pants one leg at a time, then my trouser-maidens lift the legs simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.
Well, right, of course, why else have trouser-maidens? Hey.
Konichiwa, Princess Mulan.
Just leave us alone, okay? I was giving you a compliment.
First, konichiwa is not a compliment, it's Japanese for hello.
Second, I'm not Japanese.
Maybe I could put something in that sweet mouth of yours so you don't have to talk so much.
Whoa! One more step, asshole.
What Whoa, whoa, whoa! I was joking.
I don't want any trouble.
Tell your story walking.
the shit was that? I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.
Why do you even have a gun? Well, using it in the movie was so empowering, and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it? No, I am very anti-gun.
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns is inherently Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.
How long has this been in my hand? Slides right in, doesn't it? It actually feels kind of nice.
Would you like to try shooting it? We can go to my gun range.
You have your own gun range? I'm Courtney Portnoy.
I have all the things.
[CLICKING.]
[BREATHLESS GASP.]
Whoa [BEA.]
I can't believe you came back.
Who, me? Or BoJack? You look just like him.
People tell me that.
[GROANS.]
Your mother's dementia is progressing rapidly.
You came out of nowhere.
Yes.
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol for the alarming creep of dementia.
It isn't there, until it is.
Thank you, very colorful.
We tried to call you, but the number you gave us connected to a sandwich shop in Temecula.
Is that right? This is the most responsive she's been in weeks.
I think with regular visits from you and your daughter That's not happening.
Seeing my mom is like a Terrence Malick movie.
Every ten years or so is bearable, but more than that and it starts to get annoying.
She won't last another ten years.
Well, I guess that's it, then.
Bye, Mom! Huh? Come on, Hollyhock, let's blow this Jell-O stand.
We're gonna come back though, right? We can't just leave her like this.
You can do anything if you believe in yourself.
We have to come back.
[BEA.]
Henrietta? Every week.
Why? Because she's your mother and dementia is hereditary.
One day, you're gonna be in a home like this, and so will I, and wouldn't you want someone visiting you? [GROANS.]
Fine.
We'll come back.
Happy? Where's my orange juice, slag? [GULPING.]
Ahhh! [GULPING.]
Ahhh! See ya next week.
[HUMMING.]
Hey, are we out of milk? I can pick up some after work.
Great.
Also, real quick follow-up, why are you holding a gun? Oh, my God! Did I drive all the way home without realizing I was holding a gun? No wonder that guy at the gas station didn't charge me for the Red Vines.
[GASPS.]
Did I rob a gas station? Classic Diane shenanigans.
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans.
" All right, be safe.
[SMOOCHES.]
[SIGHS.]
Hmm.
[DIANE.]
Let's get one thing out of the way right now.
If you're a man, you're not gonna get it.
Some of you think you get it.
You want to get it.
You listen, nod and say all the right things when we tell you our stories.
But you still can't actually know what it feels like to constantly have your guard up.
[WOLF WHISTLE.]
In parking garages, walking the street, even at work.
I'm tired of trying to help men understand how it feels to be a woman.
Starting now, I'm doing what it takes to put the power in my own hands.
That's why I own a gun.
That was our senior picnic.
Oh.
Oh, here I am.
There's Polio Larry.
Yup, she sure remembers all the important people.
[HOLLYHOCK.]
And who's this? [BEA.]
That's my brother, Crackerjack.
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.
Thirty seconds after that picture was taken you yelled at me for getting ice cream on my shorts.
No ice cream for me, Henrietta.
I'm watching my figure.
Yeah, you want to look pretty for when Death comes to visit.
Beth? No.
We stopped talking after she wouldn't eat my casserole and then I told the whole supper club that her son was a gay.
Ooh.
Okay.
You two enjoy each other.
I'm gonna go see if I can seduce a lonely dowager into giving me her night-night pills.
Wow.
Is this you? [BEA.]
This is me at my debutante ball.
You were so beautiful.
You could be thin, too.
Just go easy on the sweets and when you go somewhere, don't walk, gallop.
Ice cold, Grammy-gram.
[BOTH.]
Morning time, Hollywoo! I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
And I'm A Billy Bush Type.
Here's something I'm just now reading on a cue card.
All the ladies are getting concealed carry permits.
It's the newest thing.
I wouldn't want to be around one of those ladies at a certain time of the month, if you know what I mean.
[LAUGHS.]
I don't.
Joking aside, I think it's great these gals have a hobby.
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers that we have a breaking news alert There has been another mass shooting.
[GROANS.]
I am totally unqualified to cover a news story this important.
But as a straight white male, I will plow forward with confidence and assume I'm doing fine.
[GROANS.]
Again with the crazy gunmen.
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up, we're gonna have to put this movie on the shelf next to that wacky vacation comedy we did about the klutzy babysitter.
[TODD.]
Ha! That sounds hilarious! What the hell are you doing on this call? Imagining that funny movie you just described.
Okay, what do all these shootings have in common? Guns? Bullets? Who are you, Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.
Men! What if we played up the "Ms.
" in Ms.
Taken? In a world of increasing terror, our movie tells women they don't have to be afraid anymore.
Yeah, now you're talking.
When you put it that way, it almost sounds like these mass shootings could be a good thing for the movie.
No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.
Thoughts and prayers are with the victims.
Right, thoughts and prayers.
But anything that makes women feel unsafe might actually help our box office.
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.
Of course not! Nobody wants that, nobody's saying that.
But if they already do feel unsafe, there's no reason not to capitalize.
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.
Exactly, we're not making them feel unsafe.
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly, from there being more mass shootings.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATES.]
In that case, I got good news and I got bad news.
Bad news is you're gonna want to avoid the 405.
Ta-da! Ugh! Keep it down.
Why are you carrying that thin hard book? It's not a book, it's a DVD case.
We did a special episode about elder care.
Now we're gonna watch it and learn how to handle this bitch.
When you say "this bitch", do you mean your mom's dementia or your mom? I think you can pick that up through context.
Season two, episode 12.
"I'm Ready For My Close-Up, Mr.
Dementia.
" I'll go lie down.
[MUSIC PLAYS.]
Hey, Ethan, who's your friend? [OLIVIA.]
Ethan made a friend? This old man followed me home from the park.
Can I keep him? [AUDIENCE.]
Aww.
[THE HORSE.]
Here we go, again.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE.]
BoJack? Mom? Hush, Henrietta.
That's my son on the television.
You know him? I think I'd know my own son, wouldn't I? [ETHAN.]
You heard the boss man.
Guess your daughter, the bikini model, will have to pick you up at the park.
Daughter, the bikini model? Whoa, whoa, Ethan, this man is our guest! [LAUGHS.]
Uh Huh.
[CLEARS THROAT.]
You know I hate guns, right? I know.
Although my official stated political opinion is I respect the Second Amendment but I think some gun purchases should require the barest amount of background checks.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you know I hate guns, too.
Or I thought I did.
Or I still do, mostly.
But being a gun owner finally makes me feel as safe walking down the street as a man gets to feel all the time.
And that's an incredible feeling I'm not ready to give up yet.
If you can frack under our house, I should get to have a gun.
All right, that's fair.
I'm really proud we've found a way to keep our personal lives and our political lives compartmentalized.
Me, too.
You have no idea Yes.
I have no idea? Is your bubble of privilege so thick, What's with humans and guns? You're addicted to these things.
And what is it with men and not wanting women to feel safe? I don't This is a gendered issue Excuse me! make no mistake.
I don't think women You can't sympathize running around with guns makes anybody safer.
Yeah.
That's the danger.
I don't Excuse me.
Not the men who commit 90 percent of murders, it's the crazy hysterical women you gotta worry about! [GRUNTING AND MOANING.]
[DIANE.]
Yes, yes! Fill my chamber with your powerful bullets! Beatrice, look who's back.
And we brought more Horsin' Around.
Oh? Good.
Because you love that BoJack, right? Well, he's not much of a son, but the show can be a comfort sometimes.
[EXHALES.]
They were playing your dumb show in his hospital room.
Which dumb show? New one or old one? In the episode I saw, you walked in on your daughter in the shower.
The old one.
That episode got us into the TV Guide "Cheers and Jeers" column.
We did not get a "Cheers.
" You always could play the fool, BoJack.
We have to have this conversation now, on the way to Dad's funeral? [SIGHS.]
There was so much more I wanted to say to him.
Well you can forget it now.
[LAUGHS.]
[OLIVIA.]
And since you saw me naked, that means I get to see you naked! [THE HORSE.]
Something tells me I'm gonna regret this.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING.]
[GROANS.]
Out of the way, hag, you're blocking the screen.
Uh-huh.
I know this must be painful for you.
Not painful, boring.
This place sucks.
If I'm not getting credit for coming, what's the point? If only there was some way for her to connect the BoJack from the show with the BoJack who visits her every week.
Yeah, too bad we can't.
Or can we? Can we what? Put on a live episode of Horsin' Around in the nursing home.
Good thinking, Hollyhock.
Uh We'll do a Horsin' Around here at the home.
She'll love it because it's her son BoJack.
Okay Then after the show, I'll come out and say hello.
And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?" When her eyes spark with recognition, I'm gonna sit down next to her, I'm gonna squeeze her hand and get real close and say "Fuck you, Mom.
" What? I can finally tell her off! I'm gonna say, "Look at you", you old piece of shit, rotting in a nursing home!" Now I have the power! That's what you want to say to her? Oh, it's gonna be great! I can't wait to see the look on her face.
Okay, let's do this.
Let's put on a show! [RINGING.]
Hey! Bad news.
Hear about the mass shooting outside Tulsa? Terrible tragedy.
Thoughts and prayers.
We really have to do something about these men who go No, P.
C.
This time it was a woman.
A woman mass shooter? Oh, no, that really is bad news! I just think this is what happens when you give women guns.
They start shooting people with them.
I mean, do they even know what guns are for? I don't feel safe anymore walking down my own street alone at night.
Me, a man! I am convening a series of congressional hearings on the matter of women and guns.
Because even one death from the bullet of a female gun owner is too many.
What are my constituents supposed to do, not compliment random women on the street because they might be carrying a gun? We cannot allow our lives to be dictated by that kind of fear.
So you see, the trigger was specifically designed for a man's grip and a man's temperament.
Look, all I'm saying is maybe you shouldn't blame women for wanting guns.
Maybe you should blame the constant societal messaging that tells us we are safe only as long as the men around us allow us to be.
So if you have a problem with women carrying firearms, you can roll up your sleeves and actually work to create a society where women feel safe and equal, or you can just ban all guns.
[GAVEL BANGING.]
The ayes have it.
Possession of any firearm is now illegal in the state of California.
We did it, boys.
Huzzah! Yes! Congratulations! Fabulous! I thought that was gonna go the other way.
Wow, Diane.
You just passed sensible gun legislation.
I can't believe this country hates women more than it loves guns.
No? BoJack, I don't know about this.
You'll be fine.
Just remember to enunciate.
It helps if you imagine performing for the back row.
Not that.
I mean Shh! Here they come.
Gladys, hit it! [PLAYS HORSIN' AROUND THEME.]
Too bad I could never run for president, 'cause I love waffling! Wha What is this? Olivia, you usually love my breakfast humor.
Why so glum, sugarplum? It's this algebra homework that gives me the blues.
X-axis? Y-axis? [PANTING AND GASPING.]
Where's the 'Y'-should-I-care axis? Henrietta, what are you doing? BoJack, maybe we should stop.
We just started.
Let's at least get through the first act before we judge ourselves too harshly, huh? I wonder if there's a way to make math fun.
[HOLLYHOCK.]
Math will never be fun.
[CLICKING.]
The only thing I like, is rap music songs.
[GROANING AND PANTING.]
Make this stop.
How do I turn this off? Don't change it.
I want to see if this married couple can work through their differences.
Gimme the remote! This isn't right! Guys, sharing is caring! [GRUNTS.]
Oh, my God.
Code red, code red! What is happening? I don't like this! No! [BEA.]
Let go of me.
Oh, God.
I am the heiress to the Sugarman Sugarcube Company.
You can't do this to me! [SCREAMING.]
I never get to watch what I want.
You think we should still finish the episode, or? Our insurance policy is very strict and very clear.
Once a resident becomes violent, we can no longer house them.
Can you recommend another facility? Frankly, at your mother's rate of deterioration, she probably doesn't have much time.
I recommend she spend it surrounded by the people who care about her.
Okay, who are they? Do you have their number? I was referring to you and your daughter.
Oh.
Uh We'll take her.
She can have the guest room, and I can sleep on the couch.
Right? [GROANS.]
Okay.
If she really doesn't have much time left.
But if we get to this time next year, she's still hanging on, you will be getting a very strongly worded letter, mister.
Excuse me, could you point me in the direction of an H&M? Sure.
[CLICK.]
That's all we got, once we took out all the guns.
Maybe it could work as an H&M commercial? It's a shame.
It was a great movie.
[SIGHS.]
Yeah.
Cut down in the prime of its life.
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.
Eh, I'll be fine.
Hey, Beatrice, you hungry? I could make Pop-Tarts.
[BEA.]
No, thank you.
You want to watch another Horsin' Around episode? What's the point? Oh.
[GROWLS.]
Oh, God.
I'm sorry you didn't get to tell your mom off.
I keep thinking about all the things I never said because I was so sure there'd be other days to say them.
Why don't you tell her now? It's not the same.
I should have done it back when she knew who I was, back when it would mean something.
But now, she's gonna die and she's never gonna know just how much I hate her.
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.
Yeah? You're not just saying that? She read your book, didn't she? [SIGHS.]
Yeah, but I really wanted to say it to her face.
Well, hey, she's here now, right? And she has good days and bad days.
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.
You really think so? Mm-hmm.
[CHUCKLES.]
Piece of shit.
Stupid piece of shit.
You're a real stupid piece of shit.
But I know I'm a piece of shit.
That makes me better than all the pieces of shit who don't know they're pieces of shit.
Or is it worse? Breakfast.
Oh, I don't deserve breakfast.
Shut up.
Don't feel sorry for yourself.
Get breakfast, you stupid fat-ass.
These are cookies.
This is not breakfast.
You are eating cookies.
Stop it.
Stop eating cookies, go make yourself breakfast.
Stop it.
Don't eat one more cookie.
Put that down.
Do not eat that cookie.
I can't believe you ate that cookie.
Hey, BoJack, we need milk.
For the baby.
For the what? Where is the baby? I saw Can I borrow your car? What baby? I don't know.
Tina's gonna make breakfast.
She needs milk.
Can I take the car or what? Shit.
I don't want her driving my car, getting her grubby hands all over.
She's not grubby, she's your daughter, you piece of garbage.
You're a piece of garbage, a real shitty piece of garbage.
Uh Think, idiot.
If she takes the car, you're trapped here with Mom and her spooky lazy eyes.
If you get the milk and leave Hollyhock with Mom, she could tell things about you, poison your daughter against you, that what you want? Okay, how about, um Hold on.
They're looking.
Say something! Open your idiot dumb mouth! I will get milk.
Milk, milk.
What are they talking about now? Probably you and what a dumb piece of trash you are, you fat sack of idiot.
Why not do the world a favor and swerve into oncoming traffic? No, you don't deserve to die young, only the greats die young.
Oh, now you think you're young all of a sudden? One drink.
Whoa.
Is it night suddenly? Suddenly sundown.
Suddenly "Sooze-town.
" What was that show? "Suddenly Sooze-town?" Brooke Shields something? Show was on for five years and now nobody Oh, my God, is that life? You're there, you do your thing, and then people forget.
"Forget it, Jake.
It's Sooze-town.
" Is that me? Am I the Suddenly Sooze-town of people? Shit.
Oh, shit.
You gotta drive.
Sober up, buddy.
Here we go, sober now! Sober, now! Come on, you drunk piece of shit, be less drunk.
Now! Okay.
Idiot.
What'd you do all day? Piece of shit.
That's a day you'll never get back.
What was that? You're a real piece of Where have you been? Uh Did you get the milk? Uh Stupid piece of shit.
Oh, God.
If you're looking for the milk Tina ended up getting, Tina is using it to make us all breakfast.
Well, it's about time someone pulls their weight around here.
Henrietta, you should make a healthy breakfast.
Okay, that's enough from you.
For the baby.
No one loves a Fatty Patty.
Uh-oh.
Is my house on a slant or something? This wall needs to be painted.
I'm gonna go.
You don't want to stick around, eat breakfast together? Great pitch, love your energy.
It's a pass.
What are you doing? Go home.
You're parked on Mulholland doing nothing, you could be eating breakfast with your long-lost daughter and dying mother.
You are a terrible person.
Use the shoulder, asshole! He gets it.
I know, I wanted to tell you right away.
Right this way.
Oh, I gotta go.
See you tonight.
If it isn't my favorite client, Courtney Portnoy, and also another client, Todd.
It's always nice to be included in a sentence someone says.
Ms.
Taken was a miserable failure.
Princess Carolyn But Courtney, more importantly, audiences are going to adore your tour de force performance as the forceful denim-clad court reporter in The Court Reporter Sported Jorts, the jet-setting jort-sporting court reporter story.
Yes, the film is spectacularly romantic and well-titled, but I need a change in representation.
No! Courtney! Before you fire me I'm not gonna fire you.
Heavens, no! I fired my agents.
Oh, good.
Yeah, agents are replaceable.
A manager is forever.
That's the takeaway here.
I think you'll fall in love with my new agent.
Love her already.
Who is she? He.
Yes, he, he, ha, ha.
Now tell me her name.
Rutabaga Rabitowitz.
Oh, fish.
We got a nice bounce off of Court's engagement.
"Court" is what I'm calling Courtney for wordplay-related reasons that'll become apparent at the end of this sentence, but that bounce has lost its pounce, and if we want to keep this name in the news, we're going to need a full-court press.
So what do you do after an engagement? D-d-d-doy! Wedding of the century.
Whoa! We're talking floral arrangements.
We're talking procession of elephants.
We're talking Jaden Smith in a Clockwork Orange costume, reading a poem he wrote Does that poem rhyme? No! What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.
And, uh-oh, was someone looking for Sebastian Janikowski, because here's the kicker We do the whole thing the weekend before the movie drops.
Bam! Weekend before the movie drops? Boom! That's this weekend.
Ka-zow! Four days from today.
Ooh.
Today? That's today! Which is why it's so perfect.
No notice is the new notice.
This wedding is so fancy we don't care if you have other plans.
Total status move.
You're right.
Being engaged is one thing, but I'm not sure I want to actually get married.
We can draw up a standard Hollywoo sham-marriage contract: Three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.
Oh.
And I presume you'll be arranging everything.
As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help, but I believe traditionally it's the bride's manager who plans the wedding.
Okay.
Idiot.
Stupid animal.
Oaf.
You are just the prettiest thing.
Yes, you are.
Who are you talking to? Keep it down, oaf.
You'll make the baby cry.
Baby? Yes, you are.
She kept asking where the baby was, so I had Tina get her this doll.
She's totes into it.
Mom is "totes" into a baby? Is it possible the baby got dipped in brandy at some point? Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas about immigrants? I think she just wanted a baby.
Coochie-coochie-coo You shouldn't indulge her delusions.
It's not right.
But she seemed really down.
And you're never around anymore.
It was getting depressing to look at her.
That's why I made her this pillowcase.
You just put this over her head and everything is fine.
Dark in here.
Hello? So they're airing an F.
H.
B.
A.
Miami marathon this weekend.
Does anyone want to come over? Oh, I actually have a big announcement.
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy this weekend.
Wow! Great, Todd.
Good for you.
That's amazing.
I know it's pretty wild for an asexual to get married, but Not really.
John and I are aces and we're married.
Really? Yeah.
Our wedding was nautical-themed.
Why nautical? Is that, like, an asexual thing? No, man.
We just really like boats.
Asexual just means you're not interested in sex.
Some asexuals are also a-romantic, but others have relationships like anyone else.
But involving boats? I feel like you're getting really hung up on the boats thing.
So, it's not weird for an ace to get married? No, if you found someone who really accepts you for who you are, go for it.
I will! I mean, I am.
I mean, am I? Mmm! Beatrice, this coffee is amazing.
You stupid garbage fire.
Everything sucks.
BoJack, did you see what your mother is doing? Isn't it incredible? Yeah, making breakfast at three in the afternoon.
So with it.
Isn't this baby well-behaved? Hardly ever cries.
Probably because you're such a good mother, Beatrice.
Don't say that.
I was very nervous to have a baby in the house, but it turns out, all it needed is a mother's love.
Oh, when you grow up, you can be anything you want to be.
Lousy baby.
What did it ever do that was so great? Am I jealous of a doll? Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug, looking at me with its creepy doll eyes She's tricking you, Hollyhock.
This is not what she's really like.
Who cares? Whatever beef you have with your mom, that's just a sweet confused old lady.
She's right.
Wrong.
She's in there.
She knows exactly what she's doing.
You are so paranoid.
Please stop fighting.
All this shouting is bad for the baby.
Where was that keen parenting insight 50 years ago? Henrietta, you're unfit to be a parent.
I'm unfit? It's true, jackass.
You think it's so hard to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.
Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.
Hope I don't drop it! Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.
Guess it's okay.
I'm an amazing parent.
What if I left it in its room all day and didn't feed it or change it? Oh, that's okay, too.
I must be mother of the year! BoJack.
I know! What if for 18 years straight I just tell it how worthless it is every day, how it embarrasses me, how my life would be better if it was never born? Would that be a good idea? Probably, right? Give me the baby back, you worthless waste of my husband's jism! Oh, so you do know who I am.
Govern yourself, Henrietta.
Hey, you think the baby would be okay if I threw it over the side of my deck? Probably, right? BoJack, don't.
Do it.
Nah, I'm just kidding around.
Here you go, Mom.
Oh, no! My hands are so slippery! Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh! No! Nice arm.
Why did you do that? You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.
This is what you do.
This is what you always do.
This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.
She's right.
Doll never hurt anybody.
Doll wouldn't throw you over the side of a mountain.
Gotta make things right.
Gotta get Doll back.
Okay, one drink.
And then, Doll back.
You screw-up.
You're making your daughter hate you.
Which is good, because look what happens when people love you.
Look at Penny.
And Herb.
And Sarah Lynn.
It's because you made them love you, BoJack.
You gotta fix this, dummy.
How can you fix this? Princess Carolyn? She hates your guts.
Todd? No.
Diane? Yes! Oh, good.
Good old responsible Diane, she'll know what to do.
Oh aah Oh.
"California can't wait.
" Am I Ace of Base right now? Because all that I want is another one of these babies.
BoJack Horseman? What is this, a will.
i.
am-style celebrity endorsement video? Where's Diane? Oh, she's on the roof.
Boy, will she be surprised to see you.
Diane! What are you doing? No, not like this.
She doesn't know I'm here.
First time she sees me can't be drunk asking for help.
What's wrong? You need help? Idiot.
You gotta get me outta here.
Where did I park? Um Beep.
Beep, beep? You shouldn't be driving right now.
Why don't I make like Eddie Money and take you home tonight? No, I can't go home.
Not without Doll.
Also, Eddie Money doesn't do the taking home in "Take Me Home Tonight," so if you're taking me home, then I would be Eddie Money.
Okay, something's going on with you.
It's not like you to be so testy.
Yes, it is.
Everyone, take the rest of the day off.
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.
California can wait! Elton, you have to play this wedding.
We want one of those Stranger Things kids to be the ring-bearer.
They're still little? You're gonna do a duet with a hologram of Nat King Cole.
Or, if that's cost-prohibitive, Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.
Puberty? Can we give them something for that? Great.
Fabulous.
We are killing this.
We are doing to this wedding what Rob Durst did to that lady and what Fred Durst did to his career.
I have terrible news.
It's Meryl Streep.
Did Meryl Streep die? No, she's retiring.
Mr.
McGregor! You cannot just walk into a room and say, "I have terrible news about Meryl Streep.
" Her retirement party is scheduled for this Saturday.
All of Hollywoo will be attending.
This Saturday? No, no, no! How is #TortneyChortnoy supposed to compete with that? We're toast.
Unless, uh, we could somehow get Meryl to postpone her party? Hmm what if we put together a project so enticing she couldn't help but climb aboard? One more gig Means no more retirement.
But what could we possibly offer her that she hasn't already done? Ah.
What does every actor want to do? Direct.
Direct! Yeah.
But the dream of any director is to work with Meryl Streep.
You think Meryl wants to direct a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep? Hah! What a nightmare! Okay, all right.
Okay, fine.
But, okay, okay, and this What if all the actors in the movie were Meryl Streep? What? No! Are you suggesting some sort of.
The Klumps type situation where Meryl Streep plays every role? Bingo-bongo, weirdo-beardo.
All the greats have done it.
Peter Sellers, Sir Alec Guinness, Flo from the Progressive ads.
Let's take this to the Streep.
Hey, look.
Maybe this is a baby? Mmm.
Welcome Hey, hey! to the nightmare, non-sexy version of Three's Company that my life has become.
Oh, good.
Instead of getting the doll back, like you said you would, you disappeared for a few hours and found a friend.
For your information, we are on the case.
Just need a whiff of your mom to track the scent.
Uh, excuse me, young lady, I'm looking for a Beatrice, but you're way too young and attractive to be that mean old crone.
What? What are you doing? Okay, I'm picking up on some fruity overtones.
Oak, desert sage No, I'm just kidding around.
It's smelling humor.
Is this the best time to be workshopping your tight five? Okay, got it.
Ooh, this way? No! No, no.
That way! Out the door! Come on! Here we go! Look at him.
Not a care in the world.
How does he do it? This is the place.
Oh, hi, I'm BoJack Horseman.
Felicity Huffman? Looking for this? Yes! Well, keep looking, buddy! You're a real piece of shit, you know that? Yes.
So, instead of talking through your issues, your new thing is to just get in really big fights and then have hot angry sex? Yeah, but it kind of works.
Does it? I'm sorry, I feel like we always talk about me.
What's going on with you, Roxie? I'm actually glad you asked, I Okay.
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice on something? Yeah, of course.
I'm not doing anything.
Um So, I have this friend, and his name is Darnarius McQuimberton.
Oh, yeah, I think I read an article about him in Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.
Darnarius is supposed to get married this weekend.
And it's going to be an amazing wedding, but it's kind of based on a lie.
Should he go through with it? Well, all weddings are lies, right? Sort of.
You're making this big declaration about how you're gonna stay with this person forever, but you don't actually know that.
You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.
Yeah, that's true.
But it's a lie based on truth.
Like, at the center of the farce there's this nugget of something real and pure.
And that strange beautiful something is why you put up with everything else, right? I guess so.
And sometimes it's hard to remember that pure, shining thing because it's been painted over with so many arguments and compromises and disappointments.
But you have to believe it's still down there somewhere, even if you can't see it.
And maybe even the belief in it is more important than the thing itself, but only as long as you still believe it.
Does that make sense? Yeah.
Thanks, Diane.
You've given me and Darquimbertus McNarington a lot to think about.
That was good advice.
I'm, like, a really good friend.
What? Okay.
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.
She's very sick, very frail.
And I know you're really mad at me because Think, shit-for-brains, think.
Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you? You cut her off in traffic, got her fired off a project, talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit and didn't realize your mic was on.
I have been living directly under your house for the last 15 years.
Do you have any idea how much shit you throw over the side of your deck? Beer bottles, lit cigarettes, scripts where the lead is female.
One time, a mountain of regurgitated cotton candy sat on that hill for a month before sliding into my hot tub.
Who you think has to deal with that? I assume your maid or gardener or something? Well, yeah.
But it's still super-obnoxious.
You're not getting that doll back.
Citizens, citizens.
As the future governor of California, I pride myself on probably being able to reach compromises across the ideological spectrum.
Oh! What if we cut the baby in half? What? Why would we do that? No.
So you both agree that's a bad idea.
Perhaps you're not so different after all? Peanutbutter.
How is that? Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star of film and television.
BoJack, you have also appeared in film and television.
What's that like? Discuss.
I'm sorry for my acquaintance.
I'm actually a big fan.
I hope she has no follow-up questions.
Really? So you've probably seen my new show, F.
H.
B.
A.
Los Angeles.
What? Yup, love it.
How'd you like to do an arc for sweeps? Ugh, TV? No.
I just got out of that sinkhole.
He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.
Hup ho hup! What's your status? I have breached Compound Streep.
If I don't make it out of this alive, just know I have already seen heaven and it is Meryl's rose garden.
And the offer? I put it under a big box that's propped up by a stick.
If she goes to look and the box falls on her, she's contractually obligated to do the movie.
Yeah, I know what "packaging talent" means.
Okay, she's walking up to the box.
She's sniffing around, and We got Meryl! All right! Yes! What if I throw myself off my deck into Felicity Huffman's backyard.
If she found my dead body, that'd show her.
Why are we at a bar? We're just celebrating getting Doll back.
You don't want to bring the doll back to your mom? I will.
We're just having a drink first.
Relax.
Okay.
He knows you're terrible.
He's the biggest idiot in the world, even he knows you're terrible.
So when did you get a daughter? She's new, right? Or was she always part of the gang? I met her about a month ago.
Whoa! Yeah.
And it was great, at first.
But now I can feel her getting attached, and I just know I'm gonna BoJack things up.
"BoJack things up?" You mean, show up somewhere and be the life of the party? Then share a laugh with your good friend, Mr.
Peanutbutter? No, obviously I meant screw everything up until she hates me.
I don't think I can take that.
Maybe this time, don't do the thing that makes her hate you.
I don't want to, but every time she looks at me with those big innocent eyes, all I can think about is every shitty thing I've ever done, and I think, "I don't deserve that kind of love.
" Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot about balancing a state budget or how a bill becomes a law.
Uh I don't know a lot about a lot of things.
Everybody deserves to be loved.
So we put together an all-star wedding and a Meryl Streep movie in one day! You got to admit, we're a good team.
Rutabaga I know it wasn't always smooth sailing for the Good Ship You and Me, but now you've got a boyfriend and I've got a family, and since we have to work together again, we're a good team.
Tell me you didn't miss this.
Todd is on line two.
Aaah! Do you go through the walls? Todd! Have you finished your groomsmen list? We gotta figure out how many parachutes we need.
Uh, guys, I I can't marry Courtney.
What? No! I've been doing some thinking, and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.
The lollipop part is a lie, but at the center of the lie there's a truth.
That's the Tootsie Roll, and that's why people get married.
But if I married Courtney it would be a lie without any truth in it, like a Tootsie Pop with just the lollipop part and nothing in the middle.
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.
I guess it's a bad analogy.
But I don't want a fake marriage.
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.
Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.
Thanks, Princess Carolyn.
Whoa All right, blue sky time.
Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow? Courtney got jilted, play the sympathy card? I guess we could put out a statement.
That's your solution? What happened to the guy from this morning with all the big ideas? Oh, that guy dies at six.
This guy's gotta get home.
I got seven kids and a wife who's really into me co-parenting, or, as she calls it, "parenting.
" Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed, read them some script coverage of the film adaptation of Good Night Moon and then come back? This is important.
Well, my kids are important.
Fine, both things are equally important.
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.
You would be hilarious at it.
Hey, today was fun.
I'll call you in the morning.
We'll figure this out.
We'll deal with it.
If you'd like to never see him again, I have ways of getting rid of him.
What kind of ways? Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.
I apologize for misleading you about the number of ways.
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me? I worked with guys like him at F.
M.
E.
When I left, I swore I would never work at a big agency again, because I can't work with people like that.
You don't think I'm like that? No, because you care about people other than yourself.
And for what it's worth, you will be a wonderful mother.
You're not just saying that? I never just say anything.
I choose words very carefully, with an eye towards precision and expediency.
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.
Good night, Judah.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
It's about time, Henrietta.
You're welcome.
Go talk to her, idiot.
Drink first.
No, you stupid alcoholic.
Talk to your daughter.
You're ruining her.
You know that, right? No matter what, your poison is already in her.
There's nothing you can do.
That's not true.
Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.
You're a real stupid piece of shit, and everywhere you go you destroy people.
Your mother never loved you.
That's why Sarah Lynn died, Charlotte'll never forgive you.
What you gonna do to Hollyhock? What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up! Got Doll back.
No big deal.
Where do you go, when you disappear all day? Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.
Sometimes I pull over by the side of the road, just sit there for hours.
Why? And you'd rather do that than spend time with me? Hollyhock I know you didn't ask for this dorky 17-year-old to just show up at your door.
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying, but I didn't ask No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
Oh.
If I'm shitty, that's just because I'm shitty.
You're allowed to be mad at me, but you need to know that whatever I do, it's not your fault.
I know.
I mean, I know, but I don't always know, you know? Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes, like, "Hey, everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!" I know what you mean.
That voice, the one that tells you you're worthless and stupid and ugly? Yeah? It goes away, right? It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl thing, but then it goes away? Yeah.
[DIALS RAPIDLY.]
[LINE RINGING.]
Whew.
BoJack? I'm back in L.
A.
I should have called you Yeah.
You should have.
I said I was sorry.
No, you didn't.
Okay.
Good to hear from you, BoJack.
No [SIGHS.]
Ugh.
[SIGHS.]
What the? Okay, thank you.
What's going on here? Fundraising dinner for the Peanutbutter for California campaign.
All right, I'm just gonna Sorry.
It's a fundraiser.
Uh BoJack! I love your ironic take on black-tie attire.
It really says, "I truly don't care what you think of me.
" This light bulb won't let me in to your house without paying.
Ah, sorry about that.
Gotta raise those funds.
Can't I just Thanks for your support, buddy.
Means so much.
Erica! Hey Look at you, with the right number of ears! Look, I just Twenty thousand dollars a plate.
[GROWLS.]
Hmm! [POPS.]
Oh.
Hey, do you have another bathroom? They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.
Because if I were pregnant, it would be bad luck to tell you this early.
Presuming it was early.
But I'm not pregnant.
This is just a normal, non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.
There's a bathroom in the pool house.
You're a lifesaver.
Pardon me! Out of my way.
Uh-oh.
Am I in Ithaca? Because you are looking "gorges" this evening.
Well, I must be in Nazi Germany, because you're "not so" bad yourself.
I'm sorry, yours was better.
[BOJACK.]
Hi.
Whoa.
[MUNCHES.]
Well, I should go.
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife is talking to my other ex-wife.
You have two ex-wives here? Katrina's his campaign manager.
[PEANUTBUTTER.]
And Jessica Biel loves getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.
If it isn't my two favorite ladies, in the same room! This is great.
Hey.
BoJack, I'm busy.
You haven't seen me for a year and a half.
Yeah, because you disapp No, I am not doing this now.
Why don't you get yourself a drink? I will get a drink.
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

I especially want to thank my pro-fracking pals for being here tonight.
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack," but we did it anyway, and it all worked out.
Love you, sweetie.
Mm-hmm.

Oh, my God.
I can't die! I'm not famous enough yet to make the "In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars! I have so many regrets! I just picked up a family sitcom where the mom is a zombie! [MOANS.]
It's called Mombie, and it's terrible! I have a condition where every time I sense a shift in power dynamics, I have a tiny orgasm! I have no original ideas, I just repeat things I hear.
I've never been in love! I've never been in love! I tried gay at theater camp! I regret everything! [PEANUTBUTTER.]

Hello? Is anyone getting any bars? I'm not getting any baa-rs.
Can someone validate my valet ticket? I would like to go home now.
There's no way out.
Okay.
Everybody stay sane.
I propose we set each other on fire for warmth.
Who wants to be set on fire first? Not me, I'm Jessica Biel.
[WOMAN.]
Yeah, that's right.
The natives are getting restless, so why don't you say something to comfort them? Okay.
Everyone, remain calm! No one's going to light anyone on fire.
For one thing, that'd eat up a lot of oxygen and who knows how much we have down here.
[MAN.]
I want oxygen! [MAN SCREAMS.]
Air! I need air! [GUESTS SCREAMING.]
God.
You okay, sweetie? I think so.
That was really scary.
Yeah.
At least we know no one is specifically at fault.
Well, except for San Andreas.
This was because you fracked under our house.
I told you fracking was dangerous, and you didn't listen.
And now our house is ruined and we're trapped underground, and we're all going to die! Is this one of our sexy fights? [YELLS.]
No! Hmm.
[SIGHS.]
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
You can be mad at me or get drunk with me, but you can't do both.
Watch me.
Oh, what the shit? [CREAKS, CRASHES.]
Oh, fish.
[TODD.]
Uh hello? What are you doing in there? Uh, I live here.
Didn't you know there was a huge party going on? I was going to go to the party after my bath, but then I realized the bath was the party.
Oh, God.
Well, I'm not waiting around to be rescued like some chump.
Come on, let's go.
[TODD.]
Whoa! We gotta go in there? Well, I don't see any other way.
Sometimes life is like the second season of Friday Night Lights You gotta push through and hope there's better stuff ahead.
Aw-ww! Guys, let's all try to just stay cool and make the best of things, huh? "Make the best of things"? You idiot, we're trapped and we're terrified.
Okay, settle down, you future hard Jeopardy question.
Let's hear what the idiot has to say.
So that's a re-up on the idiot part? How are we supposed to make the best of things? We're stuck underground.
This is true.
But most of us are important celebrities, so someone will come for us soon.
And for you regulars, I'm sure they'll bring you up with us! What do we do till then? We're actors! I say we put on a show.
Who's with me? A show? Who will be the star? Me, I assume.
Sure you'll be the star, and you'll be the star! And you'll be the star! We'll all be the star! Folks, I promise you we will be out of here in no time.
[CHEERING.]
And that's when I realized I just don't have the face for bangs.
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
You're too kind! Thank you.
Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing Tale from the Above Ground.
Who's next? I can't take this anymore.
I need to get out.
This is the longest I've gone without moisturizing, and I feel like a lizard! Humph.
No offense.
It's only been 72 hours.
I'm missing my general meeting at CBS.
I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.
I can't live like this! We've gotta light someone on fire.
I'm starting to think that less-famous Michelle Monaghan has the right idea about lighting people on fire.
Thank you.
Come on, party people, keep it together.
Let's not forget why we're here To raise money for my campaign, and more recently, to not go crazy and murder each other.
Can someone please bring me my car? It's a Prius.
A silver Prius.
You're killing me, Zach.
[SIGHS.]
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you can do this.
Be the leader that I know you can be.
Yeah.
You're right.
I've totally got this.
[BANGS.]
What in the world? "Vox clamantis in deserto.
" It is I.
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz! We're saved! Wow! Oh, thank God.
A leader.
[DIANE LAUGHS.]
[BOJACK.]
Sh.
What's going on down here? Anyone's looking for us? We're cool.
Just being cool, don't worry.
Diane, have you just been getting drunk with BoJack this whole time? What? I'm still mad at you.
[BOJACK LAUGHING.]
Citizens, remain calm.
Yeah, that's what I've been saying! Rescue workers are coming but it could be a while.
State emergency funds have been depleted due to budget overruns on a costly bridge to Hawaii that's being constructed.
Oh, yeah! Since a woodchuck is a digging animal, I came to get you out early.
Is that what a woodchuck is? Why did I think it was like a beaver? What's it like out there, Woodchuck? Whole neighborhood totaled? Is the city in chaos? No, it's really just your house.
Because of all the fracking that's been happening underneath your house.
Oh! Interesting! Ay-yi-yi.
Oh, right, right.
So you just burrowed down here to rescue your political opponent's top donors.
That's convenient.
It was actually very inconvenient, but I put politics aside to save you people from dying.
Three cheers for Woodchuck! [ALL.]
Hip, hip, hooray! Please, don't cheer too loudly.
The tunnel is very delicate.
Hip, hip, hooray! Seriously, I think it's best to Hip, hip, hooray! [RUMBLING.]

So turns out three cheers was probably an adequate number of cheers.
[RUMBLING.]
What was that? Just keep walking.
God, I can't wait to get home.
I don't even have a home anymore.
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all my different colored hats I never wear? Well, if you need another couch to crash on, there's always my place.
Didn't you move in with Ralph? Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.
Just in case, I guess.
In case of what? [FAINT CHATTERING.]
What was that? Whoa! Oh! [YELPS.]
Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn? [ANTS GASP.]
[CHATTERING.]
Did you say you're a princess? That's just my name.
I'm a manager.
It's like an agent.
It's totally different.
Is it, though? Silence! You negotiate deals? Mm-hmm.
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.
[ANT LEADER LAUGHS.]
My hands they're crushed.
There's no way I can dig us back out now.
Well, I can dig! Actually, no one should dig.
Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.
The slightest provocation, could cause another collapse that would crush us all.
[ALL GASP.]
I know that because I bought a sitcom about fracking, The Frack Shack.
It's New Girl meets fracking.
[CHUCKLES.]
Oh, God, no one's gonna watch that show, huh? [GROANS.]
Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.
Parcel out food and water and see how much we've got.
I'll assign team leaders.
Oh, no.
I'm sensing a shift in power.
[GROANS.]
[GUESTS CHUCKLING.]
All right.
Um God! For you, a banana because you're so appealing.
Yeah.
And for you, a radish.
Enjoy.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.
I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.
And who made you the food captain? Woodchuck.
Exactly.
He's in charge.
Excuse me, you have not been allocated those rations.
I'm a horse.
I need more food, and I'm a celebrity.
Everyone down here is a celebrity.
Not the caterers.
Relinquish the food.
Hey.
Here's your chance.
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.
This man has already reached his allotted food portion for the day.
Who said we have to go by your rules? Yeah, who made you leader of underground? I'm just gonna take all this and You've appointed me.
Yes, I under citizens, look Keep it together.
[GRUNTS.]
Weird stuff going on downstairs.
[CLICKING.]
Humph.
I can't believe this is my life.
Uh-oh.
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze? I'm trapped underground and it's all my husband's fault and I'm gonna die in this mansion in a mass grave with his ex-wives.
Okay.
But on the bright side Look, Mr.
Peanutbutter loves you, you got a cool job, you got friends.
Jesus, you're right.
Even when I was above ground, I wasn't satisfied.
Oh, my God.
I'm the problem! [SOBBING.]
Whoa! What the? Why can't I be happy? Am I busted? No.
It I am! I'm a pit.
I'm a pit that good things fall into! Diane, you're not a pit.
I'm a pit! [SOBBING.]
[SIGHS.]
I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.
It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.
You disappeared for a year and a half.
So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.
If you were back in L.
A.
, why didn't you call me? I wasn't ready.
Ready? For what? I wanted to be better when you saw me again.
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.
And even if I did get better, the best I could ever be is still just some other version of me.
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.
I need you in my life.
Really? You're the biggest asshole I know, and you're the only thing that makes sense to me.
[DIANE SIGHS, MOANS.]
People should be able to have some control over their lives down here.
Yeah! People need boundaries.
Leadership means sometimes being the bad guy.
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy! I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.
That's not That's a point for Mr.
Peanutbutter.
And I'm the good guy, so that's two points for me.
What points? There are no points.
This is not a game! Well, maybe there should be points.
Yeah! Points! People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.
Well, I'm the one who came down here to save you in the first place.
Surely I get points for that.
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.
He's right! What?! If you came down to save us, why are we still here? [ALL.]
Yeah! You had one job, and you couldn't do it! Yeah! That's right.
Minus point for Woodchuck.
I implore you not to fall into a mob mentality.
He called us a mob! Let's kill him! Yeah! Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy is as broken as his hands.
That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.
An outsider like me, the guy whose house this is.
[CHANTING.]
Peanutbutter, Peanutbutter.
Peanutbutter everybody.
[CHANTING.]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! Me! Peanutbutter! Me! Peanutbutter! [FAINT CHANTING.]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter [SNORING.]
BoJack.
BoJack.
BoJack.
What? Did you know I can juggle? Cool.
Are you okay? I mean, outside of our current situation of being buried alive and almost out of alcohol except for cooking sherry and Midori? It's just been a rough couple years with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.
And Corduroy? Cordu-what now? Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson? Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"? Oh, yeah, him too.
And now I got this girl in my house, this daughter-type.
You got daughter? Ruh-roh.
[CLATTERS.]
Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh.
" Supposed to help her figure out who her mother is.
But I don't know where to start.
Did she try sending mutual consent form to the adoption agency? What, what words? Well, if it's closed adoption, you send a mutual consent form.
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!" If Mom says same thing, boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame! How do you know about that? I had an adopted brother.
And also for a while, I hoped I was adopted.
Ugh! Huh.
Whoa! Ooh! Who dares disturb Queen Antonia? My name is Princess Carolyn.
I represent the soldiers of Subcolony K-147, who feel they're doing all the work while reaping none of the spoils.
Everything my soldiers do benefits the colony.
I had this same conversation with Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Believe me, this doesn't end well for you.
[SIGHS.]
What are your demands? [WHISPERS.]
They want to have sex with your drones.
My drones? [DANCE MUSIC PLAYS.]
Mm-hmm.
Oliver, assemble the small council.
Uh, If we're gonna be down here a while, can I get a new towel? [GUESTS CHANTING.]
Woodchuck's aa-always telling us what to do! He says help is coming, but how does he know? What if he's lying? [WAILS.]
And I have still not been validated! If you could all be patient We're sick of waiting! It's time for new leadership.
That attempted movie star is right! I declare Mr.
Peanutbutter President-for-life of Underground.
[GUESTS.]
Yeah! [GRUNTING.]
Uh, uh, oh! Thank you! What? No! What do we do with Woodchuck? He must be made an example of.
[MAN.]
Get him! Yeah! All right, guys, all right.
Calm down.
We don't need to "get him.
" Let's just tie him up someplace where he can't hurt us anymore with his dangerous ideas.
Do not tie me up.
That isn't necessary.
No, don't no! [CHANTING.]
Peanutbutter! No! Peanutbutter! Thank you, thank you all.
As my first act as President-for-life, I declare that everyone is allowed to eat and drink whatever they want! [ALL.]
Yeah! [CRASHING.]
[GROANS.]
[WHIMPERS.]
Agh! I'm starving, and not the normal celebrity kind of starving like I always am.
Or even red-carpet-season starving.
Where's the food? [WOODCHUCK.]
You ate all the food.
This is it! Nobody's coming for us.
We need to kill someone for food.
Hmm! Oh! Let's eat Mr.
Peanutbutter! He has the word "peanut butter" in his name! [ALL.]
Yeah! Guys, guys, guys, maybe we don't need to eat anybody! [ALL GROAN.]
What's this now? Let's listen to the guy who's saying don't kill me.
He's got some interesting ideas.
Listen to me, everyone.
Please.
I'm known for monologues that sum things up at the end of the show.
I drive a Prius, which means I'm a good person.
Let's not surrender to our basest instincts.
I know times are tough, but I'm sure if we band together and really concentrate on the problem at hand, we can, as a group of friends [SCREAMS.]
Oh, my God.
Biel! The rule of man is over.
Now begins the rule of fire.
[HOWLS.]
Oh, why? Jessica, no.
I will no longer be shackled by the civilized society of the above ground.
This is Underground, and the only law here is flame.
The fire wants not for justice.
The fire wants not for reason.
The fire desires only to be fed! Feed the fire! The fire is my new god! [MOANS.]
Oh, God! I'm so sorry, Mr.
Peanutbutter, but the tide has turned and I side with the fire now.
Tonight, we dine on Zach Braff.
Tomorrow, canine cuisine! No.
You, take him to his spot, and make him stay.
[SQUAWKS.]
No! No! Please! Listen to reason this time! [GULPS.]
Ah-hh! I think that's all of it.
I can't go back to my old life sober.
It's so empty.
Okay, okay.
Here's the secret to being happy.
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually you'll forget you're pretending.
Maybe you're right.
I just need to stop complaining and work harder.
Everyone else is doing it.
Why am I so special? [DOOR BANGS.]
Lock him in here! Please! Diane, my sweet wife.
What's going on? Marvin Gaye.
The People of Underground have a new god, the fire.
And for my crimes I will be fed to its ravenous flames.
My only hope is the meat of Zach Braff proves lasting, but I fear by daybreak, there will be no Braff meat left.
What's going on? Four Non-Blondes.
Everybody out except the prisoner.
[DIANE.]
No! Easy on the merchandise! Get off me! Well, it's been a tough week, lots of back and forth, but I think we've reached an agreement that meets everybody's needs.
"The queen will share male sex servants with the soldiers" for one night of magnificent, sensuous splendor, a gorgeous bacchanal of hedonistic delights, "with a second orgy pickup option, pursuant on success of the first.
" [HISSING.]
My clients are satisfied with those terms.
Great.
Now can we please return to the surface world? All my favorite clouds are up there.
Oh, I like this one.
He's got moxie and a soft thorax.
How did you find your fleshy self in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow? We were at this big Beverly Hills fundraiser.
There was an earthquake, and now everyone's trapped underground.
Did you say Beverly Hills? Ugh! Of course.
Surface dwellers are always moving in on our territory.
First they move here, then taxes go up, the next thing you know, there's a Whole Foods.
How am I supposed to concentrate on a great orgy when I've got gentrification on my mind? No, we've got to get those interlopers out of here.
Let's Hey! Hold on.
Uh [JESSICA.]
Mr.
Peanutbutter, did you or did you not tell us we could eat whatever we wanted? [ALL.]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter! We gotta do something.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty thing that's ever happened to me and now they're gonna set him on fire.
Okay.
What would non-hungover Diane do? She's smart.
I don't know.
I need water.
There is no more water.
That's the problem.
"Choodwuck" is right.
Wait, isn't there water, under the ground? Like, a well? Yeah! And we're underground.
If we dig, we'll get water! Do not dig.
The ground is very volatile.
Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels! Mr.
Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.
Any last words before we light you on fire? Yes, if I could just say, "Don't light me on fire"? The fire bends to no man's will.
Nothing can defeat the fire.
Only [DIANE.]
Water! [JESSICA.]
What? [GASPS.]
Oh, wow, it's really water.
Water is stronger than fire.
Wait, let's not really forget how ugh! Water is my new god now! Oh, boy.
Clear gold! All right, water! H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot! Hang on.
It's it's not stopping.
Which is great! You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.
H-2-Oh, no! [GUESTS WHIMPERING.]
Well, I guess this is it.
[BANGS.]
Oh, God! It's another earthquake! [ALL SCREAMING.]
How is this happening? [ANTS.]
Heave! Heave! Heave! Get them out of here! Okay.
No! Please! I'm important down here! [GUESTS.]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [CRASHES.]
Oh, what an eyesore.
The HOA will be hearing about this.
We are never talking about any of this ever again.
Whew.
So I will see you tomorrow.
We've got a rally in Bakersfield and then we're touring a tennis ball factory in Modesto.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I don't tell you that enough.
It's okay.
If this governor thing is really important to you It's not.
You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.
I don't want to be governor.
I just wanted people to like me.
Well, I like you.
Come on, Diane, let's go home oh, right.
Well, thanks for inviting me to your party.
I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.
Sure.
You guys hungry? I could eat.
Ethiopian? Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.
I should go home.
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.
He's probably worried about me.
I'm down for Ethiopian.
I love that sponge bread.
What do they call it, "injera"? Yeah, injera.
Injera, right.
That's right.
Yeah, that's good bread.
So I send in the form, and if my mom wants to meet me too, then we meet? Yeah.
And if she doesn't want to meet me, then I get to feel that hot sting of rejection all over again.
What a fun adventure this all is.
You know what is fun? You coming with me to my first day on my new show.
"BoJack Horseman in F.H.B.A. Los Angeles, starring BoJack Horseman as 'the Judge.'" 
What is F.H.B.A.? 
I think it's one of those shows about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold? And there may be numbers or something? Then, they call "the Judge.
" I'm just excited to get out of the house.
I've been getting really fidgety cooped up on that hill.
Like I got tiny little bumps crawling around on the inside of my skin, you know? Totally.
Look at this guy, texting in the middle of the intersection.
You have been judged to be a shitty driver.
I'm the Judge.
I sentence you to kiss my ass.
Boom! You got "judged.
" It feels good to be a dramatic actor again.
To make someone laugh is a craft, to be sure, but to make someone cry, on purpose, that is a precious gift.
Hey, I'm Miles, the production intern.
Can I get you anything? Water? That's so sweet of you.
Actually, that's so his job of him.
Hey, PA, whose name I already forgot.
It's Miles, and I'm an intern.
Still not interested.
Can you take my daughter to "video village"? I wanna make sure she sees me at my most awesome, which is with a slightly high angle to avoid appearance of a double chin.
Note to director.
Right this way.
Okay.
Quiet! Rolling! Previously on F.H.B.A. Los Angeles I may be a human rights lawyer, but those skanks are human wrongs.
I'll tell you the same thing I tell kids in the cancer ward.
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to win and/or cure cancer.
Tonight, the girls return from Booty Boot Camp and face new judge, BoJack Horseman.
Will BoJack turn the other cheek, or is this the week the booties hit the floor? This is Felicity Huffman's Booty Academy: Los Angeles! Um what's all this then? On Booty Academy, we're here to find out who's got the right behind and who's going to be left behind.
BoJack, do you have anything you'd like to say to the contestants before we give our verdict? No, I'm good.
Very well.
Calliope, you are "ready for this jelly.
" You can stay another week.
"Tasha, our 'anaconda don't want none.
" Cover up your bottom and go.
No! Your booty's been adjudicated! Cut! This is bullshit! Callin' my manager! Remind me what this show is? I know, remind me? my publicist! Felicity Huffman's Booty Academy.
It was supposed to be Felicity Huffman's Future Leaders of America, but it got retooled a little by the network.
So are we judging who has the best booty? Whoa, BoJack, no.
That is so degrading.
So if it's not about their butts, then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot? Because I'm an honest and impartial judge.
And if there's one thing I'm famous for, it's that I cannot lie.
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.
Hey, can we go home now? Being around all these skinny L.A. ladies makes me feel like a blob.
Well, I gotta shoot for, like, ten more hours.
Are you serious? Apparently, it takes three hours to set up the "badonka-donka-dobstacle course.
" So making TV is like a full-time job? Then why is it so bad? I just assumed people weren't trying.
Uh, I don't mean to butt in here, but shouldn't your daughter be in school? Shouldn't you be "Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"? I graduated early and took a gap year.
My friend Maryssa is backpacking through Europe, but lucky me, I get to hang out in this butt-infested warehouse.
Oh.
All right.
Someone better be checking the pH levels of that Jacuzzi because these bitches are basic.
Hey, you wanna explore the back lot? They got a whole area that was built to look like downtown Toronto.
That's where they shoot the stuff set in New York.
Are you allowed to just leave the set? What are they gonna do? Dock my pay? I'm an intern.
They don't pay me.
I got all the power! Princess Carolyn, you are going to love Stilton Acres.
We have a sauna and a tennis court and a giant hedge maze.
And if you make it all the way through the maze, you get some sugar water.
And you're gonna love the Feast of Saint Squeaky.
It's the holiest of all mouse holidays.
We prepare a feast of Swiss Because it's the holiest of all cheeses? Because it was all our ancestors could carry when they were trying to escape for their lives.
Oh because it has holes! That's very funny.
Thanks.
I really want you and my parents to get along.
They can be kind of a lot, especially around the holidays.
I'm sure I'm going to love them.
And they're gonna love me.
I'm Princess Carolyn! I'm sure they will too.
But let's wait until after they love you to tell them about, you know, Philbert.
Of course.
But what about her? Don't worry.
She's on her phone.
Unless Ralph and Princess Carolyn's secret baby starts to trend, she won't notice anything we do or say.
Stefani? Stefani? Whoa.
Katrina! Just the person I wanted to talk to! How's hotel life? Marvelous! Room service, tiny ketchup bottles, handy list of cable channels.
Now I know why so many people like being homeless.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, that's not On the phone, darling.
Well, I just found you the perfect new campaign headquarters.
I'm gonna sign the lease now, unless you think of a reason I shouldn't.
Nothing comes to mind.
Great! It's done.
Now, what did you wanna talk to me about? I'm dropping out of the race.
What?! Woodchuck's a better leader than I'll ever be.
This election is about bigger things than just you and Woodchuck.
What is it about then? It's about hope, and freedom, and powerful lobbyists who pay me to elect a governor I can control so we can get legislation passed that allows them to build private prisons on what are now protected wetlands.
Well, hopefully those evil lobbyists can find some other puppet to do their bidding.
Why would you hope that? I'm done running for governor, so you're fired.
No hard feelings, right? You idiot.
I will end you! Bye, Cruella! Hello.
Stefani! Hello.
Oh, darling, you're home.
Nice to meet you.
Princess Carolyn! Hello.
I'm Poppy! This is my wife, Mimi.
And this is our son, Sissy.
And this is my wife, Missy.
And the boys, Tweeds, Nantucket, and Loophole! Ugh.
It's so wonderful to meet you all! Can I get you a cocktail? Oh.
No, thank you.
Wine? That's all right.
I will consider it a personal affront if you won't at least have a beer.
I shouldn't.
What about a very caffeinated coffee? No.
Raw shellfish? Not tonight.
Cigarette? I don't smoke.
That's okay.
You can just stand around me while I smoke.
No, I don't want to.
Cocaine, then? I so appreciate that, and I hate to be rude, but I really don't think it's a good idea.
Would you like me to punch you in the belly real quick so you remember what it's like to be alive? That's a rich person thing.
Oh, I know.
I grew up around rich people.
But I'm actually good, as far as belly-punchings go.
Well, can I at least offer you a ride on our private rollercoaster? Surely, there's no reason you wouldn't want to do that.
So if you decline, I will be offended.
Oh.
Also, not that it's relevant, but the rollercoaster is specifically discouraged for children under five and pregnant women.
But since you are neither of those, obviously, there's no reason you will not want to ride on our family's really fun rollercoaster.
Okay, look, the truth is Hey, Dad! Why don't you tell Princess Carolyn one of your great golf stories? Say, there's an idea.
Yes! So here I am with a mashie when what I need is a niblick.
Wow, golf.
Fore! Am I right? Yes, that's exactly right.
Golf.
Californians, this is an endorsement! My message is simple.
If you want to vote Peanutbutter, vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz is a vote for Peanutbutter.
Uh Since Peanutbutter likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz, vote like Mr.
Peanutbutter Excuse me for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
So if we want to vote for Woodchuck, we should vote for you? No.
Yes.
By voting for Woodchuck.
Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
I look forward to moving past the political divisiveness of this campaign and finally focusing on the issues.
What's with the gorilla feet? As I've explained before, my hands were crushed during the fracking incident.
There were no hand transplants readily available, but gorilla feet are somewhat hand-like.
So I am using them temporarily while my doctors find me more suitable replacements.
They sure made a monkey out of you, huh? They did no such thing.
Gorillas are apes.
I feel that went pretty well.
Yes, well, thank you for dropping out of the race.
Rest assured, under my stewardship, the state will be in good You were gonna say "hands" weren't you? Ugh.
So, what's next for us two amigos? Mr.
Peanutbutter, we don't need your help on the campaign.
We are running virtually unopposed.
I think our team can handle it from here.
Wha-wha-wha-what? The best way you can help us is to go back to your regular life and stay out of politics forever.
So this chapter of my life is over? Doggy, doggy.
What now? Coochy-coochy-coochy Hey, Mom.
You got something in the mail.
Have I received any gentleman callers today? I'm expecting a visit from Corbin Creamerman.
You know what? I'll check.
You could learn a thing or two from him, Henrietta! Mm-hmm.
Hey, where have you been? I'll make coffee.
Oh, uh well, Miles actually took me to check out UCLA.
He took me to a party, and I got to sleep in a dorm room, and Wow, look at the time.
That's enough questioning of me, and where I've been, and what I've been doing.
See ya later! Hold up.
Did you and that PA hook up last night? BoJack! We didn't just hook up.
Miles is a really interesting soul, and I feel like we connected.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Sit down.
Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear from that guy again.
Okay, actually, I am, because when I left his dorm he said he would, and I quote, "Definitely text me.
" Oh, wow, I didn't realize.
Should we plan the wedding for you and teenage-boy-you-slept-with who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"? Very funny.
Believe me, I take no pleasure in telling you this, but that kid is never, ever, ever Ooh! BoJack Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.
Now, where was I? Right.
You'll never ever hear from this guy again.
But, I Ba-ba-ba! In fact, if he texts you, I will do a hundred pushups.
That's how sure I am, since there is no possible way "Had a great time last night.
Kilometers.
" "Kilometers"? It's an inside joke between me and Miles.
Not inside enough.
I figured it out and it's dumb.
Ooh.
He wants to take me to a party tonight.
Shouldn't you be doing pushups? Nope, can't.
Impossible.
Anyone who says they did a pushup is lying.
That him canceling? Classic move.
No, he wants to spend the day together.
Oh.
Well, you wanna have breakfast first? I got a box of crullers, of which one remains.
Nah, I'm good with this coffee.
I'll be home for dinner, though.
Bye! Okay.
Forty-six, 47 Ah! I could do this all day.
We have gathered in Todd's new apartment to discuss the future of PB Livin'.
You told me this was an intervention to get Todd to stop coming up with awful ideas.
That was a pretense to get you to show up.
What? It was Todd's idea.
What else you got, Todd? Well, I got this one thing.
I don't know.
It might be pretty dumb.
You bite your tongue.
Yes, bite it all the way off! All your ideas are beyond terrible.
Well, in that case, I guess I must have "terrible" business instincts.
You do! Because I wanna hear it.
They say "the devil's in the details," so let's summon the devil! Okay, so you know how hard it is to get your kids to go to the dentist? I don't.
But what if dentists had a friendlier face? Ooh! What if you could take your kids to a dentist's office where all the dentists were clowns? What?! Kids love clowns! Do kids love clowns? Actually Don't they? Who else would clowns be for? Because adults don't love clowns.
That is true.
Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.
So kids must love clowns, because otherwise, why would there be clowns? That is sound logic.
Okay.
I want these clown dentists laughing maniacally as they drill into the teeth of America's children, starting yesterday! As someone who does have children, I have to say, a lot of kids are actually terrified of clowns! Are they? Hm.
That would have been helpful information before I committed.
But my word is my bond and I already said yes, didn't I? Okay, so do we find dentists and train them to be clowns, or do we get clowns and train them to be dentists? Why don't we get clowns and dentists and they can train each other? Oh, somebody call the police department, because you are on fire! Aw, jeez.
And without missing a beat, I say, "Well, when life gives you lemons, make an Arnold Palmer.
" It's been so wonderful getting to know you all these last few days.
We're so happy to have you.
Now, let the festivities begin.
Sissy, hand out those cat ears.
Cat ears? And this is for you.
I want those.
See, the feast is about remembering the ancient tale of a heroic mouse named Squeaky.
And we always start by wearing cat ears and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy, the cat tyrant, King Pusspuss.
Looks like Princess Carolyn won't need any cat ears to look evil.
Okay, that's actually a stereotype.
Cats do take baths.
Darling, licking yourself does not qualify.
Aw, come on, it was funny.
Oh! Right in the cat gut! Hooray! Sorry, it gets a little graphic.
I really wish you'd told me your family's holiday was so anti-cat.
It's just an old story about one bad cat.
It's not about every cat.
Death to all cats! Whoo-hoo! All right! I forgot about that part.
It's kinda like church.
You say the words so many times, you forget what they mean.
Oh-hh Agh! Hello, Hollyhock.
Oh, come on.
Wait there.
There's a spare bulb in the kitchen.
I've been sitting in that chair for five hours waiting to do this.
Agh, damn it! Son-of-a! What? Hello, Hollyhock.
What are you trying to do? I'm trying to keep you out of trouble with a showman's flair for the dramatic.
I texted you I was gonna be home late.
You don't tell me when you're home late.
This is my house.
You need to ask permission.
What? You're not my dads.
I'm just looking out for you.
You spent four days with this kid, I'm worried There's nothing to worry about! We like each other.
Yeah, now.
But come on, Hollyhock.
He's a teenage boy whose job is to be around hot women in skimpy outfits all day.
You think he's gonna want What? No, I just mean that What, you think I'm not attractive enough for him? Well, you're the one who said you were a blob.
Do you think I'm a blob? No.
What kind of person calls his own daughter a blob? You said "blob.
" I said I "felt" like a blob.
Do you think I'm a blob? I just I just think L.A. is a superficial town and you need to be careful.
Well, Miles likes me just the way I am.
And that's the kind of person that I want to spend my time with.
Hollyhock, wait.
Wait.
Wait! I get it! It's my weight! Yeah I'm sorry about all that.
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats? They don't hate cats.
Now I get why you didn't want to tell your family about the baby.
Okay, I was a little nervous.
But they'll come around.
Besides, what am I supposed to do? They're my family.
And what are me and Philbert? Oh Can't believe she's still pissed.
You shouldn't have called her a "blob.
" I'm a blob too! We're both blobs! How about just as a general rule, don't ever call a woman a blob? Never! What if I meet a woman whose name is Barbara Lob? And I call her "B" for short.
"B.
Lob.
" Maybe instead of figuring out the woman blob workaround, you should just tell Hollyhock you're sorry.
I still think Miles is up to something.
Why is it so hard for you to believe someone could genuinely like your daughter? Because she's like me! Okay.
Do you think maybe this could be more about you than it is about her? Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work to do on myself.
Everyone knows that.
But the important thing right now is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.
Try to stay on topic, Diane.
Well, an open conversation about your concerns with No, that's too Diane-y.
She'd never buy it was coming from me.
Then why do you want my advice? I got it.
If I can somehow prove to her what a jerk Miles is, then she'll have to like me more by default.
That's the BoJack way.
BoJack, no! Oh oh Ooh, that's that's nice.
Goldie, how would you like to advance to the final round? I would do anything, and I mean, anything.
So I did it.
I had sex with the PA.
You had sex with him? That's what you wanted, right? I just said "seduce" the PA.
Doesn't that mean have sex with him? No, I just wanted you to, like, get him all hot and bothered.
Eh? And ready to sleep with you.
Then once you get him on audiotape saying that he would sleep with you What? come up with some excuse to get out of there with virtue intact.
That's a lot of specifics you just assumed I would know.
Okay, well, the important thing is, we got him now.
Tell Miles what you told me.
I had sex with the PA.
What PA? I think his name was "Eggberg"? What? Not him? That's the intern.
You said "PA.
" Did you think I was a PA? Nice! Why'd you want her to sleep with me? Not sleep with.
You told a contestant you would advance her to the final round if she slept with a PA? I said "seduce.
" There is a distinction.
We make a show about empowering women and lifting them up, and you cheapen it with this coarse vulgarity.
I cannot lie.
You disgust me.
This was all a big misunderstanding.
Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.
You're not fit to judge anyone's character, or their booties.
So it is about judging booties.
Hey, BoJack.
Miles.
Don't want me dating your daughter, you could have told me.
I'm sorry.
Maybe we could've worked out some sort of deal.
What do you mean? All right, so I got this screenplay, and I think it's a really fresh area.
It's about a production intern who wants to be a writer.
Oh, wow.
I think it could go somewhere if it got in front of the right person.
So if you have like an agent or a manager you could give it to, that would be awesome, and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.
I promise.
So you were right.
He was a dirtbag.
Yeah.
I was kinda hoping I was wrong for once.
If it makes you feel any better, you were wrong about all the other parts of this.
Diane, you are so bad at making people feel better.
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock? She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.
But for now, if she believes someone can love her for who she really is, then why would I take that away from her? BoJack, you gotta get one of these massages.
Oh-hh! Okay.
Goodbye, darling.
It was good seeing you.
It was so much fun seeing you both.
Thank you for hosting us.
It was so nice to get away for the week and learn all about your charming little traditions that didn't freak me out at all.
Bye-bye! Did our little city mouse have a nice time in the country? Everything was wonderful.
And your little companion was darling For a week.
But I do hope the next one you bring home knows how to appreciate a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.
Well, for your information, there's not gonna be a "next one," because I love Princess Carolyn and we're having a baby and I couldn't be happier! Oh, my God.
Oh, Mr.
Peanutbutter, I am so relaxed.
I didn't realize how much tension I'd built up in my Oh, my God! Um Mr.
Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room filled with dentist clowns? Don't be ridiculous, Diane.
They're not all dentist clowns.
Half of them are clown dentists.
Just try to ignore them and go about your business.
Okay.
So, this is the incisor.
Doc, if this is what's incisor, I'd hate to see what's outsides 'er.
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk! Please try to focus, Dr.
Boing-Boing.
Ugh! With former rival Mr.
Peanutbutter's support, just yesterday, Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz seemed to be unbeatable, but as a new candidate enters the race, is Woodchuck also "unbeata-Biel"? "UnbeataBiel"? Randy, you wily son of a I've missed you, buddy! Bring it in! "UnbeataBiel"? I'm tired of these politicians who are all talk.
California needs a leader who excels in both comedy and drama and who is beautiful in an approachable girl-next-door way, and who will get all the criminals off the street while simultaneously finding a use for our wetlands.
That's why I'm running for governor.
A candidate you can Jessica-lieve in.
What the?! Let's do it together! I'm with me! Oh-hh! Katrina.
Gadzooks! Not now, Professor Flim-Flam! Of course, Katrina would latch onto Jessica as the beautiful face of her dangerous agenda.
Well, there's no way they could beat Woodchuck, right? No? Because I almost beat him and I don't even know what a governor does.
That's true.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you've got to help.
Woodchuck has no idea what he's up against.
You're right! But are we sure this is the right thing for us? If I jump right back into politics, that's not gonna give me a lot of time to focus on our burgeoning clown dentistry business.
Then it is definitely the right thing for us.
This is an abomination.
It's only till the doctors find better ones.
They're not even hands! Well, they're better than feet, aren't they? What the?! I'm Dr.
Boing-Boing! And I am Dr.
Jennifer Picarello, D.
D.
S.
We come with a message from Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You can tell Mr.
Peanutbutter I don't Ha! Woodchuck! What do you want? You need me, Woodchuck! You've got brain smarts, but your sober-minded policy speeches are no match for the glitz and pizzazz of a Hollywoo starlet.
Even a relatively low-wattage one like Jessica Biel.
He's right.
California loves making movie stars governors.
I was married to both Jessica and Katrina.
I know them inside and out.
And I'm not speaking in a sexual way, although it is also true in a sexual way.
You gotta let me join the campaign! All right.
Great! There's no time to lose.
Quick! Get in Dr.
Boing-Boing's dream-powered smile-mobile! It's been four seconds and I already deeply regret this.
Hey.
Hey, yourself.
I'm sorry I was an asshole.
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing? Seeing how fast I can change channels.
Also, I found all the loose change in the house and I put it in alphabetical order by year.
Do you really think a guy like Miles couldn't ever really like a girl like me? No.
I was just jealous because you were spending a lot of time with him.
He hasn't texted me all day today.
I've been trying to distract myself.
Forget him.
You're gonna meet lots of guys who will fall madly in love with you.
I might have scared him off.
I don't know.
Do you ever get that feeling that like, to know you more is to love you less? Hollyhock, you are an amazing woman and you should never settle for someone who only loves the idea of you.
You are funny, and you're kind, and you're clever.
Am I also pretty? I come on.
What do you want me to say? Obviously, I think you're beautiful.
Well, you don't have to go overboard.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we go get some Cold Stone? That'll take your mind off Miles.
Plus, I'll let you drive the Tesla! Thanks, but I'm not really in the mood for ice cream.
Well, then, forget that.
Let's get a pizza.
I'm actually not hungry.
Oh.
Class, settle down.
Settle down.
It's Ruthie's turn to present her ancestor.
Go ahead, Ruthie.
Okay, Teach-Bot.
Mrs.
Teach-Bot.
Ugh.
My great-great-great grandmother was called Princess Carolyn.
She was an agent and a manager in Hollywoo.
What's the difference between an agent and a manager? Both look to find projects for their clients but only managers can produce.
[CLASS MURMURING.]
What? My mom told me that I come from a long line of strong female cats.
Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12 and it made her one of the toughest.
Mom said, "She could take a lickin' and keep on tickin'.
" This expression refers to clocks, an old fashioned way of timekeeping before we all universally accepted the bean system.
[CLASS.]
"The bean system is the way.
" For Ancestry Day, I'm gonna tell you a particular story about one particular day on which Princess Carolyn faced and overcame particular adversity all the way back in the year 2017.
[RUTHIE.]
The day began like any other.
[GROANS.]
[RUTHIE.]
Princess Carolyn lived with her boyfriend, Ralph.
She was pregnant and very happy.
[SIGHS.]
Sorry I can't go with you to the doctor.
Don't worry about it.
I feel great! Today is crucial.
Stilton Cards has to create its own holiday to really be playing with the big boys.
Hallmark, American Greeting, those chunky cards that play music when you open them.
I just know you're gonna be the next Joey K.
Easter, the guy who invented Arbor Day.
How about "National Friend of a Friend Day?" Is that anything? You'll think of something.
[SLURPS.]
Mm! Give me just a sip of the coffee.
I can have a sip.
One sip.
Today is going to be great.
Oh! [YELPS.]
Hey.
[MOANS.]
Oh-hh! [RUTHIE.]
She was wrong.
Today was gonna suck.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING.]
[RUTHIE.]
Princess Carolyn started her day with a call to BoJack Horseman, her former client-slash-lover.
Ruthie! Inappropriate! Sorry.
[BOJACK.]
Go for BoJack! You like that? I'm trying out some new phone stuff.
Or is "Bo for GoJack" better? Nah, maybe too clever.
I don't want people to think I'm trying.
Sorry, who is this? Princess Carolyn, moron.
Oh, hey, P.
C.
So what do you think? About what? "Go for BoJack!" Or maybe Ugh, stop! You need to get a new agent.
I'm sick of fielding your offers.
Offers? Well, you tell them that I am not doing another reality show.
So degrading.
All they had at craft services was Kirkland snacks, P.
C.
Kirkland snacks.
Well, first of all, I don't work for you, so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.
But, second, these are actually good offers.
Really? Like what? I'm not telling you because Got it.
Busy, busy.
I'm busy too, so I'll call you back later.
Bye.
Don't call.
I don't work for you! How's this for a headline for the blog? You write about this, quote, "BoJack Finally Solves Mystery "of Hollyhock's Mother", comma, "Looks Handsome", colon ": Is Cool.
" End quote.
I still don't understand your plan, or how that's a headline.
The plan couldn't be simpler.
Go to the county courthouse, ask to see all the birth certificates on file, find Hollyhock's, see what it says in the "mother" spot.
They're not just gonna give you the birth certificates.
Well, I gotta try something.
I have this girl at my house who came to me for help, I want to do right by her.
I just don't know if you've thought through Diane, I am a famous.
They will give me the birth certificate.
Everyone gives me everything I want all the time.
It is an existential curse, but a huge day-to-day convenience.
So why do you need me? I don't know.
Just wanted some company.
You told me to use a vacation day because this was, quote, "a feminism-related emergency.
" I got your number! Why didn't you just bring Hollyhock? I was gonna, but she got really into counting her teeth this morning, didn't want to leave the house.
You know how teens are.
Ruthie, this was supposed to be about your ancestor.
Who are all these other "chara-ca-ters"? They fill out the world.
Well, can you try to keep things focused, please? Okay, okay, okay.
[RUTHIE.]
Princess Carolyn had been called to Gekko-Rabitowitz The agency of her nemesis, and nemesis-slash-former lover.
Ruthie! Sorry, Teach-Bot.
She had a lot of former lovers.
She was a fluid sexual being, not a machine.
[RUTHIE.]
But today was all about business.
She was there because she was trying to get her client Courtney Portnoy cast in Corpse "Me If You Can-Can", the 1940's Cannes, France-set story of a can-can dancer who contracts cancer but continues to can-can as a canny cadaver who plays the accordion with Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Kline, Chris Klein, Chris Pine and Chris Kattan.
Got it.
[GASPS.]
Gekko.
Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.
Is it new, or something I've seen you wear literally hundreds of times? [RUTHIE.]
Normally, Princess Carolyn would've been rattled, but that day, she realized Vanessa Gekko no longer had any power over her.
In truth, the woman had challenged and inspired Princess Carolyn, not only to be a better agent, but to be brave enough to try and have it all.
Princess Carolyn wanted to tell her thank you, but instead she said You look tired, "Veronica.
" Oh, I Amazing burn, Princess Carolyn.
Hey, Princess.
We have a little snag.
Did Chris Kattan drop out? Right before his comeback? Right when the world is finally ready to settle for Kattan? No, it's You're fired.
I'm fired? I tried to talk her out of it, but between the gun movie misfiring and her nuptials turning into "nope-tials," and her blaming you for both of those things Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints? Oh, just give me one more chance.
I promise I can get you the lead in that can-can cadaver movie.
[LAUGHS.]
What? Oh, P.
C.
, C.
P.
just made that whole thing up to get you here.
You thought that was real? The 1940's corpse who learns accordion? It sounds so ludicrous.
You did play the short-sighted seamstress in "The Storm on Northern Fortress.
" Well, yeah, but that was just because I wanted to work with Ashton.
We'll talk later, right? I'm so sorry.
Bye.
Did you have a good meeting? [MOCKINGLY.]
Did you get fired? [GROANS.]
Aw.
Sorry you got fired.
Here's a latte.
Oh, uh It's decaf, ma'am.
Thanks, Judah.
You know, one year ago, a setback like this would have really spun me out.
But I don't need Courtney.
Every time we fall, we get back up stronger and better than ever.
Can I get a hallelujah? Is that a sort of pressed juice? I'll have one hallelujah on your desk by 12:45.
Great.
What's next? I noticed your necklace was broken, so I pushed back your appointment, and found a reputable jeweler nearby.
Don't know what I'd do without you, my hairy number two! Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That came out horribly.
Not to speak above my station, but perhaps it would behoove us to entice BoJack Horseman back into our stable.
Ugh! I'm sorry, ma'am.
"Stable" and "behoove" were poor word choices.
I was not trying to engage in punnery during business hours, but we've received 15 more inquiries about BoJack just this morning, and I don't think it's wise to look a gift opportunity in the mouth.
BoJack is off the table.
We're a small management company.
We just need to focus on the clients we have.
[JUDAH.]
You know best.
Who's that dog? Mr.
Peanutbutter [BEEPS.]
Mo for Gister Peanutbutter! Hey, handsome.
Heard you dropped out of the governor's race.
Now let's get you back to work on what really matters show business! I'm going to stop you right there.
I was done.
Can't wait to get back in front of the camera, but right now, I have to help my former political rival defeat my two ex-wives.
One of whom is in the pocket of powerful lobbyists and the other of whom murdered popular actor and soundtrack artisan, Zach Braff, and ate his burnt flesh! Politics as usual, right? Well, when you're ready to work again Gotta go.
They need all hands on deck, because Woodchuck lost his hands underground and they replaced them with creepy lobster claws.
Typical politics! Hey.
So I need this clasp replaced, 24-karat gold.
This is a priceless family heirloom.
Princess Carolyn had gotten her necklace from her mother, who got it from her mother, who brought it from the old country.
When our ancestors first emigrated to America, they were very poor.
Back in the Motherland, they had been doctors and engineers, but here, they struggled to find work.
Every night, they would sing the song of the old country, hoping to reclaim the glory of those days.
[ALL.]
Meow-meow! Meow-meow! Meow-meow Meow-meow, meow-meow! [RUTHIE.]
They slowly sold all their belongings as they attempted to hang on to a middle-class way of life.
[ALL.]
Meow-meow Meow-meow! [LIGHT BULB FIZZLES.]
[RUTHIE.]
But she never sold that necklace, because that was the one gift she could give her daughter.
A treasure from the past and a symbol of the tenacity and stick-to-itiveness that has for generations led my family to always land on their feet.
You can come back in about two hours.
Thank you.
[CLATTERS.]
Sorry, sorry! Wait.
Sorry, sorry.
[CLATTERS.]
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm just looking for something really nice.
This is for a sexy catfish I met on the Internet.
Charley? Princess Carolyn! You work at a jewelry store now? No, I own my own management company.
Oh, yeah.
Good for you.
I'm so proud of you.
Your approval means nothing to me.
So I guess it's good you said "no" to my offer last year.
What offer? I mean, exactly what offer are you talking about? I get so many.
Last year, I reached out to your guy I wanna say, "Ju-do" Judah.
This guy's name was Judo.
I offered to buy VIM and merge it with Vigor.
We would have called the new company, VIMgor.
Oh, right.
That offer.
I couldn't believe when he said you weren't interested.
Well, yeah.
Because I wasn't, and he does what I say.
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.
You got to start over as a manager, and instead of buying VIM, I bought the Utah Jazz.
They're terrible agents, but they're getting better.
Yeah.
Anyway, nice bumping into Oh, sorry.
Careful, please.
Ooh.
[CHARLEY.]
Oopsie.
Oh, boy.
No, no.
[CRASHES.]
Is that valuable? It is.
My great, great, great grandmother was dismayed that her trusted colleague had kept this from her.
Her mind raced, "Was Judah capable of deception?" She hoped what Charley told her wasn't true, but her instincts told her the frog wasn't smart enough to lie.
First quarter, second quarter.
Wow, that's a lot of quarters.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.
Judah, you'll never guess who I just ran into.
No, I won't.
Very astute, ma'am.
It was Charley Witherspoon! Mm-hmm.
Char ley Hmm? Hmm! Wither spoon! Hmm.
Okay.
How does that make you feel? That very short story makes me feel nothing.
I don't think it's your fault as a storyteller.
I often have trouble engaging with narratives.
[RUTHIE.]
His lack of response made her hope it wasn't true.
Could it all have been a misunderstanding involving an enigmatic stranger named "Judo"? So, what's next, then? Ooh, I want to get the life rights to that woman I saw on Instagram who had a pretty coffee.
I bet we could attach Jessica Alba and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.
Okay, but I still don't understand what a manager is.
Do they just say the names of movies and actors? How does that generate revenue? No one knows, Torf.
It's not important! Be quiet, Torf.
Take your Hush Pill.
Yes, Miss Teach [GULPS.]
Uh-hh Continue your presentation, Ruthie.
Thank you.
And finally, Rob Lowe.
Great idea, Princess Carolyn.
But is it possible you've forgotten your doctor's appointment? Oh, fish! It's my fault.
I rescheduled it in an attempt to make your life easier.
Thank you, Judah! I'll call you if I think of any more actor names.
[SIGHS.]
Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba God, this is taking forever.
We've been waiting for 15 minutes.
I know.
Let's just go home.
No, Diane.
How could you even suggest that? This is not about us.
This is for my daughter.
Ugh.
I know what I have to do.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Pardon me.
Important celebrity doing the right thing.
Whoa, a famous guy! And he's doing the right thing? This is like when George Clooney married that less famous lady! Wait.
Don't you mean Jurj Clooners? Who cares? Hello, friend.
Yes, it's me, BoJack Hor Number? I'm sorry, I don't give out my personal phone number.
No, your number.
You need a number or I can't help you, BoJack Hor.
Horseman.
It's Horseman.
I don't look familiar to you at all? Eh.
Come on, BoJack.
Let's get a number.
Wait a minute.
You're Diane Nguyen! I recognize you from your Girl Croosh avatar.
I loved "Twenty Reasons to Try the Diva Cup.
" Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think 20 was too many reasons? No way.
Number 14 blew my mind! Didn't I say it would? We don't have time.
Where do we get a number? That line.
What? And you'll need these [GRUNTS.]
forms.
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper? Can't I just swipe an app or something? Bye, Diane! Keep up the great work! [GIGGLES.]
Oh, get over yourself.
[SIGHS.]
[DOOR OPENS.]
So? What's the prognosis? Hmm I'm trying to think of the best way to put this.
As Charles Lindbergh would say, "Sometimes you fly an airplane, and sometimes you lose a baby.
" In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.
Wait, what? Your pregnancy is no longer viable.
Well, how do we make it viable again? Mm-mm How did this happen? Goodness, I don't know.
I wouldn't beat yourself up.
Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.
There's nothing medically wrong with you.
Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.
Maybe you didn't deserve it because you were unkind once.
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster God or wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.
Oof! This is A lot.
Not for me.
This is my job, so Pretty regular day.
What do I do next? Well, there's a procedure.
We can do it here later this week.
You want Darlene to call someone to drive you home? No, I'm okay.
I don't need anyone.
You're a real tough broad.
Except for, you know, the uterus area.
Pretty weak.
[GASPS.]
Hey, is my necklace ready? Oh, I was going to call you.
When I was working on your necklace, I realized something.
Oh? It's not actually gold, it's just gold plated.
See? No, it's very expensive.
It's pretty, but basically worthless.
And I'm only saying it's pretty to make you feel better.
But, it's from the old country.
It's been in my family for generations.
No, this is costume jewelry from J.
C.
Penney.
Circa 1963.
Somebody just told you a story.
I'm sorry.
Wha huh? So, do you still want a 24-karat gold clasp on this garbage necklace, or? [SNIFFLES.]
Oh-hh! [GASPS, SOBS.]
[RINGTONE PLAYS.]
Oh! Ralph, hey! Hi, honey.
Just checking on how the doctor's appointment went and also to wish you a happy "Acknowledge Your Gardener Day.
" It's a work in progress.
Don't judge.
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.
I'm actually just walking in now.
Oh, hello.
Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn, here for my appointment.
I like your perfume.
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.
You sure it's okay I'm not there with you? Ralph, it's fine.
I'm a big girl.
Everything is so easy with you, Princess Carolyn.
I mean, that's why I love you.
Yeah, easy.
[CHUCKLES.]
That's what the boys in high school liked about me, too.
[CHUCKLES.]
Okay, I'll see you tonight.
I love you.
I love you, too.
[BEEPS.]
[SIGHS.]
[SLURPS, MOANS.]
Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.
Do you need anything else before I go? No.
Thank you.
Should you be drinking that? You don't always know what's best for me, Judah.
Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn? Charley Witherspoon made you an offer to buy Vim, and you went over my head and turned him down without telling me.
Oh.
So it's true.
You lied to me.
Yes.
Because you didn't want to work at a big agency.
You don't fit in with other people.
I You're weird, so you'd rather stay here where you have all the power.
No, Princess Carolyn So you lied to me, and you made me look like an idiot! I was trying to protect you.
If you heard, you'd feel like you had to say yes.
I don't need you to protect me.
If you had time, you could decide what to do next on your own terms, which you did.
Well, that's not your decision to make.
Princess Carolyn, I understand you're upset.
And perhaps your emotions No.
If I can't trust you, then I can't work with you.
You're fired.
[SIGHS.]
Thank you for my time here, Princess Carolyn.
It's been very pleasurable.
Until now.
This part is Sad.
Don't forget, you have reservations at 8:00.
Thank you, Judah.
Good night.
Ruthie, this story has gotten really dark.
It has a happy ending.
I promise.
Well, can we get there soon? This assignment was supposed to be six beans long.
You've already gone on for eight beans.
Okay.
I'm almost finished.
But first, let's check in with BoJack and Diane again.
What have they been up to? [BEEPING.]
Error.
Error.
I'm not leaving without the certificate! I danced your dance, lady.
I filled out that form.
But I will not wait in this line anymore.
Not one person in here offered me a Fiji water, and I am parched from all the yelling I've been doing! BoJack, let's go home.
No, I would like to register a formal complaint.
How do I do that? Complaints are on the eighth floor.
But you need to fill out an application for a complaint registration, which you can get by waiting in line 12-B on the third floor.
You have won this round.
So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.
But she didn't know how to tell him what had happened or how he'd take the news.
Okay, so, what do you think about "National Paperweight Day"? "Thanks for keeping my papers in place.
"I love you as big as outer space.
" Okay, so you'd give that card to a paperweight? Ah, Principessa! And Signor Stilton.
Welcome-a back.
Let's have a drink then, yes? I'll have a glass of ChÃ¢teauneuf-Du-Pape, the red wine inspired by Scandal.
That Kerry Washington has really brought red wine into popularity.
It's a-funny, because I thought that the terroir of the Italian countryside did it.
But, a-no, it's-a Miss Kerry Washington.
Ugh.
Everybody love-a Miss-a Kerry.
And my gal pal here would love some mint tea.
Right? You know it.
Bene, bene.
How was the doctor? He tell you the species? I can't stop thinking about squeezing little Philbert's baby feet.
Aw-ww [RUTHIE.]
She wanted to tell him.
But she also wanted to let him stay in his beautiful hopeful reality, a reality she herself had lived in just hours before, and to which she now longed desperately to return.
Well, the doctor didn't have much info.
You know how doctors are.
But he did say there's nothing wrong with me, so Ah, Miss-a Carrie Underwood.
Ooh! Miss-a Carey Mulligan.
Agh! Miss-a Carey, first name Mariah, right this-a way! Ugh! Look at all of these Miss-a-Carries! [COUGHING.]
Are you okay? I have to go.
Oh.
Well, you want me to drive you? No, it's fine.
I'll just meet you at home.
Hmm.
[RUTHIE.]
But when Princess Carolyn got to the home that she and Ralph shared, she found she didn't have the strength to go inside.
She wanted to go some place familiar, some place that was just hers.
[SIGHS.]
[YELPS.]
Oh! [WHIRRING.]
Shh! Oh, hey, Princess Carolyn.
What is going on here? Only the future.
This is horrifying and it doesn't look legal, whatever it is, you'd better cut me in for ten percent.
I could cut you off a lot more than that.
[CLOWN DENTISTS LAUGHING.]
Whose kid is that? Look, if you didn't want me to turn your apartment into a base of operations for my new clown-dentist venture, you should have specified that when I moved in.
Mommy? Where's my mom? Oh, no! He's waking up.
Hit him with the giggle gas! [SPRAY HISSES.]
Ooh! [GIGGLES.]
[YAWNS.]
[SIGHS.]
Oh! All right.
You're clearly doing important work here.
I'm just gonna have a quick nightcap and go to bed.
What up? Let's rock this party H2 limo and a case of Bacardi [SPLASHING.]
Look at me, I'm a dumb cat queen My baby was the size of a kidney bean Hey, what happened to your necklace? Oh, fish! Fish, fish, fish, fish.
It must have fallen off! [KNOCKING.]
[RALPH.]
Princess Carolyn? Are you in there? [ALL GASP.]
Yeah, just a second! Todd, get these clowns outta here! Go, go, go, go.
Scatter, clowns! Into the night! Go! Go! [PRINCESS CAROLYN.]
Go, scamper! Everybody, out! [CLOWNS WHOOPING.]
Ugh! [SIGHS.]
Okay.
Oh, hello, handsome.
Oh, thank God! You didn't come home, didn't answer your phone.
I was worried.
Aw, you was worried? Judah told me you might be here.
Did you fire him? That hipster Chewbacca, always getting in my personal biz-natch.
I didn't know you still had this place.
Why do you still have this place? Okay, what? Third degree much? Have you been drinking? It's fine, okay? I get to drink because baby went gone! What? "Gone, baby, gone.
" Like that Ben Affleck movie.
That could be a sequel.
"Gone, Baby, Never Was.
" Write that down.
Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn.
It's okay! You know me.
I always land on my feet.
Take a lickin', keep tickin'.
Like a lollipop with Tourette's.
Write that down.
So you were lying earlier at dinner? Is that what you're upset about? That I lied? About losing the baby? About keeping my apartment? I lied? That's the big sad thing that happened? Trying to process what you threw at me.
It's gonna be fine.
I'll be pregnant again in no time.
I'm so sorry.
Let me take you home.
When you're ready to try again I'm ready! I said I was ready.
Okay.
So we'll go back to the doctor, maybe talk about other options.
I don't need other options.
My mother had 12 kids.
My body was made for this.
We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.
Princess Carolyn, I know you wanna do this on your own, but you've had two miscarriages now, and Five! What? I've had five miscarriages.
One last year, now one, and three others before.
But it's whatever.
It's okay.
Why didn't you tell me? Are you kidding? I don't want you looking at me like that.
Like that! I know I can do this.
You can't keep stuff like this from me.
It's not okay.
It's not about you.
It is.
This is about us.
You're not allowed to be mad at me.
This is my bad day.
It's our bad day.
It's so easy for you To love me when everything's good.
Princess Carolyn, I Let me take you home.
No.
You need to live in this.
You need to get used to this, because if you're serious about having a baby with me, this could happen again.
Are you prepared for that? This could happen five more times.
But I'm ready for that.
Because I want this.
Do you want it that bad? [SIGHS.]
I just think we should maybe talk about other options.
Okay.
Here's another option.
Get out of my apartment! I'm sorry.
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.
The one you can take home to your parents.
The one who's easy.
Goodbye, Princess Carolyn.
[SIGHS.]
[DOOR OPENS.]
[CORK SQUEAKS.]
[RINGTONE PLAYS.]
[BEEPS.]
What is it? I'm calling about the offers.
I don't want to do 'em.
What's the point of being famous if you wait in line? If you could politely decline on my behalf I do not work for you, BoJack! I'm sorry.
I started this all wrong.
How was your day? [MOANS.]
Well Because mine was awful.
I mean, truly, one for the books.
Because I'm a good guy trying to do the right thing.
First, I go for my breakfast Pinkberry, which I had earned because I had good intentions for today, they're out of my favorite toppings! So I go across the street to Menchie's, like some kind of hobo.
[CHUCKLES.]
Mm-hmm.
At Menchie's, the stupid teen that worked there raised her eyebrows at me.
"You kidding me? You're trying to judge me? You have very uneven eyebrows and you work at a Menchie's.
" And don't even get me started on the rancid internment camp that is the L.
A.
County Courthouse.
Hey, you wanna know what I do when I have a really bad, awful, terrible day? What? I imagine my great great-great granddaughter in the future talking to her class about me.
She's poised and funny, and tells people about me and how everything worked out in the end.
And when I think about that, I think about how everything's going to work out.
Because how else could she tell people? But it's Fake.
Yeah, well It makes me feel better.
Give it a moment.
Nothing gets by me, Tina.
Uno what I'm thinking? I don't think you have any blues.
I think you put the wild card down, and chose blue, because you want us to think you have blues.
Just go already! Uh, excuse me.
I am employing a little something called "strategy.
" I am taking my time because I enjoy being the center of attention.
Until I put a card down, you have to listen.
It's been your turn for ten minutes.
Well, since you're being so impatient, I'm gonna put my thing down, flip it and reverse it back to Tina.
Uno.
So you did have blues.
TouchÃ©.
Henrietta, don't use a foreign language in front of the child.
She'll get ideas.
It's your turn, Beatrice.
Ah, ah, ah, ah! You okay, Hollyhock? Yeah, I'm I'm awesome.
I feel really good.
I just I need a glass of water.
Oh! Beatrice, trying to slip a nine on a six.
You think I've never seen an old niner-sixer before? Ah! Ow! Whoa, are are you okay? I'm fine! I just Ow! Did you cut yourself? It's okay.
I know what to do.
You need some alcohol, ice, a squeeze of lemon.
You'll forget all about your cut.
I'll be right back.
One.
Oh! Oh! Californians are feeling the pinch, and you butter believe it's "beclaws" of Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
I see, you're referring to my hideous transplant lobster claws in an effort to distract Do you want a governor who can be rendered defenseless with two rubber bands? Woodchuck is down in the polls.
Californians just aren't connecting with his message.
I have a very important policy announcement.
I've got new hands, baby! Now Woodchuck is way up in the polls! I guess his message was connecting with voters after all.
Hey! How you doin'? Looking good.
Mmm Oh! What's the big deal? I have hands too.
There's no way those new hands are as perfect as everyone says.
Nobody's hands are all the way clean.
Computer, zoom in on that thumb.
And enhance.
Zoom in again.
Enhance again.
Zoom in three more times.
Enhance.
Enhance.
Now zoom out once.
De-enhance.
Okay.
What are you doing? Quiet, "Face.
" "Brain" is working on something.
Computer, take a scan on that thumbprint and cross-reference, please.
Ha! Just what I expected.
What? Before Woodchuck, the hands belonged to one Ernest Contralto, a criminal.
The man was a pedophile murderer.
Well, if you gotta murder somebody No, Tom.
Not a pedophile-dash-murderer.
A pedophile-slash-murderer! Oh, no! The way you said "slash" was very scary! At first I didn't like him, on account, uh He didn't have hands? But then he got new hands, so I liked him again? But then I found out those hands are bad! Can't trust politicians.
She's killing us on this hands thing.
Much like Ernest Contralto killed those innocent children after he pedophiled them, with those very hands.
Not helping! Your hands are being really aggressive right now.
Watch out! They're attacking your face! Hey, girl, whatcha working on? Getting some clicks? Get them clicks, girl.
Get.
Them.
Clicks.
I'm working on another big piece about how Jessica Biel is owned by private prison lobbyists, who want Oh, my Gaia, Diane, nobody cares.
I care and I don't even care.
So imagine how little someone who doesn't care cares.
Well What if you had lunch with her? Why would You could write about what she smells like, how she makes her face pretty.
These are things people will want to know about our first female governor.
Ugh! I'll have the avocado toast.
But instead of the avocado part, I want fresh sea air, and instead of the toast, I'll have a single grain of rice.
And for you? Grilled cheese? Thank you for meeting me here, Diane.
I just wanted to tell you, you can keep writing whatever you want about me.
Obviously, it has no effect on the polls, because the only thing voters care about is stupid bullshit, so knock yourself out.
Well, today I just want to know what you smell like.
It's actually my new fragrance: "Bielist," by Jessica Biel.
Your perfume's called "B"-list? "Bielist.
" "B"-list.
Like a "B"-list celebrity.
No, "Bielist" like Jessica Biel.
I think we're saying the same thing.
Do you want some? I got a whole trunk of this stuff.
No, thanks.
You sure? Mr.
Peanutbutter always loved the way I smelled.
Well, I wouldn't flatter yourself too much.
He's very enthusiastic about smelling in general.
He's enthusiastic about everything.
Oh, my God.
Does he still have that dumb magic eye poster? What? No.
When we were married, he was obsessed with it.
And he would make me stare at it for hours.
Yeah, I bet.
But then, all of a sudden, I saw it.
And it was incredible.
And I was so happy that I had waited long enough to experience this beautiful thing, and I felt so Why is this disgusting avocado on my plate? Oh, I I feel personally attacked right now.
Oh, so sorry.
Anyway, as I was saying about the poster, it's funny how something so stupid could have this tremendous power.
You know what I mean? Yeah.
I think I do.
A blog post about Jessica Biel is gaining attention for the seemingly minor detail that the candidate would not eat an avocado, calling the savory fruit, quote, "disgusting.
" Who doesn't like avocados? I don't know if Jessica Biel has the right judgment to lead California.
And I was totally convinced before, so it's really Whoa! the avocado thing that I have a problem with.
Why would you say that you hate avocados? I just have to live my truth, Katrina.
Her polls, like an avocado exposed to air, have quickly turned from a verdant green to a mushy brown.
And with only seven days until the election, her campaign might be in the pits.
Wow.
Who'da thunk that such a small trivial detail could be the thing to take Biel down? Yeah, who'da thunk it? Who knew? I knew.
I put the avocado thing in the story on purpose, I knew people wouldn't like it.
So just for the record, I "thunk" it.
Even though it doesn't matter.
I don't need credit.
But it does, if I didn't do that, it wouldn't have happened.
So, it's because of me.
Well, whoever is responsible Me.
I just told you.
We shouldn't get too excited just yet.
The election is a week away, and a lot can happen in a week.
This is far from over.
It's over.
And the clear winner is Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
All right! Huzzah! We did it! High five! Low five! Shadow puppet! Hand jive! Yes! We did it, didn't we? We did! You and me, working together, both contributing the same amount.
Well, I wrote the article that got Woodchuck elected governor.
You're the one that made him not governor in the first place.
I set 'em up.
You knock 'em down.
Thank you for meeting me here.
My name is Yolanda Buenaventura of the Better Business Bureau.
It would be funnier if your name was Betty Buenaventura of the Better Business Bureau.
Well, I'm sorry you don't find my name sufficiently comical, but this is actually a very serious matter.
Oh.
We've received complaints from several concerned parents.
It seems that many of your clown dentists aren't actually licensed to practice medicine.
Isn't laughter the best medicine? No.
It is the worst medicine.
If you can even call it medicine, which, legally, you cannot.
Well, what if I said my business was for entertainment purposes? That would require your employees to be entertaining.
According to your reviews on Yelp, your clown dentists are, quote, "A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian "invention that shakes one to the core.
" Ah, everyone's a critic.
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.
It appears your business provides no service but to terrify children and the adults who accompany them.
If this were October, you could market your venture as some sort of spooky Halloween experience, but since this is January, a month which, to my knowledge, contains no Halloweens, I have no choice but to Wait! Wait.
What if my clown dentists put on a show? A delightful, whimsical, non-terrifying clown-stravaganza? You would have to agree we were a legitimate business then, right? Go on.
Give us a week.
We'll put on a show.
If you don't laugh, I'll dissolve the business and release all my clown dentists into the woods, where they'll never bother anyone again.
All right.
You have one week to create a show that delights and astonishes me.
But I should warn you, I am a very tough crowd.
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party and I did not find him charming.
Ooh! Excuse me.
Get outta my way.
Like, hooked in a funny way.
You call that funny? That's not funny.
It's sad.
Well, some would argue that sad and funny are two sides of the same coin.
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln and some weird flat house are two sides of the same coin.
Take five, Picarello.
I've got a week to whip these dentists into clowns.
But they're just not silly or wacky or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind! Should you be drinking that? Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.
Might as well get blotto, right? Um, shouldn't you be at work? I'm recal-bibrating.
Oh! Ohh Hey, maybe you should Judah, look at my phone! Judah! You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.
Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.
What gal? So, you're a writer? Oh, actually that's a typo.
It should say "Waiter.
" But I'm an aspiring writer.
Uh-huh.
Sorry, that was a joke.
That's the kind of witty repartee you can expect from Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the business card.
Wait, ya know, I have this idea for a TV show.
Oh? It's a grizzled former detective who gets sucked back in This sounds fabulous.
Why don't you write a script, we'll go from there? I already wrote it.
Boom.
Oh, you brought it with you.
I don't trust email.
You know, the government.
Yeah.
Look, Flip, before I even read this, I should tell you that this town's a total crapshoot.
Odds of the right person finding your material and connecting with it are a million to One.
I just know I have this great potential inside me.
I know I can do it.
Even if no one else understands or believes in me.
I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but It's not stupid.
I believe in you.
I don't know how else to describe it other than this feeling of supreme warmth came over me, like this is what I've been waiting for my whole life.
That's amazing! Todd, the world is dark and scary and full of creepy clown dentists They're working very hard to be less creepy.
But when I hold this script in my hands, I have hope.
I gotta get this made.
What do I always say? "What's the difference between an agent and a manager?" Uh, managers are always talking about the differences between agents and managers and agents don't as much? No! Managers can produce! This script is a sign.
I gotta get off my ass and produce this baby.
Todd? Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.
Set something up with his gal.
Who is this gal? Okay.
Clentists, assemble! Wipe those serious looks off your faces and listen up! We gotta help Princess Carolyn, but also we gotta prep for our big show next week.
If only there was a way to do both at once.
What a ludicrous notion! Doctor Picarello, we might make a clown out of you yet! Oh, joy! Special delivery.
This next part is critical.
Remain wacky.
This is a highly frivolous situation! What's in the package? It's a hand delivery item.
Hey! Now, Doctor Boing Boing! I am in position.
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.
Whoa! before, so it's really the avocado thing that I have a problem with.
Target is acquired.
Deliver the goods, Doctor Boing Boing! Ah! It's sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-showtime! Whoa! Oh! Princess Carolyn! Lenny, thanks for making time.
Didn't realize I had.
Are you drunk? You smell like somebody tried to put out a fire at the booze factory with more booze.
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.
Now let's get to brass stacks.
So it's a hot young writer.
It's TV.
It's me producing.
"TV?" Just look at this script.
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.
Eh Know that website, "What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com," you go to when you want to know what time it is? Yeah.
They look to make a play in the gritty prestige streaming world, and it could make a big splash with a huge ad buy.
Plus, you got the built-in audience who don't know what time it is.
That's huge! That's so many people! Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect as their first series, but we'd have to get in fast.
They wanna premiere before Daylight Savings.
Let's set the pitch for next week.
Philbert? Who's Philbert? He's this grizzled but very good-looking detective who gets sucked back in to something.
No, I mean who is he? You got a star attached? Not yet, but Eh, we can't go in without a big name.
TV pitching is like the Israeli flag, it's nothing without a big star.
Sorry, Princess Carolyn.
No! Fish! Oh, whoa Ooh, spinny.
Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.
Don't let Turtletaub get back to his office.
This sounds like a job for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"! Doctor Picarello, you gotta revive Princess Carolyn.
Give her ten cc's of honka-honka.
Stat! Oh! Hey! Hey! Pardon me.
Excuse me! Oh! Allow me to lead, my lady.
Wow.
What the shell is this? So beautiful.
It says so much without saying anything at all.
You gotta be kidding me.
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart? He owes me a favor and he can disappear into any role.
Yeah, he can disappear so good, the audience disappears with him.
Tony Shalhoub! Tony Sha-who-ub? This is "What-time-isit-right-now-dot-com," not "What-time-is-it-fifteen-years-ago dot-Geocities-dot-comslash-Monk-fanpage.
" Please.
I need this so bad.
You don't understand.
This project is my Ba My Ba It's my baby.
Well, if you can't attach a real star, your baby's dead.
No! Oh, thank you.
There's gotta be a name that does something for you.
Uh, Jack Huston Hugh Hugh Jackman.
BoJack Horseman! There's someone Corbin Bernsen.
No.
Ben Mendelsohn.
No, no, no.
Hold on.
BoJack.
That's an idea.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
A BoJack-type.
I swore I'd never work with that asshole again, but you gotta admit he's got heat.
Star of Secretariat, disappears for a year, shows up again to do one episode of a reality show about butts.
Right, but And then you get him playing a rich, complex anti-hero like Philbert, now there's a show that screams, "What time is it right now?" Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.
I'm saying, there are a lotta guys P.
C.
, can you get me BoJack or not? Of course I can.
I'll send over a contract, iron-clad.
I don't want to risk that jerkwad skipping town again.
Make sure he signs it before the pitch.
Uh, will do.
And, uh, go easy on the sauce, huh, kid? Sloppy don't suit you.
Rubber chicken Rubber chicken Ah, I got that damn thing stuck in my head.
Guys, that was amazing! But if we're going to convince Yolanda we're ready for the big top, we need to really hunker down over the next week and put together a show so undeniably hilarious and life-affirming, that she has no choice but to say Wow! What a great show! Okay, you can keep your business Hooray! Perfect! is what I would say if you'd put on a good show.
Just so you understand the rubric when I declare my actual reaction, which is: "I did not enjoy that.
" Oh, no! My hooray was premature! So I must recommend that you dissolve this venture immediately.
All right, you heard the lady.
Get into the car, everyone.
I'm taking you to the woods, out by the old abandoned insane asylum, near the elementary school where you belong.
Hey, so I'm taking the rest of the day off.
What? Why? Just don't feel like working right now, so I think if I force it, I'm just gonna do a bad job.
Thank you, Stuart.
But I did want to remind you about that bitch meeting you have this afternoon at that clock website.
You mean the pitch meeting.
Pretty sure it said "bitch" meeting on the calendar.
Seemed a little harsh.
I could go double-check, but the calendar's all the way downstairs so No, Stuart.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What? Hey, BoJack, great news! Bad time.
Can't talk.
Wait, just listen for a Okay.
Here we go, baby.
Oh, man! You are not finding what you need! The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.
Hollyhock, you gotta get in here! Tina is drawing so many cards.
It's amazing.
Hollyhock! Hollyhock? Hollyhock? That's her name? Yes, for the third time, her name is "Hollyhock.
" And her last name? Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller Is there more? I think there's a Lopez in the mix somewhere? A Chung maybe? I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.
Okay, just any information you can give me on the 17-year-old horse girl who came here by ambulance 15 minutes ago would be of interest to my friend, Mr.
Franklin's friend, Mr.
Hamilton.
If you can't prove you're her parent or legal guardian, I can't release any information to you.
Guerrero! What? Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero Robinson Zilberschlag-HsungFonzarelli-McQuack.
That's her name.
And she's about five-eight.
And she's 17, her birthday is in September.
And She looks like me.
And she loves apples but hates apple sauce.
And she's funny.
But she isn't mean.
Which is pretty remarkable, 'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think you have to be mean to be funny, but Hollyhock is very sweet, even if she can be sarcastic.
But she has this smile with Does that help? No, man.
Are you her legal guardian? I'm not leaving here until I get to see her.
Have a seat.
Well, I don't like pedophile murderer hands, but I also don't like people talking trash about avocados.
This is a real head-scratcher for me.
I mean, what's next? The grief for every meal She'll be fine.
Huh? We have to think what's best for Hollyhock.
Hollyhock is going to be okay.
Excuse me.
Did you say Hollyhock? Are you Jose Guerrero.
Hello, yes! Yeah.
Thank God you're here.
I'm BoJack Horseman.
Yeah, we know.
I'm her dad, Steve Mannheim.
I'm the wrong Mannheim to mess with.
I'm Dashawn Manheim.
I'm probably the right Manheim to mess with, unless we're talking about a dance battle, in which case Five, six, seven, eight.
Ha! You've been warned.
Okay.
Yep.
Cupe Robinson III.
I think you're just ghastly, and I was against this whole caper from the bell.
Okay.
Otto Zilberschlag.
Uh, formerly a huge fan.
Now just a regular fan.
Got it.
I know of you, but not through your work.
Okay.
I'm Gregory Hsung.
I only watch foreign films.
That's my deal.
Arturo Fonzarelli, but I'm pretty cool so people call me the "Ice Man.
" And I'm Quackers! Quack, quack, quack! Easy, Quackers.
How's Hollyhock? They wouldn't give me information.
Why would they? You're not her dad.
No, I know.
I just Is she okay? She will be.
The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.
What happened? She overdosed.
What? No.
How could you let this happen? Quack, quack! Quackers! Settle down.
What was she on? I had no idea.
You had no idea? Have you looked at her? She's as thin as a pole.
You know I don't care for your Polish jokes, Dashawn.
She told us you were taking care of her.
I was.
I knew she was too young to be on her own like this.
She's a child! She called Pedro AlmodÃ³var's I'm So Excited "excessively kitsch.
" Kitsch is excessive! That's the point! Can I see her? Can I talk to her? You're lucky we don't call the police! Quack, quack.
Our kid got hooked on amphetamines because of you! No, I didn't Quack, quack, quack, quack.
Okay, I feel like there's a lot of male energy right now.
Why don't I come back in a couple hours? Give Hollyhock a chance to rest before I talk to her.
Are you insane? You are never seeing Hollyhock again.
Look, if I could just Never.
I have four grapefruits.
Okay.
Henrietta, would you like a grapefruit? I have but four, but I will share one with you, for I am kind and honest.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Where's the girl? She's gone, Mom.
Oh, yes, I took her, didn't I? Where did I put her? Oh, Henrietta, would you help me pack this? I want to bring it to my son.
Thanks, Mom.
It's for my son.
Right.
How did I not see it? All this time, I thought you were a terrible parent.
And you were.
But I blew it even worse.
It turns out being a parent is impossible, so I guess I can't be that mad at you.
Mad at me? No, Henrietta, this is the right thing.
You'll see.
Maybe we deserve each other.
Where is the girl? I made the girl coffee.
Jesus, you two and your coffee.
Wait.
No.
Oh! What did you put in this? That's an old family secret.
"Chub-B-Gone?" Takes the pounds right off.
This whole time.
Just until she learned to take it herself.
Of course it was you.
Henrietta! No.
All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am or-who-my-son-stuff" is, is officially not cute anymore.
You ruined the one good thing I had.
The one thing I didn't ruin myself, but of course I did because I thought it was a good idea to give you one more chance.
Where is Crackerjack? Stop.
You are out of chances.
What? Hey, BoJack, great news! Bad time.
Can't talk.
Wait, just listen Thank you for holding, Mr.
Horseman.
I understand you're interested in our facility and wanted our first available room.
No, I said "worst available room.
" FYI, we keep these blinds down because the window looks out at a Dumpster.
Noted.
You know You kick me a little coin right now, I can make sure your mother is very well taken care of.
Oh! In that case, please watch me not reach for my wallet.
Well, this is your life now.
This is what it all added up to.
You, by yourself, in this room.
Best of luck.
See ya never.
Who is that? Ugh.
Bye, Mom.
BoJack?
Slow down, Henrietta.
A lady mustn't rush.
It's unbecoming.
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son! My son is a ball of gas.
Yes! Your son, BoJack.
I'm him.
I'm the ball of gas! But you're also a star.
Wait.
Mom, do you remember Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.
Sun, you're a ball of gas, but you're also a star.
We call you "Sun.
" Ugh! Where are you taking me? Are we going to the lake house? No, we're going to a glorious magical place where they'll lock you in a room by yourself so you can't hurt anyone ever again.
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Why are you driving so slowly? Hurry up! Wait.
You just said Time's arrow neither stands still nor reverses, after all.
It merely marches forward.
Isn't that right, Henrietta? Yes, Mrs.
Horseman.
That's right.
Well, here we are.
Here? Yes.
Ugh! Halt! No entry.
But I wanna slide.
This is no mere slide.
We three are members of an elite society of extremely young women, led by I, Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.
You may not enter.
Yeah, and also you're fat.
Oh! I'm not fat.
Even your lungs expostulate as they struggle to expel your ample corpulence.
She's saying your lungs think you're fat too.
Father says I'm just growing.
If you do not halt, we will be forced to physically impede your egress.
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow! Beatrice, stop reading and put on your uniform.
Father, I don't feel well.
I don't care if you're scared of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle, you have to go to school.
Now stop making books your friends.
Reading does nothing for young women but build their brains, taking valuable resources away from their breasts and hips.
But my throat hurts.
Uniform! Now! Beatrice? Oh, my, you're hot.
Dear Lord.
Now listen here, it's a mother's duty to keep her children alive and you are continually failing! How could you not have known she has scarlet fever? Say something, damn it! What has become of you? I swear if I'd known this is how you'd behave once we severed the connections to your prefrontal cortex, I'd hardly have bothered.
Father? Yes, darling? Am I to die? Well, eventually yes, but this illness is but a hiccup in what will be a long and happy life, I promise.
You promise? In fact, some good may yet come of this.
Doctor says your throat is nearly swollen shut.
So perhaps you'll finally lose some of that weight that's given you such troubles.
Won't that be nice? Yes, Father.
Ow! Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.
Polly, be a darling and fetch me a pretty pill and a glass of water, won't you? Yes, SeÃ±orita Sugarman.
Beatrice, you're looking well, which is just fine, because your debutante party is vitally important.
Will it end poverty, war and injustice, or bring back civil rights activist Medgar Evers, who was shot in Mississippi this week? Yes! Or rather, it will end you worrying about that nonsense because it will land you a husband.
At least Evers' death means no one else will be assassinated this year, 1963.
The FBI is on too high alert to allow anything like that to happen again.
Hmm? Yes well Your chaperone, Corbin Creamerman, is a fine young man.
Oh, Jeez.
My lady.
Here you go.
Thanks.
So uh, you look nice.
Thank you, Corbin.
That's the third time you've told me.
You needn't tell me again.
Oh, Jeez.
I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at these things.
But sometimes I am.
I can be.
I I really try to be.
I'm, well, I I'm not.
I'm really not.
I don't know why.
Ah, that's all right.
I'm not either.
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman, is founder of Creamerman's Creamy Cream-based Commodities.
Think of all the free iced cream you could, uh, serve to other people.
Father, do you aim to marry me off to Corbin Creamerman merely because it would be good for business? Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas of how a Sugarman/Creamerman alliance might be advantageous.
Uh-huh.
For example, imagine a television advertisement with a fun jingle.
Have your morning coffee or tea With Sugarman and Creamerman But save some for these fellas And then it's Mort and me, and we're holding up our products with big smiles from across a very ordinary looking kitchen table.
Father, common Americans don't want you on their TV sets.
You're a reminder of the disparity of wealth in this country.
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.
You know, I sent you to Barnard to get your MRS from a fine upstanding Columbia man, but instead of a bachelor you returned home with a bachelor's degree and a mouth full of sass.
What a waste! You look nice.
Thank you.
Oh, my Beatrice Sugarman? Doth my eye belie me? Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.
Why are you here? I must say, it's tremendous you're finally debuting.
Better late than never, hmm? Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father, who has very old-fashioned ideas about how a woman is to live her life.
Poor Corbin here is saddled with chaperoning me.
Oh, I don't feel saddled.
In truth, I find these parties to be garish, self-serving wastes of money.
Oh, and I'm sure yours was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.
Oh, my! How repugnant! Uh Scotch on the rocks.
Do I know you? Nope, just crashing some dumb debutante's party.
Oh, do you mean for "dumb" to describe the party or the debutante? Because I might agree with you, or I might be offended.
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you? Beatrice Sugarman.
Welcome to my dumb party.
Butterscotch Horseman.
Charmed, I'm sure.
You crash a lot of these? I'll take my free alcohol where I can get it.
Saving for California.
What's in California? Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.
This is where you ask me if those are towns, and I smirk at you.
I am familiar with the Beats, thank you.
I like Ginsberg all right, but if you ask me, that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.
What's your interest in them? What's my interest? They're the greatest minds of our generation.
I'm heading west to join them, because I'm one of the greatest minds too.
I see.
You will see.
I'm writing the next Great American Novel.
Oh, what's it about? It's about truth! It's about war! It's about the twilighting frontier of the lives that were promised us.
But what is it about? Who are the characters? I never claimed to have the whole thing sorted out just yet, did I? Sounds like a best seller.
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing for a woman to be.
I don't know how you expect to nab a husband at a party like this with a personality like that.
Oh, congratulations.
You and my father express the same concerns.
If I were your old man, I'd be anxious to get you married off, too.
I bet your thank-you letters are perfunctory, your flower arrangements are uninspired, and your curtsy is an embarrassment.
Looks like you pegged me as well as I pegged you.
What must your mother think of you? Oh, she doesn't think much About anything, anymore.
Oh.
I'm sorry, did did she pass? No, not exactly.
Mine did.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I was little.
I don't remember, really.
But she had a diamond just like yours.
I saw it in a picture once.
Oh Yes, this is my mother.
What? I'd like to leave her here.
Can I pay for the next five years now so I don't have to think about her again? Wha Oh.
Oh, jeez, I I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have to do the thing now, where we do the things.
Oh oh, right.
Um Please excuse me.
Of course, it sounds very important.
Mr.
and Mrs.
Joseph Sugarman present their daughter, Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.
Chaperoned by Mr.
Corbin C.
Creamerman.
Look at her go, folks.
Clearing every hurdle.
Look at that form.
What precise movements.
Five, six Beautiful trot.
Truly outstanding.
A lovely lady indeed.
Ta-da! Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Oh Excuse me.
Don't you know it's rude to leave without saying goodbye to the hostess? Why don't you come with me? It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes, thus eliminating my transgression.
Oh! You want me to leave my own party with you? The low-life who wasn't even invited? Yeah.
But I suppose Daddy wouldn't like that, would he? Oh, Beatrice.
I have wonderful news.
I'm reading.
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.
He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.
I am not interested in Corbin Creamerman.
I don't give a damn where your interests lie! After the disappearing act you pulled at your own party, you're lucky I don't fill a jar with jellied beans and marry you off to the man who can closest estimate the amount.
Heavens! Corbin Creamerman is willing to give you a second chance, he is downstairs waiting, and you will be civil to him.
And the way they make non-dairy creamer is by replacing the milk fat with vegetable oil.
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.
Pretty nifty, huh? Is that so? Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.
Not at all.
I don't find you boring.
Only the things you choose to talk about, and the way in which you talk about them.
Oh, I I'm sorry.
I I just get excited by food chemistry.
You know, you take something you thought you knew, and then discover there's so much more to it than you could have possibly imagined.
It's like Magic.
Oh? My father is less enchanted.
He says it's just squeezing money out of cow teats.
I suppose that's true, but I got ideas too, and I feel I never get to be anything other than what he expects me to be.
You know what that's like? I do.
You know, Corbin, it occurs to me that perhaps you and I aren't so Oh, dear! Nice gams.
Nice gams.
Is that the only thing you can think of to say? Nice Gams.
Uh Beatrice, what are you doing here? I had to look you up in the phone book.
The number you gave me was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.
What? Are you sure? Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.
Wha Whoa, boy! Come on, Bopper, can you give us some privacy, please? Sure thing, Butterscotch.
You take it easy.
Are you certain it's mine? Well, whose else could it be? What do you wanna do? Maybe you have a cousin, who has a a friend, who knows a doctor, who can take care of such inconveniences? I'm I'm happy to do the gentlemanly thing and and pay for the cab fare.
No.
I can't.
Well, that doesn't leave us with very many options.
I'm a ruined woman.
Don't be hysterical.
You're not ruined.
It's a verifiable fact you look more beautiful than ever.
Oh, what do you know? It was a pretty great night we had together, huh? It was.
Say, did you ever hear the story of the couple who moved to California? I can't say that I have.
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.
You see, they hardly knew each other, but they shared a certain sensitivity and a taste for the unknown.
They were living in a one-horse town, so they headed west, towards a town that could accommodate three horses.
Oh, yes, I think I have heard this story.
They got a small house in San Francisco near the bookstore.
He got in good with Squirrelinghetti and his scurry.
He wrote his Great American Novel While his wife took care of the baby.
His wife? Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.
Well, if she'd have him.
If a beautiful creature like herself could ever love an oaf like him.
I think she could.
Yeah? And isn't that how the story goes? Come on, come on, come on.
Sleep.
The baby's hungry.
I tried.
He won't eat.
I don't know what he wants.
Well, can you figure it out? If I don't sleep, how can I work to support you and the child, let alone have energy left over to write? Maybe if anyone wanted to pay you for anything you wrote, we'd be able to afford a nanny and a maid.
Well, if Squirrelinghetti and his horde of commie, liberal, Jew-loving rejects knew what good writing was, I'd be able to sell something.
Oh, so they're all wrong, and you're right.
Why won't you just take that corner office job at Sugarman West instead of breaking your back all day at the cannery, and then maybe you could afford me some decent help around here? You want me to work for your father, and get paid for it, like some sort of slave? That is the opposite of slavery.
Is it? Yes, it is! You have no facility for language.
Oh, will you at long last be quiet? You wanted that baby.
Never forget that.
I need quiet! You'd better be worth all this.
Well, you're not.
I'm not what? Mommy's tired, BoJack.
Tell me a story.
Oh, once upon a time Quiet.
Your father's home.
How was work, darling? Ugh! Terrible.
Those fish do not like being canned.
Well, I burnt dinner, again.
But you can pick at the charred remains and delight me and your simple son God.
with stories of your noble, salt-of-the-earth co-workers like Eight-Finger Joe and Sports-Team Steve Oh, God.
before locking yourself in your study for the night Know what? to chip away at your never-ending goddamn novel.
I'll clean up the kitchen, and bathe our filthy child.
If you could just And we'll just keep waltzing through this goddamn Would you proletariat dream.
No Maybe if the goddamn baby wasn't crying all the time, I could finish the goddamn novel.
I'm not a baby.
I'm six.
Yes, wah, wah, Ga, Ga, goo, goo.
I'm forming sentences.
Oh, and I can't? Everyone's a critic.
I can see the headline now, "Idiot Son Thinks Dad's Book is "Great, comma, Son is Idiot.
" I didn't say your book is great.
I can't live like this! I should have married Corbin Creamerman.
Ha! Like he'd have you.
Oh, he would have.
And he would have been kind to me.
And he wouldn't have been too much of a stubborn ass to take a decent job at my father's company! Fine! I'll take the corner office, with the company car, six-figure salary, and four weeks paid vacation, but if my novel becomes bad because I no longer remember what it's like to be working class, we'll know of whom to be blamed.
Oh.
A little to the left.
Good choice.
Just over Careful with that.
That looks great.
Hello? You're always in the way.
Why don't you go play? Okay.
Go do something.
Bye, Mom.
You are fired.
Vacuum.
Thank you.
Stat.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Henrietta, will you help me pack this? I want to bring it to my son.
Oh, that's so nice.
I love a good painting.
It's like TV without all the talking and movement.
Jesus, what is that ghastly thing? It belonged to Father.
I'm giving it to BoJack.
I never cared for the aesthetic arts.
Dulls the senses.
Art should be straightforward and utilitarian, like my novel.
I can't wait to read it.
Books are fantastic.
The words tell stories.
Henrietta, the painting.
Right away, Mrs.
Horseman.
I shouldn't have to ask you twice.
God gave you two ears and me only the one mouth, after all.
You could be nicer to her.
No one's ever nice to me.
Why should I be nice? Beatrice Just because the maid bats her little eyes at you and makes barely-qualifyingfor-conversation conversation, doesn't mean I'm so easily seduced.
I don't know what you're insinuating.
I Oh, I'm sure she makes you feel like a big smart man, never challenges you, and thanks you for helping her study for nursing school.
As a matter of fact, she is studying for nursing.
I know.
I can hear your flirting through the wall, when you're supposedly "working on your novel.
" I bet you think she's falling in love with you.
You sensitive, misunderstood artist.
Ugh.
Won't she be disappointed.
I don't know why you don't just get a divorce already.
Oh, sure, that's the Hollywood way.
"We're out of mustard.
Let's get a divorce!" "I'm a little sad.
Divorce!" "We've grown apart over the years" and our adult child has moved out of the house "and there's no reason for us to stay together.
Divorce!" That actually is a legitimate reason to get a divorce.
Well, who else would have me now? After what you did to my body? What I did? Anyway, do you want this painting? It belonged to your grandfather, a man who knew what marriage meant.
Sure.
I drove it all the way down here, didn't I? You might as well take it.
I said I'll take it.
Of course.
Take.
That's all you ever do.
How long you sticking around for, Mom? Just pour me a drink and I'll be on my way.
Yeah, let's get you good and liquored up before you drive up the coast.
I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.
She was the good one? I always get them confused.
I heard your show was canceled.
Three years ago now.
You're really on the pulse, huh? I never understood the appeal.
It's just a bunch of silly stories.
Some people like silly stories.
Lotta good they ever did me.
It's not Ibsen, but It would only depress me to watch you bumble around like that.
All the sacrifices I made, so that you could do this.
Thanks for the painting.
It'll be nice to have something that always reminds me of this conversation.
Uh, Beatrice.
What? I, uh I gummed things up.
Oh? It's Henrietta.
The girl went and got herself pregnant.
Oh, she got herself pregnant? Can you talk to her? Just woman to woman? She wants to have the baby.
I I can't talk her out of it.
What do you want me to say? I'm out of options, Bea.
You think I enjoy groveling to my own wife, hat in hand? If you weren't so neglectful in your wifely duties Don't you dare.
I'm sorry.
What do I don't know what to do.
I Please.
Just just fix this for me, please.
I know you hate me, Bea, but please just think of the poor girl.
Oh, God.
You're fired, of course.
I'm so sorry, Mrs.
Horseman.
He was just so kind to me and I felt so Let me guess, he said you reminded him of his dead mother.
He said she had hair like mine.
He saw it in a picture once.
Do you really want this child? I I think so? It's a baby horse.
A girl.
I need help.
I'm studying to be a nurse, and tuition keeps going up.
None of that is my fault.
If I can just finish school and get a job, it'll be okay.
And who's going to care for the baby while you work? Because God knows he won't.
Well, don't do that.
What does that solve? I don't know what else to do, Mrs.
Horseman.
All right.
We'll pay for your tuition.
Really? Yes.
And you'll give the baby up for adoption.
No.
You think you want this, but you don't.
Not like this.
Mrs.
Horseman Don't throw away your dreams for this child.
Don't let that man poison your life the way he did mine.
You are going to finish your schooling and become a nurse.
You'll meet a man, a good man, and you'll have a family, but please believe me, you don't want this.
Oh Please, Henrietta, you have to believe me.
Please, don't do what I did.
Mm-hmm.
My My baby! Where's my baby? Oh, look at you.
You did it, Henrietta.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no.
No, please.
Please don't.
Stop.
Stop! Why are you doing this? Beatrice, remember what we say about crying? Mm-hmm.
Crying is stupid.
But, Father, tell them not to burn my things.
But, darling, they have to.
Your sickness has infected everything.
The hard part is over.
Wait.
Wait.
I wanna hold her.
No.
You'll get attached.
Wait! It all must be destroyed for your own good.
I need to hold her.
This is for your own good.
But not my baby.
Yes.
Especially your baby.
Whoop! See, doesn't that feel better? No! My baby! Wait, please.
I need to hold her.
No, no.
Wait.
No, please come back.
I need to hold her.
Please.
No! Come on now, be strong.
You can't let your womanly emotions consume you.
You don't wanna end up like your mother now, do you? No.
I promise.
One day this will all be a pleasant memory.
Best of luck.
See ya never.
Who is that? Bye, Mom.
BoJack? Mom? BoJack? Is that you? Yeah, it's me.
Well, oh, what is this place? This is where you live now.
No.
Is it? No.
Mom Where are we, BoJack? I just told you.
I don't understand.
Where Where am I? You're In Michigan.
Michigan? Yeah.
At the lake house.
I am? It's a It's a warm summer night, and the fireflies are dancing in the sky.
And your whole family is here.
And they're telling you that everything is gonna be all right.
Yes.
That's right.
What else? The crickets are are chirping, and the lake is still, and the night is full of stars.
I can see it.
It's so clear.
What are we doing here, BoJack? We're sitting on the back porch, and we're listening to your brother play the piano, and we're eating ice cream.
Vanilla ice cream.
Yes.
That's right.
Oh, it's all so marvelous.
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom? Oh, BoJack.
It's so Delicious.
I got into this business because I love stories.
They comfort us, they inspire us, they create a context for how we experience the world.
But also, you have to be careful, because if you spend a lot of time with stories, you start to believe that life is just stories, and it's not.
Life is life, and that's so sad, because there's so little time and What are we doing with it? [CLOCKS TICKING.]
Thank you.
When Princess Carolyn told me we were pitching to whattimeisitrightnow.
com, I was excited, because in so many ways, the story I'm about to tell is about time.
And it's about time this story was told.
Ooh! Ahh! [FLIP.]
It's about Detective John Philbert, a man from another time.
[SIGHS.]
[FLIP.]
But now he finds himself in a new time.
I'm sorry, did you say newt time? No, no, new time.
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts? No.
Unless you want it to be a time full of newts.
No, no, no, no.
I'm just clarifying.
Okay.
He finds himself in a time he doesn't understand.
[SIGHS.]
[PHONE DIALING.]
[MAN.]
Don't call this number again.
Wait.
I I just My mother, she's senile, and she was drugging the coffee.
That's why Just I wanted you to know that none of this was Hollyhock's fault.
[MAN.]
Goodbye, BoJack.
[FLIP.]
A time in which he is alone.
Perhaps, all this time, he's been alone.
Except for the newts, right? Hmm.
Yeah.
Except for the newts.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING.]
And then it dawns on him, his partner isn't a ghost.
Or is he? Wow! As we like to say here, there are little hand ideas and big hand ideas.
And that's a big hand idea.
And you said BoJack Horseman is attached? What? Oh, yeah.
BoJack is attached.
But he's not like "attached" attached.
If you want us to get somebody better Oh, no, no, no.
We love BoJack.
Yeah.
We don't wanna do this without BoJack, just to be clear.
Well Oh, he's definitely attached.
He signed a contract.
I saw it myself.
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah.
[GULPS.]
So if you look to the left, you'll see a charming little breakfast nook.
Oh! [GASPS.]
Look at that! But if you want more natural light, you could knock down that wall and put in these French doors! That is so cool! You actually don't have to yell.
Wait, Diane.
Are we in the same house right now? I don't see you.
I can hear you.
I think we're close! You can't see each other in the program.
So I'm invisible? Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost? Of a Union soldier, perhaps, who cannot rest until his final letter is delivered! And can I be Anne of Green Gables? No, you're both still you.
Diane, can I talk to you alone for a moment? Oh, I can step out Sure! Why don't you meet me in the guest bathroom? Ow! You don't have to.
Where's Hold on.
I think Guys, I can just Here we are.
Diane? No.
Careful.
Okay.
Do you really love this house? Yeah, it's fine.
I didn't love the old house, but it was your house and I moved in, and it was great.
But this is an opportunity to build something together.
Something that'll last for the rest of our lives.
Anything you want is gonna be good with me.
Just like your old house.
But I don't want this to just be another one of my houses.
I want this to be our house.
And it will be, because we'll both be living in it.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I don't need anything fancy.
All that matters to me is that I get to live with you.
In the real world.
Oh! No more campaign, no more ex-wives.
Just Diane and Mr.
Peanutbutter, back to normal.
For the rest of our lives.
That sounds great.
We'll take it.
One second, though, I have to use the bathroom.
No, no, no, that's not You completely humiliated me in front of Sha Na Na! [THE HORSE.]
How was I supposed to Sha Na know they were going to invite me on the stage to do a guitar solo? [SABRINA.]
You're supposed to be my dad.
You're supposed to be looking out for me.
[GROANS.]
[SABRINA.]
You're the worst dad in the world! [THE HORSE.]
Well, too bad I'm the only dad you got.
[SABRINA GRUNTS.]
[DOORBELL CHIMES.]
[BOTH.]
Huh? [THE HORSE.]
O.
J.
Simpson lawyer and DNA expert Barry Scheck? [SCHECK.]
My car broke down.
[SABRINA.]
What? [SCHECK.]
I guess it ran out of juice.
Hi.
Yeah, my mom is a resident.
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.
Don't put me on hold.
Just take a message [SABRINA.]
Wait, wait! You're a DNA expert? Could I use DNA to find my real family? [SCHECK.]
Well, sometimes, DNA can be a tricky thing.
Like, for example, was Simpson DNA found at the scene of the murder of Nicole Brown? Sure.
Was it O.
J.
Simpson's DNA? Who's to say? Oh.
Maybe it was some other Simpson, like his son, or his father.
There's no way to know.
I wouldn't worry about it.
That's too much, man [DOORBELL CHIMES.]
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Uh-oh.
She had a long day of drinking.
I figured she shouldn't drive herself home.
Good thinking.
Yeah.
I was right too, because she crashed her car.
What? I probably should've said something, but You need to get your shit together.
Wha Where am I? Okay, so you know how you're always giving pep talks to people, telling them they need to get their shit together? Well, this is me giving you the Princess Carolyn pep talk.
Why am I tied up in the woods? So you can't escape my wise words.
Is that not part of it? I couldn't remember.
It doesn't matter.
It's all over for me.
When it gets out I faked BoJack's signature, the deal's gonna fall apart.
There goes my reputation, my career Well, there's more to life than just your career, isn't there? Is there? Isn't there? I have nothing! Oh! This pep talk is going in the wrong direction.
Do you know how hard it is to start a family at my age? To find a guy at my age? You don't need a guy to start a family.
You're Princess Carolyn.
You can do anything.
No, I can't.
Look, the woods are dark and scary, but the only way out is through.
I'm sorry.
I got distracted by the woods.
Um, what were we talking about? No, you're right.
The only way out is through.
I gotta talk to BoJack.
I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.
I'm Princess Carolyn.
That's the spirit! As my blood type always says, "B" positive! What was that? I don't know.
Oh! Oh! Hey, Doctor Picarello.
[GROANING.]
Doctor Picarello, are you okay? [GROWLING.]
Todd? [ALL SNARLING.]
[DRILL WHIRRING.]
So it turns out Vice Chancellor Laughing Gassy got rabies from quarrelling with an old raccoon.
And then he started biting everyone, and now a bunch of them have rabies.
Who could have predicted my innocent clown dentist venture could turn into something so terrifying? I don't see how this concerns me.
Yolanda, the only reason they're in the woods at all is because of you.
If people find out the Better Business Bureau is behind this, you don't think you'll be getting a buzz from the Business Branch of the Board of Better Bureaus? You're right! We have to do something before someone gets hurt.
Call me four out of five dentists, because I agree.
What? Here we are.
The rest of our lives.
Yeah, wow.
Do you wanna go to Hawaii? What? Right now? Yeah! When's the last time we did something impulsive? Well, you did run for governor without giving it much I just think we could use a vacation.
Things have been so crazy this last year.
Before we start the rest of our lives, haven't we earned a break? All right.
Let's go to Hawaii! They got that bridge that's just sitting there.
We might as well use it.
All right! Hawaii, here we come! All right! Hawaii! Hawaii! [HORNS HONKING.]
[DIANE.]
Oh.
[MR.
PEANUTBUTTER SIGHS.]
[GULLS SQUAWKING.]
So, listen.
As you know, one of the differences between agents and managers Oh, my God.
Stop.
Please stop.
I'm producing a new TV show.
It's a phenomenal script which may or may not involve ghost or newts.
Does it involve ghost or newts? It may! You haven't read it, have you? Read it? I'm producing it! Right.
It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.
Right, well They're impossible to figure out.
Then all of a sudden, some random detail makes the hero remember a conversation that totally re-contextualizes everything, and then it all magically comes together.
Sure, but It's such bullshit.
Where's my random detail that's gonna suddenly make everything make sense? Because I would love that.
Well, this script is really special, and everyone wants to play the lead, from Matthew McConaughey to Matthew Perry.
Matthew Perry? Yeah.
But I was thinking Hold on.
Matthew Perry Hey, BoJack, which one of these pictures more says, "This daughter looks like a cool "lady that I wanna have in my life"? Why do you ask? I'm writing a letter to my mom and I want to include a picture.
I'm going to send it to the adoption agency.
Maybe if they still have her address on file, they can forward it to her.
Seems like a long shot.
How about a better strategy is, don't do that, and then you won't be disappointed when it doesn't work out? I'm trying everything.
I don't wanna look back at this and feel like the end of "Chandler's List," you know? You mean "Schindler's List".
Never saw it.
I'm talking about "Chandler's List," the sketch from when Matthew Perry hosted SNL.
Remind me? Okay.
So it's Chandler from "Friends", and it's World War II, and he's got this list.
And the whole time, he's like, "I'm Chandler! "Could I have a bigger list?" But then at the end, the war's over, and he's like "Could I have had a bigger list?" Whoa.
He's haunted because he feels like he could have done more.
You know, he's like, "Could I be any more "feeling like I could have done more?" I have to go.
Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here! [GROANS.]
[DOOR SLAMS.]
[PANTING.]
Oh.
[GASPS.]
Huh.
Huh? [SNARLING.]
[MUSIC PLAYING.]
Shh! Yes.
Get the magazine.
What a fine addition to your waiting room.
Oh, no! [DRILL WHIRRS.]
[MUSIC PLAYING AT FASTER TEMPO.]
[SCREAMING.]
[DRILL WHIRRING.]
[GRUNTING, GROANING.]
Oh, God.
[CLOWN GROWLING.]
What are we gonna do, Todd? Guys, let's talk this out.
[DRILL WHIRRING.]
[HORN HONKING.]
Run.
Ouchie! Ouchie! [BOTH PANTING.]
Oh, man.
I've never run that fast in my life.
Me neither.
I gotta get in better shape.
I keep saying I'm gonna run more, but it's just so hard to stay motivated.
Hmm.
Don't "hmm.
" I'm talking to you.
[HORNS HONKING.]
[TIRES SCREECHING.]
Can you not start and stop so much? I can't control the traffic, darling.
When the car in front of me starts, I start.
And when it stops, I stop.
Maybe you don't have to start every time the car in front of you starts, because you know it's gonna stop again anyway.
You could leave a little space.
Okay.
[ENGINE RUMBLES.]
And another car just cut in front of me because I left a little space.
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.
Okay.
I'm gonna get some gas.
All right.
I got the lowdown.
First of all, very important, I got you this flattened penny.
I will cherish it always.
I'm sorry for being annoying before.
Don't worry about it.
Here's the deal.
With this traffic, we can stay on our current trajectory and get to Hawaii just in time to spend two luxurious hours at the Honolulu Stilton, and then turn around and come back, or we can hang out here at the Thrifty Lodge at this charming halfway to Hawaii rest area and gas park.
Excuse me, we would like your finest room, please.
All our rooms are the same.
What kind of cuisine is on premises? There's a deli at the gas station across the street.
And what are your spa hours? There's no spa.
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala, could I use your grand ballroom for that, or is that booked months in advance? I could settle for a Demi-ballroom in a pinch, but attire will be formal, I don't wanna upstage the venue.
We have zero ballrooms in this Thrifty Lodge.
I see.
This will do nicely.
Didn't you tell me once you always wanted a ballroom? Actually, no.
[CHUCKLES.]
What I wanted was a Belle-room.
What is that? Like a room full of bells? It's a room full of big books, with big windows and a ladder, like Belle got in "Beauty and the Beast".
And it's called a Belle-room? It's called a library.
But I called it a Belle-room because it was magical.
And since it was a name I made up for a room that wasn't real, that meant that it was just mine.
That's adora-Belle.
[WOMAN.]
Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn! What's that? You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right? Ha! That's right.
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie? That's like a shellfish version of a selfie.
Hmm? Go, take a picture.
It'll make their day.
You sure? You don't mind? I'll be in the room.
Don't stay out with your new friends too late.
Hey, guys.
I'm coming down.
What other of my things do you like? [MAN.]
Wow, yeah! Okay, so [SNORING.]
Oh.
Hey.
[JOSE.]
So the supplier said, "I really oughta give Iowa a try.
" But I said, "Buddy, Kansas City's about as far as I can go.
" Long story short, we're meeting in St.
Louis.
[POUNDING ON DOOR.]
Huh? Hey! I need to talk to Hollyhock! She's not here.
You have to let me see her.
Please, I flew all the way here and it's Wichita, so it's not like I got other shit to do in Wichita.
No one told you to come here.
You're the one who likes foreign movies, right? That part in "Amelie", where she listens to the guy's story? This is that part.
And I'm the guy with the story.
And I need you to be Amelie right now.
I don't like foreign movies.
I like foreign films.
Okay, you're impossible.
The rest of you, please, just listen for a second.
I know you hate me.
But for Hollyhock, please, listen.
[CLEARS THROAT.]
Whole time she's staying with me, it doesn't make sense, right? If I'm her father, where is her mother? Well, that's an extremely heteronormative way of looking at things.
No, I'm saying, medically, where is the woman I had sex with that made her be born? Right? That's why Hollyhock came to L.
A.
in the first place.
Okay But then I thought, "What if I'm not her father?" You're not her father.
We are her fathers.
You're her fathers.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Eight of you, each have your own cute thing, I get it.
My point is, Hollyhock and I have the same DNA, but that doesn't mean I'm her father.
You're not.
Because being a father isn't just God, I feel like you are willfully misunderstanding me.
What I am saying is, I'm not even her father biologically.
Excuse me? My father is her father.
What? Huh? [BOJACK.]
I went to every hospital and clerk house in L.
A.
I waited in lines, filled out forms, talked to anyone who would talk to me.
I wouldn't rest until I knew I'd done everything I could.
But there was no record of a little horse girl born on Hollyhock's birthday Okay, so? in L.
A.
, because Hollyhock wasn't born in L.
A.
She was born in San Francisco.
I got a little bug in my brain that my father knocked up the help.
So I went up there, and I did the whole thing again, and I found it.
The birth certificate with her mother's name, clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.
That's But where is she now, right? Looked her up on Facebook.
I know what you think: "BoJack Horseman has a Facebook account?" Obviously, I didn't, because the Internet is for nerds.
But I know it's a good way to find people, so I set up an account, and I found her.
She lives in Minneapolis.
She's a nurse.
Her phone number was on her Facebook page.
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.
You did all that? She has to know.
You don't have to tell her I was here.
I'll stay out of her life forever.
You can tell her I'm an asshole.
Say you found this on your own.
I don't care, but you have to tell her.
Please.
Whittagut dittagoo yittagoo gittaguys thittagink? Hittagollittagy-hittagock's stittagill frittagail.
Guys Littaget's jittagust tittagell hittagim whittagut hittagee wittagants tittagoo hittageer.
All right, BoJack.
We'll tell her.
Yeah? Yeah.
But you need to leave.
Right now.
[SIGHS.]
Okay.
Welcome to the best workout routine in L.
A.
Nothing motivates like fear.
So remember, once you're in there, don't stop running.
If the clown dentists catch you, they will bite you, and they have very healthy teeth.
[CHUCKLES.]
Okay, but not really, right? Nope, really.
They will actually bite you, and they do actually have rabies.
Wow, guess I'm gonna really have to run.
No more excuses.
This is great.
Exactly! And don't forget Have fun in there! [WOMAN.]
Whoo-hoo! [MAN.]
Let's do this.
[MAN 2.]
Let's go.
[ALL SCREAMING.]
Well, you did it.
You made a better business.
We did it.
Between your no-nonsense approach and my the-regular-amountof-nonsense approach, we make a pretty good team.
Yes.
I'm going back to my job.
But if anything happens here and you need me, or if you just wanna hang out again, grab a drink, you should call me sometime.
Oh, um, I should tell you, I'm actually asexual.
Yeah, I know.
So am I.
That's why I'm asking you out.
Oh! Uh, okay.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Huh.
[DOORBELL CHIMES, WHINNIES.]
I have to talk to you.
Make yourself at home.
I screwed up.
I'm sorry.
I promised you'd do this show.
I don't know why.
I just I needed something I'll do it.
What? You want me to do it, I'll do it.
God knows you've done enough for me.
[GROANS.]
What's wrong? I said I'd do it.
It's just really hard to need people.
Yeah, but Yeah.
Thank you.
Eh, it'll be good for me to get out of the house anyway.
You want a drink? Water.
Water? "Water" you pregnant? [CHUCKLES.]
Very much not so.
I heard you got a new boyfriend.
We broke up.
Oh.
Sounds like an asshole.
He was actually the first guy I ever dated who wasn't an asshole.
Well, onwards and upwards.
I heard you had a kid living with you? No.
She's got these adopted dads.
They're total dicks, but they take care of her.
She'll have a good life.
Oh.
You ever think of adopting? [SIGHS.]
More and more lately.
You should.
You'd be a good mom.
The world needs good moms.
I'll take that under advisement.
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.
I'm looking forward to it.
Now, back to normal.
Diane and Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Here we are.
The rest of our lives.
I wanna show you something.
I had the contractor put this together while we were gone.
Close your eyes.
[DIANE.]
Okay All right.
Open them.
Oh, my God! It's Pretty cool, huh? Why would you do this? It's what you always wanted, right? It's too much.
I didn't want it like this.
Like what? I don't know.
I'm sorry.
This is great.
I'm sorry.
Why would you think I would like this? Because you told me this is what you always dreamed of? I don't like big gestures like this! How many times have I? Yeah, but this is This was a fantasy, something that belonged to me.
Why couldn't you have asked me I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I ever try to surprise you, or do nice things.
Do you know how much it cost to get 5,000 fake books? So I'm the bitch? Is that what you I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home feel like a place that you would want to live that could be yours as well as mine! Why is that so important to you? Because otherwise, it feels like you're a guest.
And unlike the talking candlestick in the aforementioned Disney film, I don't want you to be that.
It makes me feel shitty.
Like you're just visiting here, until the next thing and you're gonna leave me when you get bored or you find something better.
Like Katrina did.
Like Jessica did.
You can't use your ex-wives against me.
I'm just telling you how I feel.
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.
This is not how I thought this would go at all.
[SIGHS.]
Diane and Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Back to normal, right? [CHUCKLES.]
You know, sometimes I feel like our marriage is like a magic eye poster.
I love those things.
I know.
And it's messy.
And at first glance, it doesn't seem to make any sense.
And it's hard to figure out.
But sometimes, if you squint at it just right, everything lines up, and it's the most perfect Beautiful, amazing thing.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
But [VOICE BREAKS.]
I'm so tired of squinting.
[CRYING.]
Oh What? Oh, Christ.
[RINGTONE CHIMING.]
Hollyhock.
Hi.
How are you? Listen I wanted to thank you for finding my mom.
They told you? Not exactly.
They have this secret dad language they think I don't understand, but it's super obvious what they're saying.
[CHUCKLES.]
You're too smart for your own good.
So, yeah, I've been talking to Henrietta on the phone and she seems really nice.
Really? Wow! I'm gonna visit her in Minneapolis.
I'm at the airport right now.
Right now? That's incredible.
No, what's incredible is this place at the airport charged me ten dollars for a cup of fruit.
What? And get this.
It's like 90 percent honeydew.
Are you kidding me? Why? What on-the-go jet-setter's demanding more honeydew in his or her fruit cup? Nobody ever wants honeydew, it's always there.
It is literally the worst part of everything it's in.
It's like the Jared Leto of fruits.
Thank you.
Exactly.
Mmm.
Well Anyway, they're about to start boarding, so Hollyhock, I'm sorry I didn't take better care of you.
I shouldn't have moved in with you.
It was maybe too much too fast.
Yeah.
But it wasn't all bad.
I mean, yeah, I got secretly drugged for months on end to the point I was living in a nightmare which I couldn't recognize my own body or understand what was happening to my brain, but, other than that, it was a pretty chill experience.
I should have protected you.
I really wanted to be a good dad to you, Hollyhock.
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.
Yeah.
Good thing, I guess.
Yeah.
Good thing.
So, uh, Minneapolis, huh? Did you rent a car or a cab? BoJack, it's all taken care of.
I gotta go.
Is there anything, uh, I can do? I can upgrade your seats, or or send you better fruit.
BoJack, look, I never needed you to be a dad.
I'm going to be fine.
I told you from the beginning, I have eight dads.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
But I've never had a brother.
[techno music playing.]
In Los Ageless The winter never comes In Los Ageless The mothers milk their young [BoJack.]
Nothing's lonelier than a party.
[exhales.]
Good thing I don't need anyone or I might feel lonesome.
Watch your six.
I'd rather watch your six.
[woman chuckles.]
[techno music playing.]
[gunshot.]
[gasping.]
[grunts.]
[Gina gasps.]
Hmm.
[gun cocks.]
What the hell? [director.]
Cut! Come on, guys.
Pay attention.
The squib didn't fire.
What did I do? Not you.
Squib.
Squib.
The squib.
I don't need any help.
Thank you.
You're doing great, BoJack.
Yeah? And I did a great job watching you, which is most of what producing is.
We're doing it, buddy! First day! Listen, I still have some questions about my character, and the script, and the show, and you asking me to do this show, and me saying, "Yes".
Hey, can we get rid of Philbert's watch? The network doesn't want us to remind the audience about the existence of clocks.
And why we're making a TV show for What-Time-Is-It-Right-Now-dot-com, which is a website for people who don't know their computers already have built-in clocks at the corner of the screen? All your questions will be answered.
But in the meantime, would it kill you to smile? [remote clicking.]
[grunts.]
[theme song playing.]
[gunshot.]
[grunts.]
[Gina gasps.]
Dierdre! I should have known! Just like a bitch to shoot me in the heart, bitch.
Good thing I carry this flask full of my dead wife's blood around.
[director.]
And, cut.
Hey, Flip.
Can I ask why I'm calling her a bitch twice? The first bitch is her.
The second bitch is your heart.
Okay, you know, I have some questions about my character.
[sighs.]
[beeping.]
I have two minutes.
Okay, well, my first question is BoJack Horseman Oh, jeez.
Here we go.
and Mr.
Peanutbutter on the same studio backlot? One sec What is this? A mismatched buddy comedy No.
about two guys from different sides of the tracks who learn to respect each other because they have a common interest? Who's this guy? Ignore him.
Why And a grudging respect blossoms into real friendship as they set aside their differences to achieve a shared goal Stop it.
each bringing their own strength to the table, and possibly there's a karaoke scene? Why does John Philbert's house look the same as my house? I've never been to your house.
The set was designed to reflect Detective Philbert.
Spare, lonely, precariously balanced on a hill of his own isolation.
It kind of looks like David Boreanaz's house.
The set designer actually took a tour there.
Oh, that's very interesting.
Why are you here? I'm playing Julius Caesar on the stage next door, in a movie! Well, it's a short film.
I gotta run.
Wait! I'll see you next time I'm Roman around the lot! Flip, when can we talk? Tomorrow morning.
Hi.
Hey.
[drums playing.]
[grunts, groans.]
[pants.]
Yikes, was that it? You done? [exhales.]
Wow.
Sorry, I can't do you.
I'm too distracted, I'd just do a bad job.
You know your own body better than me anyway so just go to town.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Wait, Gina.
Can I ask you a question, about you? Uh-huh? Do you think I'm right, and the Philbert character is poorly written, and Flip needs to write him better, so I don't look so bad? Look, I do one of these shows every year.
And I keep getting hired because I show up, do the work, and keep my head down.
But do you love this script? Do you love your character? Do I love Internal Affairs Director Sassy Malone, whose primary character traits are that she hates bras and loves cold rooms? Not especially.
It feels gratuitous and male-gazey.
But it pays for my expensive habit of having a mortgage in Southern California.
You don't have to go.
We could hang out.
I'm sure you don't wanna be all alone in a house by yourself.
No, I love being alone.
I wish I were alone right now.
[door opens, closes.]
[sighs.]
[inhales, exhales.]
Huh.
[phone beeps.]
[line ringing.]
[Hollyhock grunts.]
BoJack? Why are you up? I could ask you the same question.
Now you're in college you don't need to sleep anymore? No, I was sleeping.
You called me and woke me up.
Oh, right.
I wanted you to know that I hearted your Instagram photo.
Okay, cool.
Well, there were 23 other hearts.
But I don't know if you know who they're all from, but one was from me.
Yeah, they let me know.
Oh, cool, cool.
Okay, I'm going back to sleep.
Fine, but this phone call does not replace our weekly Sunday call.
Okay? Yeah, I'll talk to you Sunday afternoon.
Yes.
Good.
Because I miss you.
Sorry, that sounded dumb.
I don't miss you, I'm just bored.
That also sounded dumb.
I miss you too, BoJack.
[phone beeps.]
[Todd panting.]
Good morning, lovebugs! Don't mind me, just passing through! Not sneaking a peek at the lovebugs! There's nothing to see that would embarrass any of us.
We are all fully clothed.
Ha-ha.
If you say so! What are you gonna do while I'm at work all day? There's an old frog who lives down in the L.
A.
River.
He owes me an egg salad sandwich, on account of a caper we once went on.
What? I was gonna see if he wants to make instruments out of shoeboxes and rubber bands.
And, uh, that will satisfy you? When your life is ends, and you're looking back at this day, you'll think that was a good day? Yeah? Well, from your preliminary paperwork you seem like a perfect candidate.
Thanks, I just never thought it would be like this.
I mean, my mom popped out kids by the dozen.
And I can't even Mnh-mnh.
Princess Carolyn, is your name Cutie Cutie Cupcake? No, that's Were you born on August 12th, 1947? I Do you sleep with your hands stuffed in lotion-filled socks? No.
Right, because you are not your mother.
How did you know What you are is noble, honorable, and unimpeachable.
Anyone can just have a baby.
But to adopt one? That takes a hero.
It takes a selfless, giving, kickass superwoman who's willing to take out her checkbook right now and write the adoption agency a check for $60,000.
Well.
[sighs.]
Okay.
Fabulous.
I'm just so glad that I'm on this journey with you.
Princess Carolyn, I'm with you every step of the way, from you giving me this check all the way to me introducing you to your new caseworker, Tracy.
Hey.
Ah! You're in wonderful hands, bye! Uh, what Congratulations.
What are you, like, five months pregnant? No, I'm not a birth mother.
I'm adopting.
Oh, that makes sense.
'Cause you're so old.
Is Mikhaela ever coming back? [scoffs.]
Yeah, in your dreams.
[sighs.]
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
What?! Jeanine, the script calls for hot and haunted.
Does this girl look hot and haunted to you? Yeah, I'm sure she was hot for Shakespeare in the Park, but I need TV hot.
Actually, she's starting to look haunted.
[door opens.]
Hey! Uh, this a bad time? It's fine.
I can talk to you and also judge these women's bodies at the same time.
What do you want? Okay, well, first of all, the script is great.
Really top-notch stuff.
I love the whole thing of it.
I just wanted to clarify some things about Philbert as a character.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, okay, on page three, is it necessary that Philbert can only orgasm if he's listening to a recording of his dead wife's voice? Yes.
Okay, well, what about this thing on page eight where he goes to a strip club and just sits in the back with a sketch-pad and draws the strippers, while a Leonard Cohen song plays? What about it? It's just that all of these half-naked women.
I mean, I understand it.
I'm just worried it might come across as gratuitous and, uh, male-gazey, which I know it isn't! Hmm.
You know what? You girls can go home.
The stripper scene's cut.
No.
Seriously? Uh, oh.
Uh How am I gonna feed my baby? I just got an idea for something better.
So, instead of drawing strippers naked, you're just going to draw Gina naked.
[BoJack.]
Uh Gina, BoJack was concerned the old scene was gratuitous and male-gazey.
Oh, he was? BoJack said that? [Flip.]
This is much more interesting and motivated by character.
And since it's motivated by character, that means it's not gratuitous.
Thank you for the note, BoJack, you really helped.
Yeah.
Thanks, BoJack, for helping.
Oh, um [Flip.]
Can we get some ice? Can we get some nipple ice for Gina? So, you're the famous Yolanda.
I am not famous.
You might have me confused with another more famous Yolanda.
I know, I-I just meant because Todd talks about you so much, I feel like you're famous.
Oh, well, that was not clear.
Okay.
Todd, why don't you say things now? Steve, you still fixing up your truck? You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend, firefighter Steve D'Marco.
Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio.
We're very different.
But I do have a truck, and I'm fixing it up.
So, thanks for asking.
I created a dating app for firefighters to meet me.
Looks like it worked.
[chuckles.]
Yeah.
Hey! We should create a dating app for asexuals.
Why would asexuals want a dating app? Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.
Uh Think of it this way.
One could be: A, Romantic, or B, Aromantic, while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.
So you could be BB, or BA.
As for me, see AB, see? Uh So, even within the one percent of the population that's asexual, there's an even smaller percentage that is still looking for romantic companionship.
Seems like a pretty thin user base for an app.
But without it, asexual romantics might end up settling for just whatever other asexual romantics they might meet, even if they have nothing else in common.
Well, anyway Yeah, but maybe it's good if they have nothing in common because then they can help each other grow and change, and become fuller, more well-rounded people.
Yeah, that's true.
So, Todd, are you still doing that rabid clown-dentist exercise thing? Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apart when the clowns got loose.
[mystery music.]
Huh? I know you killed your wife, Philbert, and I'm gonna prove it.
[Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Wow! Don't finger me for a murderer, Malone.
I don't know where those fingers have been.
[Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Ooh! Well, how about I show you? [Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Wow! [Flip.]
Cut! Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh.
" You guys are doing a bang-up job over here.
So sayeth Caesar! King of the apes! Look, man, I know what you're doing, okay? You're trying to punish me.
Just don't punish Gina.
I'm not trying to punish anyone.
I'm just trying to make a good show that's brilliant and unprecedented.
It sounds like you guys are basically on the same page.
You're the only one with a problem here.
Gina is fine with it.
Gina is not fine with it.
You guys, you're almost saying exactly the same thing.
Except one of you is saying "not".
Gina, do you have a problem with the nudity in this scene? It's great.
It's brilliant, unprecedented.
I'm gonna get some potatoes.
You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.
So, can we drop it? I know you're used to being the most important person on set.
This is not about me.
It's weird for you that I don't need to listen.
I'm not Hey, hey But if you actually have notes that are helpful, I would love to hear them when you're done swinging your dick around.
No, this is not about my dick.
Okay, fellas Well, maybe it should be about your dick.
What? Since you're so concerned about the male gaze, let's give the females something to gaze at.
We'll do a full-frontal nude scene with you.
This is compromise! This is working together.
Well, hold on.
Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up with both hands to screw in a light bulb.
Yes! He totters in little circles on a tiny stool.
Wouldn't I just turn my wrist? Full body rotation.
We see everything.
Now we're talking! No, we're not! Princess I'm on it.
Flip, BoJack can only do this scene if he can wear a T-shirt.
What? He's very self-conscious about his belly area.
No, I'm self-conscious about my penis area.
He can't wear a shirt.
It's about being vulnerable.
We see every fold and imperfection of his wrinkled, saggy body.
Hey! So we like him.
But he has to be fully erect so we respect him.
What? We'll shoot it tomorrow.
Yeah.
Unless you don't like this idea, in which case, we can go back to what we were doing.
Right.
Well So, you would be admitting that you don't actually care about the male gaze and you were only giving me notes to hear yourself talk.
But that's not it, right? Right.
Great.
Shooting is tomorrow afternoon.
Okay.
I'll send the waxing kit over tonight.
Philbert waxes? Not for cosmetic purposes.
He just wants to feel something.
[chuckles.]
Huh? I like your friend.
It's impressive how she creates companies.
And her boyfriend has an interesting career as well.
Yeah! And you have an interesting career.
Hey! The three of you all have interesting careers.
That is so cool! Todd, do you ever feel weird that you have no discernible life direction? No.
Let me rephrase that.
I feel weird that you have no discernible life direction.
Oh.
I mean What am I supposed to tell people? A story? A joke? Compliments are things people like being told sometimes.
I'm sorry.
How was your day? Did you end up meeting with that frog? No, I just stayed home and looked at stuff on the Internet.
Oh.
[gasps.]
Hello, Princess Carolyn.
You're not Princess Carolyn.
Why are you not Princess Carolyn? She gets home pretty late.
I came all this way for nothing? I brought my spinny chair and everything! Well, if you want something to do, you could help me find a job.
You're looking for a job? I spent all day looking! First, I thought I should get a newspaper to find one, but then I was,Â like, "Where do I find a newspaper?" Uh.
So, I looked it up.
And a map came up of my local area.
So, then I thought about how I know this area pretty well, but there's all kinds of areas I don't know.
Like South Africa.
Okay.
And then I thought about Charlize Theron.
Uh, right.
And then I thought about that movie Monster.
And then I was, like, "What year did that come out?" So I went to Monster.
com [pc clacking.]
to look up facts about the movie Monster, and it turns out they have job postings there! [Bojack sups.]
What a time to be alive! Hey! A posting for WhatTimeIsItRightNow.
com! [Todd.]
Oh, a janitor job.
I've always wanted to Janet! I just got an amazing idea.
Interview for that job! Uh Was that your amazing idea? Because I feel, like, it kinda came out of the room.
When you get in the building, say you need to use the WC.
Then you'll sneak into the office of one of the network execs.
Go into their email and send a message to Flip McVicker telling him he can't film any more nude scenes because they're derivative and unnecessary, especially the nude scenes involving me.
You are throwing a lotta words at me.
Todd, don't you get it? We're gonna save the show! You're on a show? This is a very impressive resume.
Yep.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must adjourn to the restroom.
You founded a ride-share app.
You built and managed your own theme park.
And you were, briefly, Governor of California! I was also the director of a Star Wars movie, but they fired me over "creative differences.
" Now about that restroom Hold on.
You are way overqualified to be a janitor.
Okay.
But I do actually need to go.
Oh, you need to go, all right.
Straight to the top of this company! [gasps.]
We're ready for you on set, Mr.
Horseman.
Just a minute.
[cell phone rings.]
All right! Todd, did you do it? [woman on phone.]
Hold please for Mr.
Chavez.
Already I don't like this development.
[Todd.]
Hey! Good news, bad news.
Good news is I'm now President of Ad Sales and Streamable Content for WhatTimeIsItRightNow.
com and WhatTimeIsItGo.
[BoJack.]
What? Bad news is I can't help you.
Why not? You're their boss now.
You can tell them what to do.
I could, but I'm no leader at all if I can't delegate authority.
I need to focus on big picture stuff.
[grinding.]
Loving that picture.
Can we get it even bigger? Ugh, Todd, your good-hearted naivetÃ© has once again conspired with outrageous happenstance to completely dick me over! Have you tried just talking to the show runner? In my experience, I've found it's best to shoot straight, in the boardroom and on the driving range.
[grunts.]
I gotta jet.
It's Susie in HRs birthday and if I don't show up to these things, people talk, you know what I mean? I never do! [cell phone beeps.]
Hey, Flip, we need to talk.
Okay.
I'm not doing the naked scene.
What? The only reason you wrote it is to embarrass me.
BoJack, I'm not writing scenes for my television show and also directing them in order to teach you lessons or send you secret messages.
I'm just trying to make a good show.
Why do you keep making it so difficult? I'm making it difficult? I have done nothing, but be a friend to you.
I actually called my mom last night and told her that I made a friend on set.
Do you wanna make me a liar to my mother? What? Ew.
Weird.
Take off that robe and go to set.
No.
Take off that robe right now.
Why can't you act like a professional and get naked? Because it's dumb! This whole show is duuuuuuumb! What? It's confusing, it's overwritten, and it's poorly lit.
The darkness is a metaphor for darkness! And worst of all, it's boring! It has nothing to say, and it says that nothing badly! [inhales.]
Let me tell you how this is going to be.
I am the show creator and if I want your character to get naked, he gets naked.
If I want him to speak only in Korean, you're learning Korean.
If I want your character to shit his pants and walk around with shit in his pants for the rest of the season, you will do just that.
[mystery music.]
Oh, come on.
You signed a contract.
And that means I am your god.
You will please your god, and if I don't see your ass on set then I will see your ass in court.
Do you understand? [groans.]
That's a good note about the lighting.
I'll take a look at that.
Good news! We found a birth mother! Really? A-already? She came in yesterday.
She's giving her baby to a sweet couple in Illinois.
What? Oh Did you think we found a birth mother for you? Conceited much? Tracy, Iâm spending a lot of money to be here with you and I'm putting myself in a very vulnerable position.
Is there any way you can be a little more thoughtful with the way you manage me as a client? It sounds like what you're looking for is an adoption manager.
This is an adoption agency.
Do you not know the difference? [sighs.]
[cell phone buzzes.]
What? Princess Carolyn, I overplayed my hand.
BoJack and I got into a fight.
And he never showed up on set.
What? [horn blaring.]
What? [BoJack.]
Princess Carolyyyyyyyn, I need to talk to youuuuuu.
[sighs.]
BoJack.
Hold on, I got a thing with a chair.
How did you even find me? Duh.
Bought a burner phone, slipped it into your purse, and then used the Find My Phone app.
How thoughtful.
[deep voice.]
Hello, Princess Carolyn.
Oh, God.
I have a plan and I need your help.
I found out his mom has a fake leg.
Who's mom? Flip.
I'm gonna seduce her, steal her leg, and then smack him across the face with it until he chokes on his own blood.
It's subtle, but I think he'll get the message.
BoJack, what are you trying to accomplish here? I-I don't want to do the show.
So you're gonna run away like you always do? Yeah.
I never wanted to do this show! You faked my signature! And I told you that, and you said, "Okay" because you wanted to be a good friend to me! So, you can't get points for that and then resent me for it now.
It's not about you! I don't like him! Oh, Flip's not that bad.
He's just insecure and is overcompensating a little.
I know that must be a foreign concept for you.
No, not Flip.
Philbert.
He-he's a drunk.
He's an asshole.
I don't want to be him.
So, maybe don't be the drunk asshole.
Maybe this time, you have a good attitude and you don't drink so much and you show up at your call time.
And then you put on the Philbert costume and you pretend to be this other guy.
And then when you're done shooting, you take off your costume and you're BoJack, the star of the show that everybody likes.
Yeah? Yeah.
Hey, why are we at an adoption agency? Are you adopting something? I'm trying to.
Oh.
So, can you keep it together for the next ten weeks so I don't need to come to set, every day, to put out fires? You think you could do that? For me? [inhales.]
[exhales.]
[Flip.]
Action.
[Diane.]
Hey, stranger.
It sounds like you had an amazing trip.
I did.
What have you been up to? Well, I did play Julius Caesar in a pizza commercial that they're going to [chuckles.]
get this, show in movie theaters.
Wow, look at you.
Pizza.
Et Cru-DitÃ©s? What? That was my line.
I played Little Caesar's dad, Big Caesar, in the back story part of the commercial, which is funny because most commercials don't even have a back story part.
Also, Little Caesar's doesn't sell cruditÃ©s.
Oh, man, my part's definitely going to get cut, huh? Just like the real Caesar! Hey, that's right! Well, here's your place.
[horns honking.]
Yep.
Here it is.
Well, anyway, I signed the papers.
Oh.
Great! Yeah, so if it all looks good to you and your lawyer, you can sign it too and then it'll be official.
Divorce completed.
Yay.
We did it.
Take that, our marriage! Well, I guess I'll see you around? Yeah.
I was going to Sorry.
[both laughing.]
Sorry.
Just go all the way.
Well, bye.
Cool.
[grunts.]
[Flip.]
And, cut.
[buzzes.]
[Flip.]
We got it.
What's that for? We've all seen me naked.
Can't put the genie back in the bottle now, baby.
[crew laughing.]
Thanks anyway, Judy.
This is great.
Any other work environment and this would be considered sexual harassment.
[laughter.]
Ooh, Cadbury Creme Eggs.
Yes, please! Whoops.
Gonna need new yogurt.
[groans.]
I'll make it up to you,.
Party at my house tonight! [crew cheering.]
The last days of the sunset superstars Girls in cages playing their guitars So, then Aaron Eckhart said, "If that's Ansel Elgort, then who's Alden Ehrenreich?" And then I said, "Gesundheit" [all laughing.]
Flip! You made it.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, your house really does look like Philbert's.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Thanks for being so cool today about the naked stuff.
Yeah.
Sure.
Those chicks always make such a big deal about their bodies.
Maybe now that you've done it, Gina won't complain so much next time we make her do it.
Well, no, she didn't complain.
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.
Everything worked out.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm sorry I flew off the handle earlier and tried to remove your robe by force.
This is my first show and I'm still figuring out how to strike the right tone.
No, of course, I'm just trying to help you fulfill your vision.
Yeah.
The main thing you gotta know about me is just don't take things so personal, you know what I mean? Uh, yeah.
Everything we're doing over these next ten weeks, the places I'm going to take you, it's not about you, you know? It's Philbert.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah, you get it.
Oh, my Lord Oh, we really did it now I tell you, buddy, this is going to be a sensational season of television.
[Diane crying.]
[sad music playing.]
[car tires squeaking.]
[crying continues.]
I need to get as far away from Los Angeles as possible.
The handy ticketing screens are behind you and will provide all the answers you need.
Can't you just help me? Screen has all the answers.
[sighs.]
I could really use some personal attention right now.
Where did you want to go? I need to leave tonight.
Anywhere.
Uh, okay.
Hanoi? Vietnam! Yes, perfect! Thank you! Sh-should I punch it into that screen? Uh-huh.
And say nice things about me.
That screen's my supervisor.
[theme music playing.]
[phone vibrating.]
I'm Peter Sagal.
Don't wait, wait.
Do answer your phone.
Stefani? Hey, girl! Just checking up on that clickable content you were working on.
Listen, something came up, and I Where are you? I'm doing a new, fully immersive, 3-D spin class.
[chuckles.]
Oh, you know what? I'm just biking.
Oh.
Well, I just landed in Vietnam [growls.]
Where is my content, Diane? Um I need words for my website.
There are words on the website now, but I need younger words, newer words, fresher words to feed the insatiable beast! Okay, okay, I'll write something while I'm here.
Love it! Feed that beast, girl! Bye! [phone beeps.]
[indistinct chattering in Vietnamese.]
[Diane reading.]
Number one: To reconnect with your ancestral roots.
As a born and raised American, you never felt much connection to your Vietnamese heritage, and your parents offered little to fill in the blanks.
G'aw! You call that a fastball? With an arm like that, you're gonna get booted back to Triple-A, you skeezer! Dad, where are we from? We're from Boston, dummy! Why do you think I talk in this accurate, regional dialect? I know that, but, I mean, what is our background? Why do I look different from the other kids? Ah, shove it up your rear, you jack-off.
You're just the same as anybody else, and don't let nobody tell you different.
I just thought you could give me a little cultural context, what with you being a tenured professor of Vietnamese history at Tufts and all.
Christ, Deedee, that's my job.
I wouldn't ask you to have a period on your day off.
What? Dad, it Okay.
[Diane.]
But you're here, finally.
And it's comforting to see your name everywhere and so many faces, that look like your face.
Ah! Oh.
[speaking Vietnamese.]
Sorry, I don't I don't speak [speaking Vietnamese.]
I don't I don't understand you.
[speaking Vietnamese.]
Oh, is this who you were looking for? Ouch! [speaking Vietnamese.]
I'm sorry.
[Diane.]
It's more foreign than you expected, but that's good.
You want to truly immerse yourself and get the full non-LA experience.
[bike bell rings.]
Ooh! Because sometimes, to find yourself, you need to get as far away from the world you know Coming through! Hot set! Ah! Ah! [man.]
Movie lingo! [sighs.]
Excuse me, hi.
[bell dings.]
What's going on here? Oh, isn't it exciting? Some American filmmakers are shooting a movie, starring Laura Linney! It's about a recently-divorced woman who comes to Vietnam to find herself.
[sighs.]
[Diane.]
You came here to reconnect with your roots, but now you feel stupid for even thinking that was possible.
You put on the clothing you bought, and it feels like a costume.
This is not your home.
You're a tourist here.
Reason number two: you can be a tourist here! [camera shutter clicks.]
[both speaking Vietnamese.]
Can I have number two? Number two? Ah.
Yes.
[speaking Vietnamese.]
Number two.
Thank you.
[speaking Vietnamese.]
[laughs.]
[speaking Vietnamese.]
[speaking Vietnamese.]
[speaking Vietnamese.]
Thank you.
[Diane.]
Sometimes, it's just nice to take a vacation and forget about everything you left behind [phone vibrates.]
I'm Peter Sagal.
Don't wait, wait.
[beeps.]
Hello? Diane! Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Are you okay? You left my party without saying goodbye.
I was like, "Uh-oh, what happened to Diane?" Well Then I got distracted because Todd got his tongue stuck to the ice sculpture.
By the time we got him off, his tongue was completely numb, which made him talk real funny.
Mm-hmm.
Well, that got him in quite the situation when the mob boss, at the roller rink, thought he was making fun of his deaf sister.
I'm sorry, this is turning into a Todd story.
The point is, are you okay? Oh, yeah, sorry.
[stammers.]
I just had a plane to catch, so I'm in Vietnam now Whoa.
but I'll be back soon.
Let me fetch you from the airport.
[bike bell rings.]
Oh, that's okay.
You don't want to deal with the traffic.
You know I love traffic.
I get to catch up on all those hilarious license plates I haven't read yet.
Okay.
Thanks.
Great.
Hey, I have to tell you I'm glad, I'm not still paying your phone bill because this call must be costing a fortune! Unless you remembered to call Ed for the international plan.
Of course I remembered to do that! But I have to hang up now.
Our conversation has reached a natural conclusion, goodbye.
[phone beeps.]
Ugh.
Number three: because you're single now and you can do whatever you want.
Isn't it great being single? [chuckles.]
It sure is! I love that we're mature enough to still be in each other's lives.
I know! Other divorced couples can't handle it, but we're handling it, so well, because we are better than them.
Are we the best divorced couple? I think we might be.
Yeah.
How are you doing with those divorce papers? It's been several weeks now Aah! Hi, folks! I'm Pickles.
Ooh! Have you dined with us before? Yes.
Well the way it works around here is: you look at a menu, pick what you want, I'll bring it to you, and then you pay at the end.
So, like, a restaurant.
Ooh, sounds great.
Can I get you started with drinks? Water would be great.
Oh, my God, I love water.
Me, too! Uh-huh.
I'm 70 percent water! Okay.
Me, too! What are the odds? So, two waters.
Thank you.
So Mr.
Peanutbutter, the divorce papers.
We need to Aah! It's me again, the same dog as before.
Do you know what you'd like to order? Are you bringing our waters? No.
I forgot.
Food, though? Hmm, what do you like here? No, why would you ask Oh, I like everything.
In fact, at the end of my shift, I usually take everyone's leftover scraps and put it in a trough and eat it up.
Miam, miam, miam, miam! But don't mention that to my boss.
We won't.
But that does sound eclectic and delectable.
The trough of everything.
Okay, and Whoa, somebody's not hungry at all.
No, I am! I'm very hungry! [laughs.]
[shouting.]
And I'll have the Cobb salad! Why do you keep humoring her? She's fun.
You know, if we were still married, this would probably be enough to spiral us off into a big argument, that isn't even about the waitress, and we would fight all night.
But since we're not married, I can just be like, whatever.
This is truly great.
So great.
We are doing so great.
Although I do get lonely sometimes in that big house all by myself.
Hey, why don't you have a housewarming party? Eh Yeah! Now that you don't have a mean wife who hates parties He-he, you can finally live it up.
Okay, but only if you come.
Promise? I'll come if you have those divorce papers.
Aah! Me again.
What did you order? I didn't write it down.
The trough! Oh! He wants the trough! Uh, xin loi.
Do you speak any English? We are lost.
I actually speak all of the English.
Oh! Your English is very good.
I am American.
Yes.
American.
We are from America.
I am from America.
No.
Me America.
You Vietnam.
No.
Me America.
Me America! Me America, too.
Me am also America.
[Diane.]
Number four: To meet new people! Hell-oh, uh, I am with the movie.
[music playing.]
No Vietnamese, but I want a drink.
Beer? Glug-glug? [Diane.]
Number five: Get out of your natural habitat.
We all work so hard to cultivate our homes, but what are they other than a place to repeat negative patterns? There.
Last one.
And the first one.
I moved all this other stuff in while you were stretching.
So much for helping.
Oh, did you need help deciding whether or not this place is a shithole? Because help is on the way.
It's a shithole.
I like it.
It's what I can afford and it makes me feel good to do it on my own.
When this place makes you too sad, you can always come over.
You'll have to say, "I'm a sad, sad girl with a terrible, dirty apartment," but I'll let you crash.
This is my home and I am proud of it.
Where did you get all this junk? It's not junk! I just emptied out my storage unit.
This is the stuff that cool, 20-something Diane had to put away when she moved in with old man Peanutbutter.
Oh, can we finally talk shit about Mr.
Peanutbutter? Like how he has dog breath and leaves his hair all over, or is this one of those scam jobs where I talk shit and you nod along, then you two get back together and you hate me because I told you how I felt? When have you not told me how you felt? All you do is tell me how you really feel.
This place smells weird.
I want to go home.
I don't tell you everything.
You do.
There's literally nothing you haven't told me.
Well, did I tell you this place smells weird? Yes.
Help me move this couch.
Okay, you get started.
I'm gonna stretch first.
Anyway, Mr.
Peanutbutter and I are still good friends.
Get the hammies.
I'm going to his housewarming party on Saturday.
You should come.
"Come with?" Diane, just because you have the couch of a girl in her 20s does not mean that you are young enough to say "come with.
" [grunts.]
There.
[light bulb pops.]
Yeesh.
I love it! This is my life now.
[drums.]
Hey! What's going on? Oh, hi, Diane.
[chuckles.]
Some cockroaches in IT tried to unionize, so I just called an exterminator.
[laughs.]
What? Oh.
Sorry, I meant negotiator.
Wait, no.
Who did I call? Anyway, we're gonna have to tent this place for the next month.
Can you work from home till then? I need that listicle on five empowering roles for women over 40, that would be better played by Jennifer Lawrence.
[people screaming.]
What was that? Oh, negotiations.
Bye! [mobile typing.]
[Diane.]
Number six: To turn your work into a "work-cation.
" [typing on laptop.]
In this new era of connectivity, working outside of the traditional workspace can ignite creativity [cat meowing.]
[toilet flushing.]
[water leaking.]
Ew! [door opens.]
Uh? I'm a sad, sad girl with a terrible, dirty apartment.
Come on in.
Okay, one more glass, and then I'm gonna head home.
Why don't you take the guest room? I could make urine stains on the carpet and string up police tape so it feels more like home for you.
Thank you, but I'm excited to be on my own.
I can do whatever I want.
I can pick up in the middle of the night and go to Disney World, or Vietnam.
Do you mean literally Vietnam or like when Old Navy told me they were looking for a fresher face for their Performance Fleece commercials and they ended up with Sherman Hemsley? What? [intense sounds.]
That was my Vietnam.
I just mean I can finally do the things I've always wanted.
I'm in a really good place.
Awesome! [slurring.]
A really good place.
That's the thing people don't understand about me.
[slurring.]
I'm also in a good place.
I got this new job coming up, so I'm gonna fly right, be tight, and sober up real good.
I'm working out a system so I only drink a little each day.
Mm It's my cheat day.
[glass breaks.]
Isn't it weird that this is the first time we're both been single at the same time? Yeah.
Why is it weird? I mean, I know why I think it's weird, but you say a first thing.
It's just, uh Come on, you know why.
It's just weird.
Like, we could totally make out right now.
What? No, I'm not saying we should.
No.
Pfft! No.
I'm just saying we could, and that's weird.
I'm saying it's weird.
Oh.
Uh, I guess so.
Not that I would.
Oh, my God, that's so gross.
You're gross.
You're being mean.
I'm allowed to be mean.
I'm getting a divorce.
Okay, you get two more "divorce means," but then that's it.
I'm cutting you off.
Maybe I should go.
You sure you don't want to stay in the guest room? No.
No, 'cause then that means I'm staying here.
And I cannot stay here again, not after last time.
What do you mean? That was fun.
Was not.
I was a mess.
And then you left me in charge of things and then went who knows where.
Michigan? No, uh, no.
That time I ended up in New Mexico.
I stayed with this family, got close with the daughter, but, um [mystery music.]
Luckily, it worked out all fine.
No, and I-I got a boat, I came back, end of story.
Okay, buddy.
[yawns.]
Hey, Diane, can I ask you a [snoring.]
Oh.
Yeah.
[continuous snoring.]
[Diane moans.]
Oooooooh [sighs.]
[snoring.]
Oh [heavily snoring.]
[door opens, closes.]
[Diane.]
Reason number seven to go to Vietnam: Your therapist tells you to.
Have you thought about going away for a little bit? I don't need to go away.
I'm good.
I have this client who went through a surprisingly tough second divorce.
Let's just call her "Demi M.
" And let's say that her first husband was called "Bruce.
" Talking about Demi Moore? You know I can't divulge personal information about my other clients, Diane.
I'll ask you to be respectful.
But she and her second husband Ashton.
I cannot say, went on a trip, and getting out of her routine allowed her to process things more honestly.
I just feel, like, I see myself very clearly already.
And what I see is that I am happy with my decision.
Mm-hmm.
Another client of mine, Angelina J, who has a lot of adopted kids Is she an actress? As a matter of fact, no.
She thinks of herself as a director.
Wait a minute, do you talk about me in your sessions with other clients? Oh, honey! No.
[Vietnamese music.]
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm trying to get a beer.
Can you help me? Ah? [speaking Vietnamese.]
Oh, my goodness.
[chuckles.]
Thank you.
[Vietnamese music.]
[swallowing beer.]
Ah! I know you can't really understand me, but I'm a nice American dude.
A good guy.
[both laugh.]
Would you want to go for a walk to the markets? I feel totally lost out there and I could really use a local to help show me around.
Ah? [packing bag.]
[Vietnamese music.]
[speaking Vietnamese.]
All right! [Diane.]
Reason number eight: To discover a new you.
You let a handsome stranger follow you through the markets of Hanoi.
[chattering.]
And the smells, sounds, and tastes transport you to another reality.
He tells you stories, he thinks you can't understand, about his life in America, and it's freeing to be this person he thinks you are, this person who isn't bound by her own history or sadness.
This is a person who could do whatever she wants.
[both.]
Mm! Wow! I know this is crazy, but even though you can't understand a word I'm saying, I feel like we have a real connection.
I want to show you something.
[joyful music.]
[Diane.]
Oh! This is Ha Long Bay.
It's where Laura Linney comes to find herself.
I'll bet you've never been on a movie set before, huh? I'm a grip.
The executive grip.
I basically run things here.
It's so cool to see my job through your eyes.
[both moaning.]
Ah! Holy shit, a falling klieg light! [man.]
Sorry! Uh, can you speak English? [mystery music.]
No I just heard someone say that sentence in an American movie once.
Also that sentence.
Also, yes, I speak English.
What?! I'm from LA.
So what? You were just pretending this whole time? I was actually feeling something special here.
Really? It didn't strike you as weird that you talked for two hours straight and I said nothing? Or is that what felt special? I am not the bad guy here.
You're a liar! Okay, and you got to have your little Miss Saigon cosplay, so why don't we call it a draw? Get off my set! Your set? Nice try, buddy.
I know what a grip does.
At best, you're the best boy at best.
Are you kidding me? Why does this happen to me every time I go on location? [door slams.]
Ugh! [Vietnamese music.]
[Diane.]
Reason number nine to go to Vietnam: Because it's good to get out of your routine.
Is that similar to reason number five: get out of your natural habitat? No, it's a different thing.
It's fine.
It's whatever.
[door opens.]
Ooh, hey.
What are you doing here? We're going to the party, remember? You told me to "come with.
" Why do you look so different? Do you like it? [laughs.]
It's a whole new, fun me.
My therapist thought I needed to get out of my routine.
I mean, I thought it, too.
It was mostly me who thought it, but my therapist also [sighs.]
Ta da! Did you get a longer neck or something? I did not get a longer neck.
It's a haircut.
Does it make my neck look long? No.
Uh, you actually look amazing.
Don't try to take advantage just 'cause I'm all vulnerable right now.
Jesus, lady! I'm just trying to give you a compliment! Relax, I was joking.
Were you? [sighs.]
Let's just go to the party.
God, you're all over the place.
You hate parties.
I don't hate parties.
You hate parties.
I'm fun.
Okay, you know what? Forget this.
I'm sorry.
BoJack Hey.
Your haircut looks great.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's gonna love it.
[door creaking.]
[dance music playing.]
[chattering.]
Hey, Diane! Hey.
I love what you did to your neck.
I didn't Did you see that ice sculpture? I am definitely not going to lick it.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Anyway, I can't stay long because I'm supposed to go to the roller rink later.
Uh-huh.
I hope, there won't be any mob bosses there.
Well What am I saying? That's so random.
Have you seen Mr.
Peanutbutter? I don't know.
Did you check the library? Ugh.
'Kay, I gotta go.
There's a letter I wanna send.
I need to lick the stamp.
Hopefully, I'll remember to do it before I put my roller skates on Okay.
so I don't accidentally miss the stamp with my tongue and then roll down the stairs with my tongue out and then smack right into the ice sculpture with my tongue.
That would be pretty bad, but I wouldn't put it past me.
[dance music continuous.]
[people chatting.]
Who are all these people? Mr.
Peanutbutter.
There you are! Diane, nice haircut! Oh, this? No, I didn't Yeah! It really brings out the neck of your neck.
Okay, well, that's Hey, don't go anywhere, okay? I want to talk to you.
Oh.
[chuckles.]
How was Erica! What are you doing here with a child-sized coffin? [sighs.]
Oh, my God, are you okay? I saw everything.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I can't pick sides in this divorce because I'm good friends with the both of you, but I want you to know, no matter what, I'm here for you and also there for him.
And if you ever need anything, just let me know and I'll be your rock, as long as it doesn't conflict with me also being Mr.
Peanutbutter's rock, or my work, which is keeping me very busy.
Excuse me, I have to take this.
Hi, Flip? Yeah, are we sure we need this strip club set? Because once we put the deposit down, we cannot get that money back.
[dance music continuous.]
[people chatting.]
[sighs.]
[Diane.]
Reason number ten to go to Vietnam: Because you've gotta leave to come back home.
[phone beeps.]
[line ringing.]
[BoJack.]
Hello? Hey.
Hey.
[sad tune.]
I'm sorry.
I've been so weird.
I'm going through some shit.
I know.
Yeah.
And I just really need a friend right now.
You know what I mean? A friend? Yeah.
I get it.
Okay.
Thanks.
This is Diane, by the way.
Nguyen? Yeah.
Nguyen.
[phone beeps.]
[Diane.]
You're not entirely sure what life will be like when you get home, but maybe that's good because that means anything could happen.
Oh, my God, you're Laura Linney! People say that to me all the time.
And it's true.
I am Laura Linney.
I'm so sorry to bother you, but I have to ask, the movie you were filming, what happens at the end? You get divorced, you go to Vietnam to find yourself, but then what? How does it work out? Well, I do find myself.
Oh.
My clone.
Oh.
And she's shacked up with my ex.
Hmm? I fly into a jealous rage and gut him with a machete, but not before realizing that this whole thing goes all the way to the top.
So me and my clone have to team up and head to Dubai.
A lot of it is setting up the franchise.
You know how it is.
Um it's an action movie? And a love story.
Me and my clone have a steamy make-out scene, which is hot but also very progressive.
[PA system beeps.]
Excuse me.
Can I get some pretzels? I'm Laura Linney.
[Diane.]
But none of those reasons are why you actually went to Vietnam.
[plane taking off.]
Hey, stranger.
[joyful tune.]
[Mr.
Peanutbutter chuckles.]
Yeah, so, if it all looks good to you and your lawyer, you can sign it, too, and then it'll be official.
Divorce completed.
Yay! We did it.
Take that, our marriage! Well, I guess I'll see you around? Yeah.
Oh! I was going for the Oh, sorry.
Did you? [laughs.]
Sorry.
Just go all the way.
Well, bye.
Cool.
Diane, wait.
I actually have something to tell you.
I don't know the best way to say this, but I'm seeing someone.
Romantically.
Who isn't you.
That was probably not the best way to say it.
[dance music playing.]
So, as I was saying, being there for you right now is my top pri [phone vibrates, beeps.]
Oh.
Hold on.
Stuart! There's a fire extinguisher under my desk.
Oh, that's what's on fire? In that case [Diane.]
The real reason you go to Vietnam is because you accidentally see your soon-to-be ex-husband kiss someone else.
[both chuckle.]
At first you think, "Oh, it's a fling.
Whatever, they're drunk, it's a party.
" [sad tune.]
But he puts his hand on the small of her back exactly the way he used to do to you.
[both.]
Mmm.
It means "I've got you," [sad tunes continue.]
and when he did it to you, it made you feel safe.
And you realize he will never do that to you again.
[crying.]
And it breaks your heart, again after your heart was so broken that you thought it could never get any more broken.
You thought it was safe, but it still, somehow, finds a new way to break.
Because, even though, you're the one who asked for this, now that you've got it, you are completely adrift with no compass, or map, or sense of where to go, or what to do.
So you go to Vietnam.
You think you might find community, a connection to something bigger, but you don't.
In fact, you feel even more alone than you were before you left.
But you survive.
[sad tunes continue.]
You learn that you can survive being alone.
[sad tunes intense.]
[sighs.]
I'm really happy for you, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
[night crickets.]
[singing in Vietnamese.]
[jazz music playing.]
I think, the most important thing here is that we're honest with each other and ourselves.
Do you agree? Uh, yes? It says, here, you failed your last six health inspections.
Ooh.
How are you still in business? I wanna say moxie? But possibly spunk.
[chuckles.]
I can't believe I fell asleep at your house.
These shoots are messing up my rhythm.
It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.
m.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna make a habit of spending the night or day.
I get it.
We work together, we make sex together, we don't talk about feelings, and yet sometimes a begrudging respect can blossom into Nope.
"Blossoms into nothing" is what I was gonna say.
You cut me off, so you look stupid.
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.
Look, I took some dumb pictures.
[BoJack.]
All right.
Stupid.
Real stupid.
[BoJack.]
You can delete some.
You have a weird eye.
Obsessed much? This is what it would look like if corpses could drool.
[laughs.]
Hi, excuse me, can I get The BoJack? What is that? It's an off-the-menu item for those in the know.
Obviously, I'm BoJack and I always order the BoJack sandwich.
That's kooky.
Why would your name be a sandwich name? Because I own this restaurant and I'm a celebrity.
So, are all sandwiches named after celebrities? Is chicken salad a celebrity? No, that's just a thing they put in the sandwich.
That's not someone's name.
Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.
What? I'll have a burger.
BoJack, I'm going to the can.
Have fun with the waitress.
[water running.]
[humming rhythmically.]
Um.
It's me, Pickles, from before.
It's cool dating a celebrity.
Okay.
I'm also dating a celebrity.
Should we start a club? I call vice president.
I'm not dating anyone.
And if I had to guess, I'd say neither are you.
Guys in this town, especially celebrities, are not exactly the settle-down type.
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.
He doesn't have a problem committing.
In fact, he just got out of his third marriage.
A celebrity who just got divorced.
Yeah.
No way he'll break your heart.
Do you think Mr.
Peanutbutter and I are moving too fast? I don't know you or your relationship, but I have been around the block a few times.
I was even on an ABC procedural, called The Block, which aired a few times.
The key is to have zero expectations, and then you'll never be disappointed.
Hmm.
Yeah, zero expectations, which also seems to be the mantra of this restaurant.
Thank you.
[theme music.]
She looks dead.
But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.
Poor girl had dreams.
And there's nothing more precious than dreams.
Philbert takes a drag of his cigarette, then kneels down to inspect the corpse.
[Flip.]
Cut! [buzzer buzzes.]
BoJack, you said the stage directions again.
Sorry.
My brain is kinda muddled.
It's these night shoots.
I think it works.
John Philbert doesn't play by the rules.
He says his stage directions out loud.
It's confusing, which means the show is daring and smart.
Hey, wanna go check out craft services? Mm-mm.
How could whatever you're listening to be more fun than hearing me rant about the fruit spread? Is your rant honeydew related? It's in the honeydew area, but the specifics are what keep it fresh each time.
Uh-huh.
[joyful music.]
[grunting.]
[groans.]
Are you ready to go? Yeah.
Sorry, I didn't realize how late it got.
If only there was an easy way to keep track of what time it is right now.
I'll go change.
No, keep your suit on.
My parents are gonna be impressed I'm dating an executive.
Cool! I've never impressed parents before.
I believe that.
Listen, I haven't told my family I'm asexual, so it might be best if, for tonight, we just pretend we're sexually active.
I mean, it's a family dinner.
What are the odds they're going to ask questions about our sexuality, right? Right [mystery music.]
Right.
Yeah Yeah.
[Pickles.]
Hmm.
Aha! Whoa.
Slow down.
Stop.
We're here.
Mr.
Peanutbutter? Am I Steve Carell taking a dramatic role in Little Miss Sunshine, and you are the American public that only knows him for his comedic work? Because surprise! Oh, my God.
Are you the umlaut in ChloÃ« Sevigny's name, right now? Because I don't know why you're here, but I'm glad you are.
As Courteney Cox said when she discovered a rotting corpse in the woods near the Cougar Town set, "Good God, I hope you're not busy.
" What? This is a thinker.
You'll get it later.
Okay.
I have a very fun plan for tonight.
I just heard that they're going to blow up the International Space Station.
Oh, my God.
Blow it up? Why? No one knows why space people do things.
But I thought we could road trip out to the desert and witness the explosion in all her glory.
That sounds amazing! I'm so glad you're as excited as I am, and not mad at me for trying to surprise you with something nice.
Yeah! But are we moving too fast? A wise lady, in the bathroom, told me some stuff.
Ooh, she sounds smart.
Better listen.
I think her name was Hamburger.
Maybe we should wait, some days, before going on another date.
Okay.
If that's how you feel, you stay here and do nothing, and I'll go have this amazing, once-in-a-lifetime experience all by myself.
It does sound cool.
I could also drive to the desert.
If we're both going, we might as well carpool.
That's smart! But just to be clear, we're slowing things down.
It's not a date.
[chuckles.]
Exactly.
Is this that mysterious, brown hors d'oeuvre I ate at Mark McGrath's pool party, last week? Because oh, boy.
Not a date.
[rhythmic music.]
and finally, Carnegie.
Thus, concludes the two-item list of acceptable melons.
[humming rhythmically.]
Always with the earbuds.
What are you listening to? Hey! No Ugh! [musical playing.]
[laughs.]
What is this? This is so corny.
It's not corny.
I mean, it's technically a musical about corn, but it's actually sophisticated.
Wait a second.
Are you into musicals? I sense you'll make this a thing.
Well, well, well, the stone-hearted cynic, who thinks feelings are for suckers, has a secret soft spot for sappy musicals.
Okay.
When you say, "Okay," do you mean okay like "correct," or okay like "OK-lahoma"? Oklahoma All right.
Step-ball-change, step-ball-change, shuffle off to Buffalo, and big finish.
BoJack, watch out! Whoa! [Gina.]
Ah oh, God.
Ouch! God damn it! Once again, my life has been worsened by a brush with musical theater.
[groans.]
Oh, yes, it's true I'm feeling so romantic Driver, can you put on something less romantic? I have a podcast about the space station explosion.
Oh, good idea! Nothing is less romantic than learning.
[on radio.]
From Girlcroosh, I'm Diane Nguyen and this is the Crooshcast.
Oh.
My ex-wife has a podcast.
This is probably weird for you.
No, it would only be weird if we were on a date, but we're not, so [Diane.]
I'm here with Laika, the first woman in space.
Laika, why are we blowing up the space station? [Laika.]
On International Space Station, everything ten years old.
All phone chargers is for original iPhone.
[laughs.]
Hotcha! I make jokes.
But is always designed to go exploded.
Is called "planned obsolescence.
" [Diane.]
Planned obsolescence.
[chuckles.]
Sounds like a good description of my last marriage.
Well, that's probably enough of this.
No.
Leave it on.
[Diane.]
Now he's dating a girl about 20 years younger than him.
Honestly, she's the one I feel bad for.
[laughs.]
Why does she feel bad for me? We should put on something else! You got it.
[DJ.]
Coming up, we got a brand-new single from Twenty-One Pilots.
Ew, back to the podcast.
Todd is the president of ad sales.
Mm, look at you.
And he went to a really good college.
I did? That's very impressive.
I'm afraid we don't know a lot about the world of big business.
As I'm sure Yolanda has told you, I'm but a humble, best-selling, erotic novelist and my wife is a world-famous, adult, film star, and Yolanda's identical twin sister, Mindy, is a sex advice columnist.
Wow! Yolanda told me all of that.
That's all really great information, that I was already privy to.
Well, the important thing is that Yolanda is happy and she's finally found a man, woman, or object to have sex with.
Todd is very accomplished at sexual intercourse.
Aren't you, Todd? Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.
Hooba, hooba.
Um Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"? Uh You know, Todd, I have a bit of a reputation, myself.
[moans.]
Whoa! Okay, we should be hitting the road.
Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.
You know, I saw the erotic dessert in the kitchen.
Who knew you could make such a realistic anus out of marzipan? You can thank my husband.
He posed for the baker.
Wow, you know, it really puts the "um" in "yum.
" I insist you spend the night and make love in my home.
Uh I can't think of a reason, you wouldn't want to have sex in your parents' house.
Unless, you don't enjoy sex.
[sudden sounds.]
No! Of course we'll spend the night, and fornicate.
[rhythmic music.]
Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene where you make your big confession.
Oh, yeah? I was thinking you could maybe confess in song! [grunts.]
Whoa, hey! BoJack, shut up and get in here.
Okay, look at that! Found an emotion.
I'm gonna tell you something very personal.
When I was a little girl, my mom took me to see A Kernel of Truth on Broadway.
It wasn't a big hit.
Yeah, I know.
I Googled the reviews so I could mock you.
That Frank Rich could be a real frank bitch, am I right? Well, I was six and it blew my mind.
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day, getting to sing on Broadway.
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.
So now I get steady TV work, which is fine, and I'm fine, but I still listen to that musical because it reminds me of a time when I was less jaded, when I believed I could do anything, and that makes me feel good.
Oh, my God, Gina.
I-I didn't realize how much this musical meant to you.
And that that's even funnier! Oh! [laughs.]
Oh, come on! You know if this were reversed, you'd be giving me shit.
Ugh! Hey, Gina, I'm sorry.
I was just teasing.
I was It was [sighs.]
Gina, come out of the bathroom.
Gina? Oh, right.
[Laika.]
So, he make for you room, that you always have dream of, and this is why you leave? Seems like overreaction.
[laughs.]
Oh, thank you! [Diane.]
Okay, we're gonna take a break.
I'm getting kinda hungry.
We could stop at a restaurant, but that's kind of a date thing.
Well, fast food doesn't count, right? Look, there's a KFC at the next exit.
Perfect.
[piano music playing.]
Welcome to KFC, which stands for Kiki's French Cuisine.
Hon hon hon! [gasps.]
[both.]
Oh.
I'm not sure I want to wear the pajamas your dad gave me.
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.
Is it just me or was your sister flirting with me? Ugh, when we were in high school, I was still trying to figure out my sexuality, so, I dressed as Mindy, and tried to seduce her boyfriend.
Hmm.
I quickly realized I wasn't into it, but Mindy found out, and now that I have a boyfriend, she probably wants to have sex with you to get revenge.
Typical sister stuff.
I thought sisters were doing it for themselves.
I mean, what does she need me for? [knocking.]
Todd, can you help me move some furniture? My husband has a hernia.
Yeah, no, I noticed in the marzipan.
So, what, uh, furniture do you want me to [sighs.]
Oh, no! Your garment fell.
This must be so embarrassing for you.
Just as I suspected.
You're not sexual at all.
Like, heck I'm not.
Any ordinary man would be madly aroused by the body that starred in every single porn version of a John Hughes movie: Sixteen Cans, Titty in Pink, The Breakfast Chub, Homo Bone I gotta go.
Cum Kind of Wonderful, Penis Bueller Gets Off, Planes, Trains and Autoerotic-mobiles.
[panting.]
[shouts.]
When the cock crows midnight, meet me under the old willow tree in the backyard for sex.
Zoinks! [laughs.]
[panting.]
Okay, quick update.
Mindy wants to meet me for backyard sex at midnight, and your mother knows I'm asexual.
She showed me her boobs.
Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!" Oh, I didn't! Oh, no! She'll disown me! We gotta convince her you're super horny.
How? If Mindy told my mom that you made a pass at her, that would prove you're not asexual.
Here's the plan.
We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.
Who is this cock? When she's at the backyard, I'll sneak in her room and wear her clothes.
I'll pretend I'm Mindy and tell my mother you made a pass at me.
Okay, this sounds a little complicated, but I think I can handle exactly this amount of complication as long as things don't become one bit more complicated.
[musical playing over earbuds.]
Hey, I'm sorry I made fun of your dream.
[sighs.]
It's okay.
Just don't tell anyone about it.
Good news; too late.
I talked to Flip and Princess Carolyn about how you're into this Broadway crap What? and they said maybe you can sing in the nightclub episode.
Can you believe it? Oh, my God.
It's your big break, and I helped! I don't want help.
Why would you do that? I know you don't want me doing nice things because I'm not your boyfriend, and you're a sentient wall of spikes, but they want to hear you sing at the next break.
Here's a song! Hell, no! Gina, this is your dream, and there's nothing more precious than dreams.
It doesn't work that way.
You're used to being the star, so good things always happen to you.
I'm not the star.
I'm the third on the call sheet for Murder Hospital, or Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.
And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60, I can get ajuicy season arc on the right cable show where everyone goes, "Who's this 60-year-old woman? She came out of nowhere.
" Then I win an Emmy in a movie where I play Benjamin Bratt's mother.
Gina, I know, but what I'm saying is, what if you are the star? I'm not.
But what if you are? If you don't try, you'll never know.
You'll spend the rest of your life wondering if you could have made it or not.
Is that what you want? Always the Bratt's mom and never Da Brat? [scoffs.]
Okay.
Yeah? Yeah.
Just so I don't have to wonder, right? Exactly.
I'm gonna go get ready.
This is dumb, but thank you, BoJack.
[piano music playing.]
[exhales, giggles.]
[birds giggling, cooing.]
[both munching.]
You know, this is actually really freeing.
I feel like, I can say all the things I would never say on a date.
Like that I've never seen The Wire, and I don't think I'm gonna.
Well, I'd never tell a date that I get the New York Times, but I only read the style section and throw the rest away.
I don't have or want children, but I silently judge every parent that I see in public.
I sleep with a chew toy, since I was a kid.
[chuckles.]
I still have feelings for Diannnne.
Oh.
That's much less fun than the other things.
Uh, listen Let's just finish our meal and go see the explosion.
[Mr.
Peanutbutter groans.]
[both slurp.]
[both sigh.]
[drums beat.]
It's midnight! And I'm the cock.
[rhythmic sounds.]
Here I come.
[giggles.]
Okay.
[giggles.]
Ah! Mrs.
Buenaventura! I was trying to understand how someone could be like you, so I did a little research.
Did you know a computer can do more than just find porn? I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.
I've grown tired of the whole world thinking of me as a sex object.
For once in my life I would like to have a close, intimate experience that has nothing to do with sex.
[shouts.]
[gasps.]
Asexualize me like one of your French girls, Todd.
Gulp! [rhythmic sounds.]
I can't believe he didn't show up.
Only makes me want him more.
Hmm.
Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.
You can tell because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.
Mindy, come down here.
I have a question only you can answer.
Oh, okay.
If you really want to be asexual, first, you have to put on every piece of clothing you own.
That's how we make sure we don't look sexy.
So, leave me and go do that.
Very well, but I'll be back to not have sex with you.
Ooh, I'm getting less excited just thinking about it.
Hoo-hoo! Hooba, hooba.
Ooh.
I need some advice, Mindy.
That's me.
I'm definitely Mindy.
So you keep saying.
Look, I'd like to give your sister Yolanda this.
[grunts.]
The last barrel of your great grandmother's secret recipe personal lubricant.
As you know, when a Buenaventura is about to make love for the first time in our home, we always give them a barrel of the family lube.
Uh, well Antique lube of this purity is worth at least $100,000.
Ah-ooga! [rhythmic sounds.]
Hello, baby, it's me, your girlfriend Yolanda.
I came to ravage you.
There's something different about you, but I can't put my finger on it.
Todd, take off your pants and get in bed.
Wait.
What? My dad is about to give us very expensive lube just for having sex in this house.
And which sister are you? What the hell are you doing in here? Todd, tell Mindy to get her ass out of here, so we can get nasty.
I'm Yolanda.
Get away from my boyfriend! Don't listen to her, Todd.
I'm clearly Yolanda because I'm dressed like a dumb loser.
I'm so confused.
I'm Todd, right? Maybe, this'll clear things up.
Mindy's the one who's about to die! [groaning, moaning.]
Oh, dear, I'm too late.
They're already having sex.
[sighs.]
They don't need the lube.
[Yolanda.]
Ouch! That hurts! Or maybe they do need the lube.
[door opens.]
Ha! Can't see me now, world.
Angelica, as I jizz and breathe, what the hell are you wearing? Oh, no! The lube! Oh, dear! [Mr.
Buenaventura.]
Oh! That's too slippery! Ho, oh, oh, oh! [grunts.]
[Todd.]
Oh, my God! [Mrs.
Buenaventura.]
Ah! Oh! [Yolanda.]
Oh! [Mindy.]
Oh, no! Our grandma's sexily spinning in her grave.
Todd, you gotta save the lube! Just plug the hole with your erect penis! What? No.
It's the only thing that'll fit the hole perfectly.
There has to be another way.
Surely it's erect since you've been just having sex with my daughter, so unless you've been deceiving me, this whole time, in my own home, there's no logical reason, for you, not to whip out your erect penis and plug the damn hole! Todd, the lube! I'm gonna try my big toe.
That's the penis of the foot.
[Yolanda.]
Oh, God, be careful! [Todd.]
Whoa! Look out! [Yolanda.]
No! Whoa! [all shouting.]
[Mindy.]
Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Mr.
Buenaventura.]
I can't look! [all.]
No! [Mindy sighing.]
[Yolanda sighs.]
[all shouting.]
Before I start, just to give some context because the song doesn't make sense if Okay, so, it's 1712, and American colonist Sybilla Masters is perfecting her invention.
Can we lose the liner notes and get to the singing? I'm a producer.
I can't just sit around having conversations, all day.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Of course.
[inhales, exhales.]
We love our corn And we need our corn But for goodness sake I could just break it in pieces Would it be all right If I solved our plight? Maybe if I could find my old journals They'll help me to grind new kernels Aw, shucks! I have the willpower To create this mill tower We'll be quite a pair Though I'll be my own scarecrow It's not just a phase [voice croaks.]
This female inventor craze If it takes years or days I'm gonna solve this maize 'Cause I was boooooorn For the cooooooooooorn I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go.
Thank you.
And I'm sorry.
And [clears throat.]
I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
That was weird.
You know what, she was nervous, and BoJack, I don't know what kind of power games you two are playing, but keep it in the bedroom.
That was just mean, to her and to us.
No.
I thought she'd be good.
I was trying to do a nice thing.
And I would like to be judged solely on my intentions this time.
[both grunting.]
[both shouting.]
Interloper! You ruined our family heirloom.
Ah! I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy [both grunting.]
That's for trying to trick Todd into having sex with you! And that's for having sex with my boyfriend in high school! I never had sex with him! Yes, you did! The whole school knew about it.
No, I didn't.
I was going to, but I ran away because I'm [shouting.]
asexuaaaaaaaaal! [gasping.]
You know, it felt good to finally tell them.
I was surprised how cool they were with it.
Yeah, I kind of forgot that despite our differences, they're family and they love me.
So, I guess all that sneaking around was completely pointless.
Hey, you're right! What a silly waste of time.
Hey, can I ask you something? Of course.
Why did you tell your family I went to college? Oh, I don't know, I guess I just wanted you to seem impressive.
Impressive to who? Todd [sighs.]
To whom.
[sighs.]
Yolanda, we need to break up.
What? The only thing we have in common is that we're asexual.
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you, whom's smart and accomplished and whom went to college And also doesn't want to have sex? Yeah.
Probably.
But what if there isn't? Well, then let's make a deal.
How about if neither of us meet anybody else by the time we're a hundred, we give this another shot? When we're a hundred? I don't know.
Are you gonna steal my dentures and use them to build some sort of motorized nutcracker, but then the nutcracker's AI becomes self-aware and leads all the other dentures in the nursing home in a toothy revolt? I wanna say no, but probably yes.
[sighs.]
Well, then, I guess I'll see you when we're a hundred.
[soft, calm music playing.]
[Pickles shivers.]
Come on, you're shivering.
Please, just take the blanket.
No, I'm okay.
Are you the type of war dramatized in The Hunt for Red October? Because you're cold.
That one doesn't even make sense.
How do you hunt a month? I know that it was really hard to hear what I said in the restaurant, but I want you to know everything about me, even the hard stuff.
I get it.
This is a bad time for you to start a relationship.
[laughs.]
Of course it's a bad time! I just signed divorce papers.
But I can't control when I meet someone special.
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend I don't want to see you every night? But what if I'm like the space station? After a while, you get bored of me and replace me with someone new.
Look, I don't know the future.
This could end in heartbreak for both of us.
I mean, most relationships do.
And if I'm honest, it's not usually me that gets bored.
But I'd like to see where it goes because I like you.
[chuckles.]
And we have fun together.
And every time we see each other, I like you a little more.
Hmm.
Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge against Katy Perry, right now? Because even though it makes no sense, I want to be held for a superlong time.
[Mr.
Peanutbutter chuckles.]
Mmm.
Mmm.
[romantic music playing.]
[phone clicks.]
[sighs.]
[crying, sniffles.]
[folk rock music playing.]
[sighs.]
Hey, Gina.
Hi.
[stammers.]
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought Hey, from now on, let's just stick to the original rules and not get in each other's business.
Yes, of course.
[stammers.]
I'm sorry.
I didn't even For the record, you were right.
If I didn't sing there, I would have spent the rest of my life not knowing if I ever could have made it or not.
Now I know.
So, good.
You had a bad audition.
It doesn't mean that everything I said it's fine.
You did your good deed, so, you can feel good about yourself.
Hmm.
I'm going to bed.
If you want to have sex with me, you can.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.
O-Okay.
Uh Hmm.
[distant explosion.]
[sighs.]
[music continues.]
[smooching.]
[Pickles giggling.]
[music continues.]
[siren wails, stops.]
[car door opens, closes.]
Sir, please get back into your car.
Here's how it's gonna go down.
You're gonna let me go.
If you're lucky, I might even honk your boobies! Whoa! Hey! Hey! For assaulting a police officer.
You're arresting me? You must be new here, on the rag, or both.
I'm movie star Vance Waggoner, and I hate Jews! [drums.]
This is the Deep Dive! My guest today recently said some things, or did some things? I only read the headline.
Vance, what happened? [sighs.]
First of all, I don't hate Jews.
If I did, would I be able to sit in the same room as my good friend Mark Feuerstein, a Jew? You know, when I first heard Vance's comments, they stung, but when he called to offer his apology and a supporting role in his next movie, I thought, "Does not the Torah teach us to forgive?" As it is written, "schmear, don't smear.
" [drums.]
Hey! Good to see you.
Thanks for coming, everyone! [camera clicking.]
Hey! Hey, Vance, did you get practice swinging that baseball bat from the time you hit that prostitute, with a baseball bat? What? Who told you that? I'm Tom Jumbo-Grumbo, and this is Gotcha! Vance Waggoner, you hit a woman with a baseball bat.
What's your side of the story? Okay, look, when that altercation occurred, I was an immature child of 38.
I'm not that guy anymore.
Vance Waggoner respects women.
We have a tape of a voicemail you left for your 14-year-old daughter.
Oh, God.
Let's give it a listen, shall we? [tone beeps.]
I'll murder you.
I'm going to murder my daughter.
I don't respect women.
You're out there, hanging out with your dirty Swedish friends.
That's right, I hate Swedes now.
I bet you didn't see that coming, you disgusting slut, who is my daughter! [tone beeps.]
As we say here on Gotcha, that's a gotcha.
Why did I go on a show called Gotcha? [camera shutters clicking.]
I stand here with my wife beside me, and my daughter, and my good friend Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd.
I am retiring from public life.
[press corps gasps.]
This is the last you'll see of Vance Waggoner.
Who are we gonna get to play Philbert's partner? We need a bad boy.
Someone dangerous, someone you see coming and think, "This guy is trouble.
" You know who would be perfect? [theme music playing.]
[growls, grunts.]
Thank you so much for meeting me.
Of course.
I know how busy you are.
The Apology Tour can be a hassle, but you've been handling it perfectly.
What do you have lined up next? Well, I'm getting the lifetime achievement at the We Forgive You Awards.
You're getting a Forgivie? Damn, your publicist is good.
I don't care about awards.
I just want to work, damn it.
You just have to remind them how good you are.
Maybe by taking a meaty role on my gritty, prestige television show Philbert.
Once word gets out that it's okay to hire you again, all the other offers will come rolling in.
Producers are like lemmings.
Hey, I resent that! Me, too! I also resent that.
To the cliff! Yeah, let's go.
I have a great deal of love and respect for the lemming community! Okay, I'm in.
Diane, can you believe this? Vance Waggoner is getting a We Forgive You Award! Ugh! This town is full of hypocrites.
They act all shocked when one of their favorite stars turns out to be a dirtbag, but they can't wait to give a comeback to all the dirtbags we already know about.
Now, that is the kind of story I would share without reading, which, for our purposes, is even better than people reading.
Go to the awards show, take down that skeevy so-and-so, and then during commercial breaks, get in some Hollywoo hobnobbing.
Oh, I'd rather not.
Diane, you have to hobnob.
Have you not been hobnobbing? Hob that nob, girl! We know how this ends.
Our core readership eats it up, a bunch of dude-bros call me a "dumb slunt," and Vance's career chugs, right along.
So, stellar! And while you're there, you can ask your friend BoJack, why Vance is gonna co-star on his new TV show.
He's what? Oop! Aaaah! [explosive music.]
Greetings, from the red carpet! Filling in for a Mario Lopez-type, 'tis I, Mr.
Peanutbutter! And lookie here! [yelps.]
Super-producer and also my manager, Princess Carolyn! Who are you wearing and why haven't you called, about the Dog Day Afternoon reboot? Uh It's cool.
We can talk.
They cut around stuff they don't need.
Oh, okay.
No one understands how to make a woman feel beautiful like Louis Kitton.
Listen, kid.
Dog Day Afternoon isn't gonna happen for you.
People don't see you as the tough guy.
That's not fair.
Who are you excited to see tonight? So many amazing stars are being forgiven tonight.
Megyn Kelly, Mark Wahlberg [laughs.]
Look, every actor has a range, and maybe a gritty drama about a tough-guy bank robber is too much of a stretch for you.
So, I'm not tough enough, huh? I'll show them how tough I can be.
We'll be back with more of the Red Carpet Pre-Show Fashion-Stravaganza, so don't touch that remote [growls.]
or else.
[choral music playing.]
There is no one this town loves forgiving more than Vance Waggoner.
[applause.]
I just don't get why you're doing this.
We need a big star, Diane.
No, Diane's right.
I'm the big star.
That's not my point.
You can't have two stars.
All the greatest detective shows are focused around a central, usually titular character.
Kojak, Monk, Nickis.
Who's Nickis? You know, Nickis.
Sometimes, he goes to Los Angeles, to New Orleans Are you? Do you mean NCIS? No.
Princess Carolyn, if you hire this guy, what kind of message does that send? Diane, we both know the industry is screwed up.
I'm not talking to the industry.
I'm talking to you.
Take some responsibility.
Excuse me? Hey! Cheese plate! Vance Waggoner! [cheering, applause.]
Ugh! [camera clicks.]
Horseman forcefully forgoes applause for Vance at Forgivies! Is a feud forming on the Philbert front? That's the buzz around town, and the question on everybody's mind is, "Why the strong face?" He made the face in protest because of what Vance said about native Alaskans.
BoJack's clearly upset about the time Vance Waggoner said the Madrid train bombings were "a real mixed bag.
" Remember when Vance locked that shopgirl in a hotel room and said, "I've got pizzazz" while masturbating into a champagne flute? Because BoJack remembers.
[slurps.]
God damn it! The whole point of the award was to put the past behind me.
But now, because of this idiot's dumb face, my past is all anyone's talking about! Everyone else was clapping.
Why couldn't you clap? Hey, man, awards show should've had better cheese.
My publicist is furious, by the way.
Ooh, spooky publicist! Hope she doesn't papercut me with her mad press release.
We're gonna handle this.
BoJack will go on TV and explain this unfortunate faux pas du fromage.
Won't you, BoJack? Ugh.
Fine.
Once again, hero BoJack will clean up everyone else's mess.
Hello, Todd.
Ooh! Did you notice how I just walked in without knocking? Pretty tough, huh? Not at all! To me, it read as amiable and familiar, like our friendship has an assumed "open door" policy.
God damn it! [thumps.]
Owie! Apparently, Hollywoo producers don't think I'm tough enough to play the bad boy parts.
Oh, no! Todd, you're the toughest guy I know.
[giggles.]
Will you teach me how to be tough? I thought you'd never ask.
Because I had no idea this was happening to you.
[audience applauding.]
[music playing.]
BoJack, clear the air.
Why'd you give Vance the face? Well, there was this cheese And you're lactose intolerant, which reminded you that Vance lacks tolerance? No, it The cheese stands alone, but no woman should stand alone, when standing up to sexual harassment? Squawk! No, it wasn't any of those things! So, you're saying it wasn't any one thing, more of an accumulation? It BoJack, it is really incredible, your taking a stand against your co-star.
No, I'm not taking any stand I mean, the guy choked his wife, and most of Hollywoo is, like, "No biggie.
Good for him!" Squawk! Okay, well, obviously it's not good he choked his wife.
Wow! [cheering, applause.]
No, no, no! I wasn't trying to make some bold statement or anything.
It's just that choking your wife is bad.
[cheering and applauding.]
Really? Okay.
Can I just tell you how amazing it is to hear a man say that? Well, Paloma, someone needed to take a stand.
[cheering and applauding.]
Call me crazy.
I mean, this is just old BoJack talking, but how about we don't choke any women? [cheering.]
So true, right? Don't choke women! [all chanting.]
Don't choke women! BoJack is right.
Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers, by allowing them to star in movies and TV shows, that play off their problematic personas! [audience.]
Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers by allowing them to star in movies and TV shows that play off their problematic personas! All right! Squawk! And speaking of battering women, right after the break, we'll show you how to make the perfect blueberry pancake.
With proud feminist, BoJack Horseman.
Stick around! And don't choke women! [chuckles.]
[signal buzzes.]
How is it you consistently do the opposite of the thing I need you to do? I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Is it possible, this whole time, I've been an amazing feminist hero, and nobody knew it? BoJack! Feels pretty right.
Yeah, I'm a male feminist.
You're welcome, society.
I gotta call Vance.
Okay.
I'm just gonna stay here, being woke.
Vance! Listen, BoJack's been very dehydrated.
No, no, no.
You can't use the old "dehydration made him stupid" trick on me.
Okay? I'm Mr.
Dehydration-Made-Me-Stupid.
BoJack really wants to work with you.
He just got caught up Doesn't matter.
I'm not doing the show.
What? You were right.
All it took was one offer.
Once word got out I was doing Philbert, all the other offers started pouring in.
You signed a contract! Oh, please.
I sexted a 12-year-old and still got a Humanitas Prize.
You think I can't get out of a contract, with a time website? By the way, still very sorry about sexting that 12-year-old.
[groans.]
Oh-hh! Hey, Princess Carolyn, you ever notice how, as a woman, you only make ten cents for every dollar your clients make? Really makes you think, huh? BoJack, I was wrong, you were right.
Let's take that asshole down.
So, now, you wanna take him down Now, that he's not doing your TV show, anymore? Diane, don't be cynical.
I'm cynical? What do you want me to say? I got blinded by my desire to see myself succeed, which, since I'm a woman, is actually very feminist.
But now that Vance can't help me succeed, I realize the more feminist thing to do is to make sure he doesn't succeed either.
I'm cynical? I'm offering an olive branch, here.
Look, this town loves assholes like Vance.
There's nothing we can do.
This town is as wishy-washy as a virgin on prom night.
All they need to listen to women is the right voice a man's voice.
[BoJack.]
Oh! Is that why I'm here? Yep.
I brought you two together because between your feminist brain and your stupid manly face, you can actually say things that people will listen to.
That's a good point.
People do listen to me all the time.
One time I tweeted "RIP David Bowie," and now everyone still thinks he's dead.
David Bowie is dead.
Wait, for real? Oh, man.
So, through BoJack, I can say whatever I want, to a huge audience, without being called "shrill," or "naggy," or "classic Diane.
" Yeah.
Everyone loves a male feminist.
It turns out, the problem with feminism, all along, is it just wasn't men doing it.
We're much less shrill.
Yeah, this is truly a great day for women everywhere.
[rock music playing.]
Okay, how do I make people think I'm a tough bad boy, who doesn't give a care about society's precious rules? Every time Vance Waggoner breaks the rules, it gets caught on camera.
That's it! We just need some video evidence of me being tough! Here, record this.
Ooooh! [phone camera beeps.]
[exhales.]
Hey, got one for me, toughie? Sorry, bud.
Not yet, you're not.
But you can bet your candy ass you're gonna be.
[Todd.]
Ooh! [stammers.]
What the? What do you say to that? Thank you.
So much.
Huh? Two weeks ago, we buried my father.
Lung cancer.
My baby girl made me promise I'd quit smoking, but I've been sneaking these suicide sticks this entire time.
No more.
That was my last cigarette.
[sweet melody music.]
Thank you, you sweet, sweet soul.
Mm-wah! You are truly a kind and approachable character.
And tough? Tough not to love, you big galoot! Oh, banana bread! [phone camera beeps.]
Okay, just [marker squeaking.]
[sighs.]
Okay, so, pop culture inherently normalizes things, and that power works both ways.
It can normalize things for good, like how dancing Ellen makes middle America less afraid of gay people.
But it can also normalize things for bad, like what Jack Bauer did for torture, or what Jimmy Fallon did for lip-syncing.
So, when we give a platform to known abusers like Vance Waggoner, that's an example of? Normalizing things for? Good or bad? I'm sorry.
I know you're trying really hard not to be boring, and it's kind of not boring, but it still mostly feels like I'm being lectured at.
Okay, well Hold on.
Let me imagine that I'm saying it.
You know what, that's a little better.
Well, the bar for men is depressingly low.
Just sprinkle in a few words like "intersectionality" or "micro-aggressions" and Vice News will name you Feminist of the Year.
Oh, should I wear a T-shirt that says "Feminism is Bae"? Girls love shit like that, right? [sighs.]
Sounds great, BoJack.
[door closes.]
Hello, Diane.
[yelps.]
How did you get in my car? You left it unlocked.
It's a Prius.
It locks automatically.
Priuses unlock automatically.
You still need to lock it when you get out.
Really? I know you and your little Scooby gang are plotting something against my client, and I want you to stop.
Ugh! Of course that dirtbag would hire Ana Spanakopita.
Vance has a troubled past.
All he's asking for is a fresh start.
No.
Why does he get that over and over? He's reformed.
What else would you have him do? Let's say, you can make him do anything you want to make things right.
What would you make Vance Waggoner do, now? Nothing.
I don't think he can make things right.
Well, then, what do you hope to accomplish, here? Can't you just admit to me, just between the two of us, that this sucks? You can say it's your job, that you believe in "forgiveness," whatever, but don't you at least a little bit think that when we let guys like Vance off the hook Diane.
when you, as a woman, give awful men the cover of your friendship, when you work for them.
First of all, they're not gonna get better.
Second of all, you are then complicit no, you're culpable for the terrible things they do.
Are you done? Just, woman to woman, can't you admit this is screwed up? You've given me a lot to think about.
[walking away.]
[remote chirps, lock clicks.]
Oh! So, in conclusion, is Smurfette a feminist icon? I think the better question is, why does she have to be?, We've gotten a little off track, here.
We were talking about Vance Waggoner.
Oh, yeah! We actually have a tape of a press conference Vance gave, earlier today.
What? And he mentioned you in it.
Oh, no, is this a Gotcha? Am I the gotcha? Let's see what he had to say.
I have an important announcement.
I am a feminist, too.
[applause.]
That's why I had to walk away from BoJack Horseman's new show Philbert.
Okay, I read the scripts they sent me, and I was outraged.
Gratuitous sexual violence.
Protracted, lascivious nude scenes.
Maybe BoJack Horseman thinks that's all in good fun, but I know it's toxic.
And if I took part in it, I would be complicit No, culpable for that toxicity.
BoJack, what do you say to those charges? Um The future is female? [chuckles.]
Pretty cool, huh? Uh, are you sure about this outfit? All the toughest guys wear leather.
Biker gangs, motorcycle cops, non-heteronormative dominatrices.
Well, this is the sleaziest, most dangerous dive bar in Hollywoo.
It's where all the bad boys party.
Charlie Sheen, Chris Brown, Subway Jared.
Great.
I'll waltz right in, fight a few bouncers, throw a drink in a face, and get this menacing mug on the cover of a few tabloids.
Hey.
[Peanutbutter.]
Hey! Bird brains! Why don't you snap some pics of me being mean? Get the word out that I'm a real tough SOAB! You? Tough? Yeah, right! Hah! I've seen tougher guys at the fancy-boy bubble bath parties I sometimes attend.
What? Sorry, I can't invite ya.
Fancy boys only.
Well, you two have a pleasant afternoon.
No, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Show 'em your tough stuff! Oh, yeah! [growls.]
[barks.]
[birds yelp.]
Oh, my God, are you guys okay? Did you hear that? No.
Exactly.
No more clicking.
You fixed my TMJ, which means no more wearing a night guard to bed.
Wow, I already feel like a more confident and assertive lover.
Thanks, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I'm gonna go home and make love to my wiiiiiiiiiiiiife! Uh My crossed eye.
It it's fixed! My depth perception is so much better now.
I'm gonna go watch a Wes Anderson movie and see if I can perceive any depth in iiiiiiiiiiit! And stay out! Whoa.
So did Philbert kill his wife? Well, Sassy thinks so.
That's why she's pretending to be his new partner, to get closer to the truth.
Meanwhile, his old partner Fritz is back in the mix, but he might be dead and just a projection of Philbert's lingering guilt.
Ooooh! That's very unclear.
Yeah, the whole thing's nonsense, but, more importantly, how do we prove it's not sexist? It is sexist.
No, of course.
But right now, I have to do an interview where I explain that it's not, because otherwise, I'll look like a hypocrite, which would be really bad for women everywhere.
So, in order to save feminism, you need to give me some smart-sounding reasons why Philbert isn't what it so obviously is, so that I can continue to be a hero and role model.
Everything Vance said about these scripts is true.
It's posing as a deconstruction of the edifice of toxic masculinity Uh-huh.
Toxic masculinity, yeah.
Right.
But it's just using that, as an excuse to relish in its own excesses.
And the most depressing thing is that ten times more people are gonna watch this show than read anything I've ever written.
I feel you're not really getting into the spirit here.
We can still take down Vance and topple the patriarchy.
Come on, we're doing feminism, it's supposed to be fun! This isn't fun for me! Being a woman is not a hobby or a pet interest of mine.
You get to drop in, and play Joss Whedon, and everybody cheers.
But when you move on to your next thing, I'm still here.
Okay, yeah, I totally get that.
But in the meantime, I just need to know what to say about this show.
Say whatever you want.
I have a listicle to write.
So, unless you can give me "five times Rihanna gave us life," this conversation is over.
BoJack Horseman is our Deep Dive guest, today.
So, what's going on? Something about your show being sexist? My producer printed out an article for me, but I did not read it.
Look, obviously, when you take plot points out of context, they can seem unsavory.
But they're all part of a larger attempt to deconstruct toxic masculinity.
Ooh! Sounds glamorous! No, we're not glamorizing it, that's the thing.
You're not supposed to like John Philbert or agree with the things he does.
It's a TV show.
It doesn't glamorize anything.
But maybe it normalizes it.
I gotta go.
Okay.
We still have 48 minutes, so, I guess I should just talk? [clicks.]
I was eight years old when my father first showed me his scars.
Each scar tells a story, and every story leaves a scar.
[tires screech.]
[yelps.]
Holy crap! Diane, the show needs your help.
What? You were right.
It's all the things you said it is, but it doesn't have to be.
Come on as a consulting producer.
Work with Flip on the scripts, make the show something that we can all be proud of.
Why would I do that? You said it yourself, more people are going to watch this show than read anything you write.
I'm giving you the opportunity to change society for the better.
Nothing I do changes anything.
No? You changed me.
[yelling, whooping.]
Listen up, scum.
[yelling stops.]
Huh? [woman grunts.]
There's a new sheriff in town.
And his name is Trace Norcutt.
Yeah, I read about him this morning in the metro section.
He just won a special election, right? Maybe so, but I [bartender.]
Wow! Thank you, sir, for keeping us informed about the comings and goings of our city politic.
After all, a democracy is only as strong as its populace is informed.
No, no, no, I was trying to Hey, let's cheer once for this kind stranger! Hip! Hip! [patrons.]
Hurray! I guess Princess Carolyn was right.
Huh, Todd? Todd? So, I guess the toughest thing of all was being tough.
Who are you talking to? Estelle.
Who's Estelle? Just Estelle.
You don't know her.
Not everybody needs to know everybody.
Hmm.
I have learned two lessons, today.
We still need to cast Philbert's partner.
No more bad boys.
We can't take another PR hit.
We need an actor who everybody loves.
Someone almost annoyingly positive.
Enthusiastic with zero baggage.
[phone beeping, meowing.]
You know who would be perfect? Uh Hey, Flip! Diane.
Yeah, you're the lady who's gonna make my show less sexist, right? Well, I'll see what I can do.
Here's what I need.
Sit in my office, don't chew too loud, and collect your paycheck.
Then, when the show comes out, people will see your name in the credits and say, "Huh, a lady worked on the show.
Guess it's not sexist.
" I can contribute more than that.
Not necessary.
Hey, thanks for being here.
You're really making a difference.
Uh [door closes.]
Hello, Diane.
[shouts.]
Jesus Christ! I locked the doors this time! I broke your window, because I needed to talk to you.
I have a phone! You were right about Vance.
He just got fired off his new movie after a drunken rant about the Chinese, and then plowed his Hummer into the side of the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.
Not the Chinese Theatre? Mhm.
Anyway, his career is over, for about two or three years, and then he'll be fine again.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm sorry, the last time I saw you I made things kind of personal.
No, no.
You were right.
We give these men cover.
And if we give them cover, we should know exactly what they're capable of.
In fact, I wanted to share this with you woman to woman.
[clicks.]
[BoJack's voice.]
She just walked in at the worst possible It wasn't my fault right? What is this? [woman.]
what you're talking about.
[BoJack.]
On the boat.
There was a girl.
What? In New Mexico.
And she trusted me.
Wha? I keep asking myself, if her mother didn't walk in, would I have done it? And part of me is sure that I I couldn't.
But another part knows that's a lie.
How do you make it right when you've made it so wrong, you can never go back? [music playing.]
Can't you see? You don't belong here! Destiny has bigger plans for you.
Oh, yes.
[woman on TV.]
But this is my home.
[rooster crows.]
It's the only home I've ever known! [voices.]
[man.]
You were made for the skies.
Why do you think they named you Amelia Earhart? It's because your heart belongs in the air.
[reciting Amelia's lines.]
It's true, that is my name.
Ah! Boots, leave your sister alone! She started it! Well, stop it right now or I'll pop the both of you.
So, put on those flygirl goggles, get in your biplane and fly to the sun.
[reciting.]
But a woman's never flown to the sun before.
Come on! What other gal's got the get-up-and-go to tame those savage sun beasts and become their queen? How many times have you watched this tape? When you get me a second tape, I'll watch something else.
What am I, made of tapes? [man.]
That's the spirit! [reciting.]
I suppose the most effective way to do it is to do it! [phone buzzing, meowing.]
[sighs.]
Hello? How the hell do they expect me to learn five pages of dialogue in one day? What am I, Young Sheldon? BoJack No show should have that much talking.
TV is a visual medium.
Anyway, where the hell are you? Eden, North Carolina.
Ugh, North Carolina? That's the second worst of the Carolinas.
You know I'm from here, right? Yeah, and you got out.
You know what "from" means? You don't have to be there anymore.
That's why they call it "from.
" Okay, I'm about to be from this conversation.
Wait, wait.
I'm sorry.
Can we just talk about Mr.
Peanutbutter? Why did you cast him on this show? Everybody loves him.
I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.
I'm Philbert.
Ugh! So then I got a food truck for the crew with a big sign that said, "From your favorite star," but everybody thought it was from Mr.
Peanutbutter.
They didn't even read the sign.
BoJack, I'm gonna be back tomorrow.
Do you think you can handle your shit until then? Oh, yeah, that sounds like me.
What are you doing there anyway? Just taking care of some family stuff.
[series theme music playing.]
Thanks for coming, all this way.
We could've just talked on the phone.
I wanted to meet you in person.
That's the Princess Carolyn difference.
Ooh! I've never met a person who had a difference named after them before.
Well, this is important.
We're here to talk about your baby.
I know what you're thinking; another dumb teenager, so liquored up, she forgot to make sure her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.
Well, that's all true, but I'm not some backwoods hick.
Oh! I'm 18, I got my whole life ahead of me, and it's not like my boyfriend's begging me to marry him.
Boyfriends rarely do.
His name's Strib, short for Dennis.
Uh, sure.
He's not exactly the romantic type, but he's got those eyes you just can't say no to, you know? I hope you and Strib have many happy child-free years, together.
I'm willing to do whatever I can to help contribute to the child-free part.
Hmm.
[phone buzzing, meowing.]
Oh, sorry.
It's work.
Everyone I work with is such a baby.
And I love babies! [laughs.]
Hello, baby.
Hey, listen, I know Flip just wants me to be "the woman", and keep my mouth shut, but this show makes no sense.
In the rooftop motorcycle scene, Fritz and Philbert keep saying, "This is so dangerous.
" "Yeah, man.
We're really dangerous.
" But then they just get off the motorcycles.
Why aren't they skidding towards the side of the building, and then they roll off just as their bikes go careening over the edge? Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.
Everything I pitch, he shoots down.
That's just because it's coming from someone who isn't him.
If you want him to like your idea, just convince him he thought of it, himself.
You really think he'll do it because I say it's his idea? That's a great idea, Diane.
Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.
So sorry.
No problem.
Um, just so you know, I have met with some other candidates, mostly couples.
Oh.
I couldn't believe I found someone who grew up in Eden.
When's the last time you were here? Oh, not since my mother died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.
She's still dead, though.
That is true.
[sipping.]
Sorry we had to meet at Phuzzy's.
I love Phuzzy's.
I bet you got fancy restaurants in LA, huh? Probably a California Pizza Kitchen on every corner.
Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen," since you're in California? No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen," or "CPK.
" CPK? What kind of city person's too busy to say "California Pizza Kitchen"? You gotta catch a bus or something? Stay a while and say the whole name.
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.
I live in Los Angeles now, but you know what they say, you can take the girl out of the Greensboro-High Point metropolitan area, but you can't take the Greensboro-High Point metropolitan area out of the girl.
I wish my boyfriend would've taken his penis out of the girl.
Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.
Yeah, no, I got it.
Thank you.
Ooh, have I missed this! I'm gonna eat the shit out of these hush puppies, and then tomorrow, I'm getting a real sausage biscuit, meaning a sausage patty, not that bullshit link situation they call "sausage" in LA.
[both laughing.]
Oh, my goodness, I gotta pee.
I'll be right back.
[grunts, sighs.]
[phone buzzing, meowing.]
Hello? Princess Carolyn! I just wanted to tell you what a ball I'm having on this crazy cop show.
Glad to hear it.
And my favorite star paid for a food truck.
I don't know why Peter Scolari is buying me a falafel plate, but, hey, I'm not complaining.
Did you have a question? Yeah.
So, I know my ex-wife is in the writers' room.
I don't want to make things weird for her or anybody else, so do I have to do all the dialogue, as scripted, or can I have a little fun with it? Um Normally, I wouldn't even ask, but because of the whole ex-wife of it all, I figured I should just double-check that it's definitely okay if I change every single word.
Knowing Flip, I would just stick to the script.
So, don't flip the script? Exactly.
Don't flip Flip's script.
That's a double-flip.
So, you're saying I should flip it? I'm saying the exact opposite.
So, flip it.
Flip it good.
Okay, I gotta go.
You're very funny and talented.
Goodbye.
Sorry.
Show folk.
Well, this was a pleasure.
Thanks for coming all this way.
I do hope to make a decision soon.
Oh, you have to leave already? Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.
Your booth? At the flea market.
I sell clothes I bought cheap and then bedazzled.
I'm not saying I'm the Danville Target or nothing, but it's good enough for fleas.
Okay, call me if you have any other questions.
I always answer my phone, day or night.
Thanks.
[bell jingles.]
[water dripping.]
[grunting, sighs.]
Your mom's drunk again, isn't she? My mom, well, obviously she was planning on cleaning the floors, but I asked her if I could do it.
I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade, so one day, I can be as good a housekeeper as she is.
Why do you still live here? Why don't you go live with your dad down in Raleigh? All my sisters and brothers are gone.
If I leave, my mom's got nobody.
Besides, if I go, who's going to keep you out of trouble? Did you know I'm on the football team? [chuckles.]
I do know it.
Are you ever gonna play? Probably not, smart-ass.
Not unless the first-string quarterback gets hurt.
Why aren't you the first-string quarterback? You're not even first-string housekeeper! Well, how about I first-string punch you in the nose? Oh! Okay, easy, easy.
Look, I think if I just keep my head down and be patient, Coach will eventually realize I should be QB one, you know? That's a terrible approach.
You need to go after what you want.
You gotta fly into that sun, like Amelia Earhart did.
What? You know, like in the movie.
I never knew anybody who liked old movies as much as you do.
You're 18.
You never knew anybody, period.
Okay, okay.
But what if I'm not as good a quarterback as I think I am? Doesn't matter.
You don't need to be good enough.
You just need to convince your coach you're good enough.
Damn! You know what? I'll talk to him tomorrow.
Don't leave until you get that yes.
[bell jingling.]
Oh! [panting.]
Sadie, wait! Oh.
Um, hey.
Listen, I really want to spend more time getting to know each other.
This baby, your baby, means everything to me.
I think the more time we spend together, you'll realize I'm [phone meowing.]
Do you need to take that? No, it's fine.
The perfect candidate.
I thought you always answered your phone, day or night.
Right.
Hello? I just got off the phone with Flip.
He's really excited about this new motorcycle stunt he came up with.
He wants to do it tomorrow, but That's Flip, full of ideas.
Gotta go.
Well, the show is already way over budget and my boss is starting to ask questions.
Now, normally, I love questions because they're good for pondering, but I guess in the corporate world, when people ask questions, they expect someone to answer them.
And, apparently, "Yeah, wow, it really makes you think," is not the kind of answer they're looking for.
Goodbye, Todd.
Wait, one more thing.
What? Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealous of Lake Superior? Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one? We've been through this, Todd.
Lakes don't have emotions.
What about Ricki Lake? As I was saying, I'd love to spend more time together, if you're up for it.
You mentioned the flea market.
I'd love to check it out.
Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
No, no.
I just have to prep for it today.
But if you can stay another day, that would be awesome.
But only if you can.
I know you're busy.
I don't want me, or my baby, to get in the way of your career.
Sadie, I'll be there.
[Sadie grunting.]
[engine starts.]
Toodle-oos! [laughs.]
[gasps.]
Ah! Oh! [phone dialing.]
Stuart, I need you to change my flight.
No, just do it through the website.
Yeah, no, go to the website and put in my confirmation number.
Hold on, let me see if I can find it.
It's 5-2-1-8.
Change it to a Wednesday flight.
No.
Oh, okay, click "yes.
" Click "yes.
" Okay, put in my credit card info.
I'll text you a picture.
[camera shutter clicks.]
[phone whooshes.]
Okay, did you get it? Check your work email.
Okay, click "accept.
" Now forward me the confirmation.
Thank you, Stuart.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
[deep breath, sighs.]
[Cooper humming.]
Ow! Hey.
Hey, yourself.
Well, you've been up to something.
I'm up to something, all right.
It's called first-string quarterback! [cheering.]
Really? I didn't leave until I got the yes.
Oh, congratulations! Ah! Oh! Oops.
[chuckles.]
Sorry.
I got a little carried away there.
That's okay.
[kisses.]
Oh! [gasps.]
Sorry.
Sorry.
That's okay.
[both laugh.]
[both moaning.]
[man on TV.]
By Jove, she's doing it! She's flying to the sun! That's where she's going.
Now we don't need to be sad when we think about her, later.
[mom snoring, TV playing.]
[switching off TV.]
I'd be careful if I were you.
What do you mean? Think I don't know what's going on? Mom.
Let me tell you something.
Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.
Everyone's got a number.
Some are winners, some aren't.
It all depends where the little white ball lands.
The problem is when people with losing numbers think they're winners.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then what the hell are these? College brochures.
I You think you're going to some fancy college in California, all the way on the other side of the country from your mother? You're gonna abandon me? Mom, it's not about you.
UCLA? No, you will not see LA.
Even if you get into one of these places, how're you gonna pay for it? I'll get a job or a paid internship.
Well, la-di-da, I did not realize I was in the presence of someone, who was gonna get a paid internship.
Mom, you need to go to bed.
See, that's the difference between you and me, Princess Carolyn.
I know where I belong.
This is my bed.
No, it's not.
Where's my bed? [phone buzzing, meowing.]
[mom, distorted.]
I know where I belong.
Hello? I thought you were gonna be here today.
Where are you? Something came up.
Okay, well, listen, Mr.
Peanutbutter's doing all his own stunts, and every time he does a dumb little somersault, everybody goes nuts like he's goddamn Kerri Strug.
Kerri Strug? You gotta update your references.
When the world sees the likes of Kerri Strug, again, I will adjust accordingly.
Anyway, I said I wanted to do my own stunts, too, but little did I know that Flip was writing a new scene, where a motorcycle falls off a five-story building.
Just say you don't want to do it.
I cannot do that because I already fired my stunt double, so I also need you to call him and get him back, and that might be tricky, 'cause I was really brutal about it.
Why? Because people were watching.
Now I need you to intervene and forbid me from doing my own stunts, even though I want to, because I actually don't want to, because that would require me to be in good shape, which we know I'm not, and also not a coward, which we both know I am.
BoJack Also, if you could say it's because I'm too important a star to take the risk on, but Mr.
Peanutbutter can keep doing his stunts because he is less important; that would be real cool, thanks.
Fine, I'll handle it! Just stop whining like a little bitch! [laughs.]
Okay, love you, bitch! [beep.]
Hey, girl! Hey! I'm so glad you came.
This is my stuff.
I call it Made-y by Sadie.
Wow! Problem is got a bunch of lookie-loos.
Everyone's browsing, but no one's buying.
It's not about people buying.
Ä°t's about you selling.
Watch this.
Whoa! Hey, you can't get that jacket.
Why not? I was gonna get it.
It's the best thing in this whole place and I saw it first.
So, why don't you make like yourself and flee? I got it now.
Maybe I'm gonna buy it.
[grunts.]
Five dollars.
[gasps.]
Oh, my God! Sadie, you can sell anything, if you just sell people the idea that they're not being sold to.
Wow! That's pretty manipulative.
But I didn't need to because your clothing sells itself.
Hey, I guess you're right.
[groans.]
My back aches.
I gotta sit down.
Oh! Here.
[bear growls.]
Smart move adopting.
Let someone else do all the work, right? [chuckles.]
Girl, you do not wanna be pregnant.
Ugh! What am I gonna do? My life's over.
No! Are you kidding? This is a good thing.
That boy's stuck with you, now.
Stuck with me? No, good stuck, like when you try on your friend's fancy ring and it won't come off.
Now you got a free ring.
You know, Evelyn still expects you to give that ring back.
That sounds like an Evelyn problem.
Meanwhile, that little white roulette ball just landed on your number.
You know the Wallaces are good people.
They're gonna do right by you.
[sobbing.]
No, don't cry.
Look.
They're gonna have you move into the big house, probably in the big room.
You know, the one with all the dolls.
And I'll be right up here whenever you need me.
Hey, I wanna give you this.
Did you steal this from Evelyn, too? Your grammy gave me this necklace when I first got pregnant.
It's been in our family for generations.
It's from the old country.
And when you wear this, I want you to remember that you've come from a long line of women, who've taken our licks, but we always land on our feet.
Don't we? [grunts.]
Now listen to me.
This is our shot.
Don't blow it, okay? [sniffles.]
Okay.
[Sadie.]
Princess Carolyn? Yeah.
Would you want to meet my family? Of course.
There's a potluck at the church, tonight.
I love a church potluck! Oh! What church do you go to in LA? Oh, uh, St.
Mary's Good Shepherd of the Lady of the Passion of the Constant Gardener of Latter-Day Belle and Sebastian.
You got time for that, but you can't say "California Pizza Kitchen"? I love church and I love the Lord.
God is my back-door pilot.
I wish Strib was a back-door pilot.
Maybe then I wouldn't be pregnant.
[chuckles.]
[whispers.]
Anal sex.
Got it.
[chatter.]
That's my mom.
That woman's been banged more times than a screen door during hurricane season.
Oh! But I love her.
That's my sister Tanya.
Thinks she's so smart.
If you're so smart, Tanya, why do you live on a dry-docked pontoon boat? Good one! She's got a great heart.
And, finally, the cousins.
I've slept with all of them.
Wow! I'm just kidding.
I'm from North Carolina, not Tennessee.
[laughing.]
Hope you like ambrosia, since everyone brought the exact same dish; ambrosia.
Ah, it's beautiful out here.
Look at all those stars! You don't have stars in LA? Not like these.
Too much light pollution.
And heavy pollution.
[Princess Carolyn shivering.]
[sighs.]
My dad's ready to see you.
[sighs.]
We better not.
[groans.]
[Mr.
Wallace clearing throat.]
Oh, I gotta tell you, when my idiot son told me he'd knocked up the help, I Let me try that again.
Princess Carolyn, we're going to do the right thing, here.
You'll have a lovely wedding before you start to show.
If it's a girl, we'll name her Dorothy after my mother.
Of course, if it's a boy, he'll be the third Cooper Thomas Rogers Wallace, so you'll call him Cooper III, or Cooper Three, Trip, Trey or Lil' Coop.
You'll join the Junior League, maybe sing in the Follies.
Mrs.
Wallace will teach you how to play bridge and destroy other families' social status through indelicate gossip.
Oh We'll go to Hilton Head every summer and take a photo of all of us on the beach wearing khaki and white.
This will be our Christmas card.
Inside, it will say "Merry Merry" or "Seasons Greetings," so as not to alienate our friends of other faiths, but we'll know it's Christmas.
Princess Carolyn, I know you're scared, but I promise you, you've got a great life ahead of you.
No worries, no tough choices and no money troubles, thanks to the Wallace and Sons Answering Machine Tape empire.
Yes, as long as people need answering machine tapes, you will be taken care of.
Sound good? Yes.
Ah, ah, ah.
Wait for the beep.
Sound good? Beep! Yes, sir.
[phone buzzing, meowing.]
[back to present time.]
Hello? Princess Carolyn, there's been an accident.
BoJack's hurt real bad.
Ow! I'm in so much pain.
I'm like Kerri Strug over here.
Where's my big Russian guy? What happened? He fell off a building is what happened.
Oh! Are you okay? I mean, I know you're not okay, okay, but you're okay, right? Why did you let him do his own stunts? That was today? Of course it was today.
I put a sticky on your day page at our sister site WhatDateIsItRightNow.
net.
Oh! Do you even check your day page? Every part of me hurts.
Sartre was wrong.
Physical pain is so much worse than prolonged emotional distress.
What a hack! We're supposed to be shooting, all week.
You're behind schedule and over budget.
I'm sending you the number of a specialist.
He can fix BoJack up and inject him full of enough pep to keep things together until end of production.
Sadie! [mother.]
No, no, no, no, Strib! [sister.]
Go away! So I call this number [phone beeps.]
Strib, what are you doing here? I mean, I guess I was wrong, maybe.
Maybe you don't give the baby away.
Like, maybe keep it.
I mean, I guess I could marry you.
Have a family and stuff.
I don't know! A grand gesture? This is like a fairy tale! Strib, I can't do this again.
Come on.
I love you or whatever.
Go to him, Sadie.
He loves you.
Don't listen to her, Sadie.
She lives in a pontoon boat.
Y'all gonna be beggin' for a ride when the flood comes.
Oh, my God.
Somebody gotta get him outta here.
[people arguing.]
Hey! Sadie? Sadie.
[voices overlapping.]
You blew it! We were this close, and you blew it.
[sighs.]
Mom.
What the hell happened? You eat a pineapple or something? Put something up there you shouldn't have? No.
It just I don't know, it just happened.
Miscarriages don't "just happen.
" This was our ticket.
That baby would've changed everything for us.
[sobs.]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry! [sighs.]
It's not your fault.
We just got losing numbers.
Well, maybe Cooper will marry me, anyway? Oh, sweetie, you've been watching too many of those old movies.
Coopers don't marry gals like you.
He's gonna end up with some fancy heiress, like Samantha Floppy-Disk.
Besides, you don't want that life.
You're free now.
Free to do what? I wasn't gonna tell you, but this came in the mail.
[gasps.]
[phone buzzing, meowing.]
Hello? I guess you heard about BoJack? Yeah.
This is all my fault.
I thought the stunt was Flip's idea.
Well, no, I just convinced him it was his idea.
That's not what I heard.
I heard it was Flip's idea.
Right, but that's just It was Flip's idea.
How are you not getting this? Do you only seem smart because you wear glasses? [sighs.]
Okay, it was Flip's idea.
Great.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I've known me some Stribs.
A little sweet, a little dangerous.
But the second things get complicated, he'll run away.
You don't know my Strib.
But I know you.
And you are too special to settle for the first guy who rolls up on a motorcycle and says, [drawls.]
"I love you or whatever.
" Well, I haven't decided what I'm gonna do yet anyway.
You're a bright girl, and you've got an incredible future.
Let me ask you something.
Did you really like the clothes I made? Of course I did.
Then why didn't you buy anything for yourself? Sadie You're bullshitting me.
This is just another sale for you.
No.
You think I'm stupid, but I've been watching you bullshit, everyone on that phone of yours.
I want to give your baby the best life, the best schools, the best opportunities You think, because you left her, you're better.
Because of your fancy show business, you can take whatever you want.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
Well, I got something you can't have, and no amount of your managing or producing is gonna change that.
I just want to help you.
I want to give your baby a better life.
Better than what? Better than a sky fulla stars? [sighs.]
[deep breath.]
Okay, Sadie, you do whatever you want.
You want to keep the baby, you want to give the baby to someone else, fine.
Just do, what you want to do.
Don't live your life for Strib, or this baby, or anybody else.
I know that.
Okay.
Good.
Thank you.
I mean it.
[sign grinds.]
[phone buzzing, meowing.]
Hello? So, I just got the word from Sadie.
She's gonna keep looking.
Okay.
Ugh! I'm sorry.
This is the hardest part of my job, when I have to lie to the clients and tell them it's not their fault.
Thank you, Tracy.
It's not your fault.
Goodbye, Tracy.
[phone beeps.]
[sighs.]
[chattering.]
[planes landing and taking off.]
[phone buzzing, meowing.]
BoJack, I am so sorry.
This was all my fault.
Uh, it's your fault I feel amazing? I don't know what that doctor gave me, but, man, you should leave town more often.
Hey, quick question is this a train? I'm on my way home.
I'll come check on you as soon as I get there.
Hey, I'm golden.
Let me tell you.
You accidentally drive a motorcycle off a building, and suddenly you are everybody's favorite guy.
We did it, Princess Carolyn.
Back on top! [phone beeps.]
[sighs.]
[announcer.]
Flight 29 to Los Angeles, say your goodbyes.
This is the final call for boarding.
[mom grunts.]
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
Ooh! Hey, I got a nutty idea.
What if you deferred for a year? Mom, I-I can't do that.
Of course you could.
Los Angeles isn't going nowhere.
Just another year.
By that time, Boots will be out of rehab, and he can come home, and help out.
Just wait until then.
Mom, please.
A year.
You'll hardly notice it.
No, Mom.
I gotta go.
Please? Can't you just do this one thing for me? I'm sorry, Mom.
[wind blowing.]
[shuddering.]
[vehicle approaching.]
[grunting.]
[panting.]
[tires screech.]
Yes, yes, I see you.
Get in.
Get in.
[music playing over radio.]
Your mother's having another one of her episodes.
Last night, she went to see A Doll's House with a couple girlfriends, and now she has ideas.
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon, to discover that not only had she not made me lunch, which is a meal I need in order to live, but she'd furthermore, locked herself in the bedroom to weep loudly.
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep, but when they do it at such a volume you can hear it through the door, then you know they're doing it just for the attention.
Anyway, I was able to cobble together a sandwich for myself, so, I'm the real hero of the story.
[horn honking.]
[tires screeching.]
It was a couple hours later when I realized I was on a good run with my novel.
I had this really interesting sentence that kept going for pages and pages, and I thought about how rare it is to really get in the groove like that.
How, most days, I can't concentrate because my idiot child is blasting the television, and it suddenly dawned on me; hot cock on a rock, she never even picked up the little noise and snot factory! [tires screech, horn honking.]
So, here I am, being your mother, which I know is giving you all sorts of mixed-up ideas about gender, while your brain is still loose and stupid.
Just remember, if you become a queer later in life, this isn't my fault! Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy," while gazing longingly at a tangled string of pearls.
Pearls are for ladies, BoJack.
Pearls are for ladies.
You know Sunday is my writing day.
Sundays are the one day that are just for me and my craft, and still, you and the black hole that birthed you conspire to ruin it for me.
What am I supposed to do now? Just go back to writing? I'm out of the zone now, the whole day's shot! All because of you and that brittle wisp of a woman you made the mistake of making your mother.
[sighs.]
No.
It's not her fault.
She's doing the best she can, after all.
It's just that you can't depend on women.
You can't depend on anyone.
Sooner or later, you need to learn that no one else is gonna take care of you.
That's what I learned when I had to make my own sandwich.
You can't rely on other people, BoJack.
It's good for you to know that.
And she's a good mother for teaching you that.
You've got a head start on most kids.
You're actually very lucky.
[music continues over radio.]
Thaaaaank youuuuu? [theme music playing.]
So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box, on the way here, and the girl behind the counter said, "Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?" Not, "How are you doing today?" No.
"Are you having an awesome day?" Which is pretty shitty because it puts the onus on me to disagree with her, like if I'm not having an "awesome day," suddenly I'm the negative one.
Usually, when people ask how I'm doing, the real answer is I'm doing shitty, but I can't say I'm doing shitty because I don't have a good reason to be doing shitty.
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty," then they say, "Why? What's wrong?" And I have to be like, "I don't know, all of it?" So instead, when people ask how I'm doing, I usually say, "I am doing so great.
" But when this girl at the Jack in the Box asked me if I was having an awesome day, I thought, well, today I'm actually allowed to feel shitty, today I have a good reason, so I said to her, "Well, my mom died.
" And she immediately burst into tears.
So, now I have to comfort her, which is annoying, and meanwhile, there's a line of people forming behind me, who are all giving me these real judgy looks because I made the Jack in the Box girl cry.
And she's bawling, and she's saying, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," and I'm like, "It's fine.
It's fine.
I mean, it's not fine, but, you know, it's fine.
And I would like to order a Double Jack Meal, and I've kinda got somewhere to be, so maybe less with the crying and more with the frying, huh?" [inhales.]
And the girl apologizes, again, and she offers me a free churro with my meal.
And as I'm leaving, I think, "I just got a free churro because my mom died.
" No one ever tells you when your mom dies, you get a free churro.
[people murmuring.]
[clears throat.]
Anyway, I'm sorry, that's not part of the [clears throat.]
All right.
Okay, here we go.
Let's do this.
Here I am, BoJack Horseman, doing a eulogy, let's go.
Hey, piano man, can I get like a, like an organ flourish? [organ plays.]
Nicely done.
You know, I was a little worried I wouldn't have the right accompaniment today.
I guess it's a good thing my mom was an organ donor! [rimshot plays.]
What happened to the organ? [horn "oogahs".]
Why don't you leave the comedy to the professionals? Okay? This is a funeral, sir, for my mother.
Can you show a little respect? [trumpet whines.]
I'll take it.
Beatrice Horseman, who was she? What was her deal? Well, she was a horse.
Uh, she was born in 1938.
She died in 2018.
One time, she went to a parade, and one time, she smoked an entire cigarette in one long inhale.
I watched her do it.
Truly a remarkable woman.
[rustling.]
Lived a full life, that lady.
Just, all the way to the end, which is, uh, now, I guess.
Really makes you think, though, huh? Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens.
Then you die.
Well, that's my time, you've been great! Tip your waitress! No, I'm just kidding around, there's no waitress.
That's all I have to say about my mother.
No point beating a dead horse, right? So [inhales.]
Now what? I don't know, Mom, you got any ideas? Anything? Mom? No? Nothing to contribute? Knock once if you're proud of me.
Can I just say how amazing it is to be in a room with my mother, and I can just talk without her telling me to shut up and make her a drink? Hey, Mom.
Knock once if you think I should shut up.
No? You sure? I mean, I don't want to embarrass you, by making this eulogy into a me-logy, so, seriously, if you wanted me to sit down and let someone else talk, just knock.
I will not be offended.
No? Your funeral.
Sorry about the closed casket, by the way.
She wanted an open casket, but, you know, she's dead now, so who cares what she wanted? No, that sounds bad.
I'm sorry.
I think that if she could've seen what she looked like dead, she'd agree it's better this way.
She looked like this.
[groaning.]
[mourners gasping.]
Kinda like a pissed-off toy dinosaur.
The coroner couldn't get her eyes closed.
So, now her face is forever frozen in a mask of tremendous horror and anguish.
Or as my mom called it, Tuesday! Tuesday! My mom called it Tuesday.
[woman coughs.]
Hey, Mom, what did you think of that joke? You like that? [woman coughs.]
You never did care for my comedy.
[clears throat.]
Here's a story.
When I was a teenager, I performed a comedy routine for my high school talent show.
There was this cool jacket that I wanted to wear because it would make me look like Albert Brooks.
For months, I saved up for this jacket, but when I finally had enough, I went to the store and it was gone.
They had just sold it to someone else.
So, I went home and I told my mother.
She said, "Let that be a lesson.
That's the good that comes from wanting things.
" She was really good at dispensing life lessons, that always seemed to circle back to everything being my fault.
But then, on the day of the talent show, my mother had a surprise for me.
She had bought me the jacket.
Even though she didn't know how to say it, I knew this meant that she loved me.
Now, that's a good story about my mother.
It's not true, but it's a good story, right? I stole it from an episode of Maude I saw when i was a kid, where she talks about her father.
I remember when I saw it, thinking that's the kind of story I want to tell about my parents when they die.
But I don't have any stories like that.
All I know about being good I learned from TV.
And in TV, flawed characters are constantly showing people they care with these surprising grand gestures.
And I think that part of me still believes that's what love is.
But in real life, the big gesture isn't enough.
You need to be consistent, you need to be dependably good.
You can't just screw everything up, and then take a boat out into the ocean to save your best friend, or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.
You need to do it every day, which is so hard.
When you're a kid, you convince yourself that maybe the grand gesture could be enough.
That even though your parents aren't what you need them to be, over and over and over again, at any moment they might surprise you, with something wonderful.
I kept waiting for that, the proof, that even though my mother was a hard woman, deep down, she loved me and cared about me and wanted me to know that I made her life a little bit brighter.
Even now, I find myself waiting.
Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me and care about me, and want me to know I made your life a little bit brighter.
[owl chirping.]
My mother did not go gentle into that good night.
She went clawing and fighting and thrashing, hence the face.
[groaning.]
[mourners gasping.]
If you'd seen her, I swear to God the only thing you'd be thinking about right now is that I am nailing this impression.
[woman clears her throat.]
[chairs squeak.]
I was in the hospital with her those last moments, and they were truly horrifying, full of nonsensical screams and cries, but there was this moment, this one instant of strange calm, where she looked in my direction and said, "I see you.
" That's the last thing she said to me.
"I see you.
" Not a statement of judgment or disappointment, just acceptance and the simple recognition of another person in a room.
"Hello, there.
You are a person.
And I see you.
" Let me tell you, it's a weird thing to feel at 54 years old, that for the first time in your life your mother sees you.
It's an odd realization that it's the thing you've been missing, the only thing you wanted all along, to be seen.
And it doesn't feel like a relief, to finally be seen.
It feels mean, like, "Oh, it turns out that you knew what I wanted, and you waited until the very last moment to give it to me.
" I was prepared for more cruelty.
I was sure that she would get in one final zinger, about how I let her down, and about how I was fat and stupid, and too tall to be an effective Lindy-hopper.
How I was needy and a burden and an embarrassment.
All that I was ready for.
I was not ready for "I see you.
" Only my mother would be lousy enough to swipe me with a moment of connection on her way out.
But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.
Maybe it wasn't about connection.
Maybe it was a Maybe it was an "I see you," like, "I see you.
" Like, "You might have the rest of the world fooled, but I know exactly who you are.
" That's more my mom's speed.
Or maybe she just literally meant "I see you.
You are an object that has entered my field of vision.
" She was out of it at the end, so maybe it's dumb to try to attribute it to anything.
[woman sighs.]
Back in the 90s, I was in a very famous TV Show called Horsin' Around.
[man coughs.]
Please hold your applause.
And I remember one time, a fan asked me, "Hey, um, you know that episode where the horse has to give Ethan a pep talk, after Ethan finds out his crush only asked him to the dance because her friends were having a dorkiest date contest? In all the shots of the horse, you can see a paper coffee cup on the kitchen counter, but in the shots of Ethan, the coffee cup's missing.
Was that because the show was making a statement, about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory and how even two people can experience the same moment in entirely different ways? And I didn't have the heart to be, like, "No, man, some crew guy just left their coffee cup in the shot.
" So instead, I was, like "Yeah.
" And maybe this is like that coffee cup.
Maybe, we're dumb to try to pin significance onto every little thing.
Maybe, when someone says, "I see you," it just means, "I see you.
" Then again, it's possible she wasn't even talking to me.
Because, if I'm being honest, she wasn't really looking at me, she was looking past me.
There was nobody else in the room.
I think she was talking to me, but, honestly, she was so far gone at that point, who knows what she was seeing.
Who were you talking to, Mom? [sighs.]
Not saying, huh? Staying mum? No rimshot there? God, whatever I'm paying you, it's too much.
Maybe, she saw my dad.
My dad died about ten years ago of injuries he sustained during a duel.
When your father dies, you ask yourself a lot of questions.
Questions like, "Wait, did you say he died in a duel?" and "Who dies in a duel?" The whole thing was so stupid.
Dad spent his entire life writing this book, but he couldn't get any stores to carry it, or any newspapers to review it.
Finally, I guess this one newspaper thought he was pretty hilarious, because they ran a review and tore him to shreds.
So, my father, ever the Proud Mary, decided he would not stand for this besmirchment of his honor.
He claimed the critic didn't understand what it meant to be a man, so he demanded satisfaction in the form of pistols at dawn.
He wrote the paper, this letter, saying anyone who didn't like his book, he would challenge to a duel, anyone in the world.
He'd even pay for airfare to San Francisco and a night in a hotel.
Well, eventually this found its way to some kook in Montana, who was as batshit as he was and took him up on the offer.
They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed: ten paces, then shoot.
But in the middle of the ten paces, Dad turned to ask the guy if he'd actually read the book and what he thought, but, not looking where he was going, tripped over an exposed root and bashed his head on a rock.
[murmur.]
I wish I'd known to go to Jack in the Box then.
I could have gotten a free churro.
It would've been nice to have something to show for being the son of Butterscotch Horseman.
My darling mother gave the eulogy.
My entire life I never heard her say a kind word to or about my father, but at his funeral she said, "My husband is dead, and everything is worse now.
" [clearing throat.]
"My husband is dead, and everything is worse now.
" I don't know why she said that.
Maybe she felt that's the kind of thing you're supposed to say at a funeral.
Maybe she hoped one day someone would say that about her.
"My mother is dead, and everything is worse now.
" Or maybe she knew that he had frittered away all her inheritance, and replaced it with crippling debt, which is a pretty shitty thing to leave your widow with.
"Bad news, you lost a husband, but don't worry, you also lost the house!" Maybe Mom knew she'd have to sell all her fancy jewelry and move into a home.
Maybe that's what she meant by "everything is worse.
" Is that what you meant, Mom? I gotta say, I'm really carrying this double act.
At least with Penn and Teller, the quiet one does card tricks.
Hey, piano man, when I say something funny to my mom, how about you give me a rimshot? [rimshot plays.]
Yeah, but not now.
When I say something funny.
Like, okay.
What's the difference between my mother and a disruptive expulsion of germs? One's a coughin' fit and the other fits a coffin! That's an example of a funny thing.
[rimshot plays.]
Thank you.
Let's try again.
Hey, Mom.
What's the difference between my mother and a bunch of Easter eggs? One gets carried in a basket, the other gets buried in a casket! [rimshot plays.]
Ready for one more? Last one.
What's the difference between a first-year lit major and my mother, Beatrice Horseman? One is decently read, and the other's a huge bitch! [woman gasps.]
[murmers.]
Might have gone a little too far with that one.
That one might have been a little too "my mom's a huge bitch" for the room.
I'm sorry, Mother.
You're not a huge bitch.
You were a huge bitch and now you're dead.
[woman sighs.]
You know, the first time I ever performed in front of an audience, it actually was, uh, with my mom.
She used to put on these shows, with her supper club in the living room, and she used to make [inhales.]
She used to make me sing "The Lollipop Song.
" [organ playing tune.]
Those parties, they were really something.
There were skits and magic acts, and ethnically insensitive vaudeville routines, and the big finale was always a dance my mother did.
She had this beautiful dress that she only brought out for these parties, and she did this incredible number.
It was so beautiful and sad.
Dad hated the parties.
He'd lock himself in the study, and bang on the walls for us to keep it down, but he always came out to see Mom dance.
He'd linger in the doorway, scotch in hand, and watch in awe, as this cynical, despicable woman he married took flight.
And as a child who was completely terrified of both my parents, I was always aware that this moment of grace, it meant something.
We understood each other, in a way.
Me and my mom and my dad, as screwed up as we all were, we did understand each other.
My mother, she knew what it's like to feel your entire life like you're drowning with the exception of these moments, these very rare, brief instances, in which you suddenly remember you can swim.
[flashback.]
[partygoers laughing.]
[classical music playing.]
But, then again, mostly not.
Mostly you're drowning.
She understood that too.
And she recognized that I understood it.
And Dad.
All three of us were drowning, and we didn't know how to save each other, but there was an understanding that we were all drowning together.
I would like to think that's what she meant when we were in the hospital and she said, "I see you.
" The weird thing about both your parents being dead is it means that you're next.
I mean, you know, obviously it's not like there's a wait list for dying.
Any one of us could get run over by a Snapchatting teen at any moment.
And you would think that knowing that would make us more adventurous, and kind, and forgiving.
But it makes us small, and stupid, and petty.
I actually had a near-death experience, recently.
A stunt went bad and I fell off a building.
I'm an actor.
I do my own stunts.
I'm on this new show Philbert.
I'm Philbert.
Star of the show.
It hasn't come out yet, but it's already getting Emmy buzz.
Oh, speaking of buzz [inhales.]
I've to take two of these every morning, but my days are so screwed up 'cause of the shooting schedule, I don't even know what morning means anymore.
There's a joke in there somewhere, about a guy who's been to so many funerals, he doesn't even know what mourning means anymore.
Let you guys figure that one out for yourselves.
[gulps.]
Anyway, you know what I thought when I was falling off the building and I went into panic mode? The last thing that my stupid brain could come up with before I died? "Won't they be sorry.
" Cool thought, brain.
[rimshot plays.]
No, that wasn't Would you just Dial it back, all right? I don't even know what "they" I wanted to be sorry.
My mom, even before she died, could barely remember who I was.
And of course, my dad's dead.
The last conversation I ever had with him was about his novel.
He was so certain this book was his legacy.
Maybe he thought it would vindicate him for all the shitty things he ever did in his stupid worthless life.
Maybe it did.
I don't know.
I never read it.
Because why would I give him that? I used to be on this TV show called Horsin' Around.
Seriously, hold your applause.
[man coughs.]
Well held.
It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz, who's also dead now, and it starred this little girl named Sarah Lynn.
And it was about these orphans.
And early on, the network had a note, "Maybe don't mention they're orphans, because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not relatable.
" I never thought the orphans were sad.
I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted.
They had something to long for.
Anyway, we did this one season finale, where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.
And she was a junkie, but she's gotten herself cleaned up, and she wants to be in Olivia's life again.
And of course, she's like a perfect grown-up version of Olivia, and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced, like she's always wanted and Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six finale of Horsin' Around, if you're still working your way through it.
Anyway, the horse tries to warn her, "Be careful, moms have a way of letting you down.
" But Olivia just thinks the horse is jealous, and when the mom says she's moving to California, Olivia decides to go with her.
And the network really juiced the cliffhanger: "Is Olivia gone for good?" But of course, because it's a TV show, she was not gone for good.
Of course, because it's a TV show, Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab, so Olivia had to hitchhike all the way home, getting rides from Mr.
T, Alf, and the cast of Stomp.
Of course that's what happened.
Because, what are you gonna do, just not have Olivia on the show? You can't have happy endings in sitcoms, not really, because, if everyone's happy, the show would be over, and above all else, the show has to keep going.
There's always more show.
And you can call Horsin' Around dumb, or bad, or unrealistic, but there is nothing more realistic than that.
You never get a happy ending, 'cause there's always more show.
I guess until there isn't.
[chuckles.]
My mom would hate it if she knew that I spent so much time at her funeral talking about my old TV show.
Or maybe she'd think it was funny that her idiot son couldn't even do this right.
Who knows? She left no instructions for what she wanted me to say.
All I know is she wanted an open casket, and her idiot son couldn't even do that right.
I'll stand up here and pretend I understood how to please that woman, even though so much of my life has been wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.
But I keep going back to that moment in the ICU when she looked at me, and "I-C-U.
" "I see you.
" Jesus Christ, we were in the intensive care unit.
She was just reading a sign.
My mom died and all I got was this free churro.
You know the shittiest thing about all of this? Is when that stranger behind the counter gave me that free churro, that small act of kindness showed more compassion than my mother gave me her entire goddamn life.
Like, how hard is it to do something nice for a person? This woman at the Jack in the Box didn't even know me.
I'm your son.
All I had was you! [inhales.]
I have this friend.
And right around when I first met her, her dad died, and I actually went with her to the funeral.
And months later, she told me that she didn't understand why she was still upset, because she never even liked her father.
It made sense to me, because I went through the same thing when my dad died.
And I'm going through the same thing now.
You know what it's like? It's like that show Becker, you know, with Ted Danson? I watched the entire run of it, hoping that it would get better, and it never did.
It had all the right pieces, but it just It couldn't put them together.
And when it got canceled, I was really bummed out, not because I liked the show, but because I knew it could be so much better, and now it never would be.
And that's what losing a parent is like.
It's like Becker.
Suddenly, you realize you'll never have the good relationship you wanted, and as long as they were alive, even though you'd never admit it, part of you, the stupidest goddamn part of you, was still holding on to that chance.
And you didn't even realize it until that chance went away.
"My mother is dead, and everything is worse now.
" Because now I know I will never have a mother who looks at me from across a room and says, "BoJack Horseman, I see you.
" But I guess it's good to know.
It's good to know that there is nobody looking out for me, that there never was, and there never will be.
No, it's good to know that I am the only one that I can depend on.
And I know that now and it's good.
It's good that I know that.
So it's good my mother is dead.
[gulps, sighs.]
Well.
No point beating a dead horse.
Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938, and she died in 2018, and I have no idea what she wanted.
Unless she just wanted what we all want to be seen.
[slurps.]
[blows nose.]
Is this Funeral Parlor B? [funeral music.]
[watch ticking.]
[woman humming.]
I know, I know.
I'm just glad you showed up.
The waitstaff was starting to get suspicious.
See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife! All right.
You're trying to embarrass me.
And I did.
And now I'm fine.
Hi, you.
Hi, you.
[kisses.]
Long day at the office? I lost them, Indira.
No.
In all my years of corporate mediation, I've never been unable to resolve a dispute before it goes to arbitration.
I'm Mary-Beth, the Mediating Maven.
I'm sure you helped them in ways you'll never even know.
I Don't therapize me.
[chuckles.]
But you're so easy! You make me feel like I'm actually good at it.
What's going on with you? It's been a tough week.
Tell me.
Mm I shouldn't talk about my clients.
Come on.
What if you changed all the names and identifying characteristics? Okay.
This is a story about Bo Bo BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.
[theme music playing.]
[writing.]
[Indira.]
So, it all started on Monday.
I was in a session with Diane a! Diana.
[Mary-Beth.]
Like Diana, Princess of Whales? [Indira.]
Exactly.
It's just so tough being Princess of Whales.
Like, I can't be all things to all whales.
You're deflecting.
I'm not! Let's talk about the BoBo tape.
What's the BoBo tape? She recently came into possession of an audiotape of her friend and co-worker, BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.
[BoBo.]
On the boat.
There was a girl.
In New Mexico.
And she trusted me.
Also, I'm a zebra.
What girl is he talking about? I don't know.
"Girl" sounds young, right? [scoffs.]
Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad, because, otherwise, why wouldn't he tell me? Diana, you are not responsible for the dysfunction of others.
I actually explore this in my book, Are You Responsible For The Dysfunction of Others? Spoiler alert: You're not! I just wish I could talk to him about it, but he's like an open sore.
Attention! As some of you might have heard, my mom died recently.
I know you're very concerned, but I wanna let you know it will not affect my work.
I'm here, and I'm doing fine.
I just want to focus on the show.
So, please treat this like any other day, and be extra-nice to me because I am a famous actor, not because my mom died.
[all murmuring.]
Thank you.
Good.
Yes, that's what I'm looking for.
Just go about your business.
That's good 'cause I don't want to talk about my mom.
Hmm.
[grunts.]
Hey.
Did you hear my mom died? Yeah.
But you don't wanna talk about it.
No.
Pretty weird she died, though, huh? Do you want to talk about it? No.
I'm just saying it's weird.
BoBo.
I am so sorry.
And I so don't wanna talk about it.
Obsessed with my mom much? You're the one with issues.
Uh I feel like he wants me to comfort him, but I'm still angry.
Maybe you could both use some space from each other.
Why don't you tell him you need to focus on your work? What work? Flippy won't let me do anything.
[dolphin voice.]
Flippy? Are you okay? [squeaking.]
Hey, what are we filming today? Why is there a submarine set? [squeaking continues.]
[Diana.]
Interior sub? Why didn't you just write "way"? Okay.
So, now we just need to come up with a scene that takes place in a submarine.
Okay.
Ah! Did you hear my mom died? [Indira.]
How about this? If he wants to talk, and you aren't can't confront him, tell him your therapist says you need space.
That's where I went wrong.
I inserted myself into her story.
Don't beat yourself up.
Remember what Doctor Janet said? [bells in accordance to stick.]
Tell me about your day.
You had a tough workplace mediation? Whoo! The problem with these two is they don't just work together.
They also live together.
[grunting.]
What a beautiful morning! [Indira.]
Wait, wait,, wait.
Hold on.
If your story can have Princess Diana, why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face? It's not actually Princess Diana.
She's just named Diana.
I've been picturing Princess Diana.
Okay, fine.
Tell me what happened with Emperor Finger-Face.
He lived in the same apartment as a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning in the shape of a woman.
Good morning, Emperor Finger-Face! Good morning to you, Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning! See you tonight? Afternoon.
I wanna talk to you, so I set a meeting through your assistant.
Have you seen my keys? Butter tray in the fridge.
I think I put them there during one of my night terrors.
I don't have time to go to the kitchen.
I'll just hotwire my car.
Hey, did you eat breakfast? No time for meals.
I just grab whatever I can, whenever I can.
Hold on.
I know you're a gal on the go, but even tangled fogs of pulsating yearning need to eat right.
I'll get something on set.
Pinky swear? [horn.]
Ow! I poked my face! I feel I'm having a hard time following the story because of how weird you made the characters.
The important thing is that these two have been living together for almost a year with virtually no drama.
In some ways, it's the most functional relationship either have ever been in! Oh, okay.
I guess that's not that weird.
Great! Now, back to the story of the fog and the hand! So.
What can I do you for? I have no workspace on set.
I was hoping we could allocate some money to get me an office.
Oh, look, here's the exact paperwork you need all filled out and ready to go.
Okay.
Just needs your signature.
Let me retrieve my pen.
Marvelous! Yep, I am currently gripping my pen inside my jacket.
Now to just pull it out and sign this document.
Just goes to show, you get what you need if you pull the right strings.
Strings? [gasps.]
It was you! What was me? The last string cheese in the apartment, I was saving it.
And you took it! And now you want me to give you an office? What?! I didn't take your cheese.
Uh-oh, are we having a work-related conflict? This feels like more of a you-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.
When I started here, I signed a contract that said, all intra-office disputes must be resolved via mediation, or failing that, forced arbitration.
Ugh! So, then I You're not eating.
I just I keep thinking about BoBo the Zebra.
Okay, what happened next with BoBo? Well, he wanted to get back to work, but since Flippy had writer's block, there was nothing for the actors to do.
How is there nothing to shoot? So, what, I just have to wait around, and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.
When I was on The Murder-Stoppers.
We had to shut down production because Nick Nolte wouldn't come out of his trailer.
He wasn't even on the show! He was in one of our trailers, and we couldn't get him out! Is it hard to write a script, Gino? "Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang.
I'm a tough guy.
My wife is dead! Did I kill her? Who knows? I'm cool.
" That was pretty good.
Can we just roll on that? When there's something to shoot, we'll shoot.
Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one out in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.
Nah, I'd just be thinking about my dead mom the whole time, which would either ruin it or Oh, God, what if it makes it better? I don't wanna know that.
You want me to just get you some pie? No.
Yes.
Okay, big guy.
[BoBo sighs.]
[sympathetic voice.]
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Mr.
Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread.
Really sorry about your mom.
No, it's fine.
I'm fine.
It's really fine.
It must be so hard to lose a loved one.
I, for one, never have.
You've never lost a loved one? When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.
What? In the country, where she could have plenty of room to run free.
Why would she wanna run around if she's old? You know, I never really questioned the logic.
My brother set it up.
I haven't been able to visit, but everyone in my family goes to that farm eventually.
Oh, dude, your mom's dead.
What? No.
She's at a farm.
After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.
A farm.
Where they don't have telephones, or the internet, and Oh, my God.
She's dead.
My mom is dead! [sobbing.]
Whoa! [BoBo groans.]
Oh, there There, there.
[Flippy squeaking.]
What's going on with this submarine? My therapist doesn't want me talking to you! What? My therapist, Dr.
Indira, says it would be good if you gave me some space.
Why would she say that? Don't know.
I'm just the client.
Her call, not mine.
I should go.
Uh Everybody? My dear mother has transcended this plane.
[all.]
Aw.
I am incredibly fragile and could use all the support I can get, so if everyone could pay a lot of attention to me, and ask me a lot of questions about my mother, and maybe tell me stories about your mothers, I think that would really make me feel a lot better.
Sure, Mr.
Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread! [man.]
So sorry for your loss.
This is a very healthy way to grieve.
[applause.]
Ugh.
So, a brief recapitulation: this is not a room for repudiation or condemnation over string cheese appropriation accusations.
Mediation is an invitation for open conversation, frustration de-escalation, and exchange of information, which, in summation, removes any justification for litigation involving this corporation.
Nobody was going to litigate anything.
That's fabulous, because you legally cannot.
Now, tell me about your journey into the woods of conflict.
Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th, I was excited to come home to some string cheese.
The very last one.
I'd been saving it all week.
All week until Wednesday? That is correct.
I measure my weeks Thursday to Wednesday.
Why would you Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning? Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.
I was gonna melt it down and then sculpt it into a Mozzarella Cinderella! But when I got home, my string cheese was gone! Doesn't mean I took it.
Tangled Fog, watch yourself.
Or I'll turn on this fan.
Well, this morning you said yourself that when it comes to eating, you just grab whatever you can.
Can we use "I" statements? [shouts.]
Ai, ai, ai! You took my cheese! You probably ate it yourself during one of your night terrors! We know you opened the fridge.
You put my keys in there.
I can't eat while I'm terrified.
That's why I'll never know the delicious crunch of Count Chocula.
[shudders.]
That still doesn't mean I took it.
You will both have a chance to Come on! We both know you drift around the apartment like you own the place.
It's my apartment! [shouts and thumps.]
And it's my cheese! Oh, boy.
[tires screech.]
[grunts.]
Who do you think you are? [gasps.]
Uh I'm Dr.
Indir I know who you are! You know how many therapists there are named Indira? Google filled in your last name for me.
Why did you tell Diana that she needed space from me? Would you like to have a seat? No, I don't wanna "have a seat," and here's why.
Therapists are manipulative leeches So, when Jerry Lewis mistook me for the valet, he was carrying so much pain I could never fathom.
Mm And that realization allows me to forgive.
Not for his sake, but for mine.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
How long was I talking? I hope that was cathartic for you.
You wanna come back same time tomorrow? Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.
Are you my new best friend? [sighs.]
Uh? Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hogging all the conversation.
There's definitely more to your story than mine.
Mine's more like a secondary story.
A B-story, if you will.
I have a feeling it will continue to offer a light alternative, as my story gets increasingly serious.
Let's continue to switch back and forth between our stories, pausing at their most interesting moments.
That feels like the most natural way to have a conversation.
Well, while I was talking to BoBo, Diana was trying to keep things together on set.
I thought it was my turn.
[gasps.]
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
[Diana.]
Okay, cut? [buzzer blares.]
Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?" I just figured, we've got all these people here, we might as well film some stuff.
Presumably something shocking will happen, and then if it does, we have a shot of you saying, [mimics Gino.]
"Oh, my God!" Makes sense.
Diana, can I talk to you for a sec? I know you're going through something, and need boundaries, but this isn't personal, it's about the show.
Ah! [Diana grunts, sighs.]
What is it? I lied.
It's a 100% personal.
What? But it's good! You're gonna like this.
Remember you said you needed space? Yes.
When you told me that, I didn't take it well.
Uh But I made a new friend, so everything is good now.
Oh.
Well, that's great.
I'm glad you think so because, fun twist, it's Dr.
Indira.
What? I'm seeing Dr.
Indira now, as a friend.
Dr.
Indira's my new friend.
No.
What? It's great that you would wanna talk to someone, and you should! But she's mine.
I really need her to just be mine.
Can you understand that? [sighs.]
Yeah.
Diana asked me not to be friends with you, so out of respect for her, I think it's best that I continue seeing you behind her back.
We can still do our lunchtime hang outs, but to cover our tracks, I'll compensate you for your time on the books.
Ît'll seem as if you have a client.
And, to be safe, we should invoke a therapist-to-friend confidentiality.
How's that sound? So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert, and sometimes when I wake up, I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me, or if I'm still dreaming.
[watch beeping.]
Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.
I'm just so glad that I can help break up your day of listening to whiny babies with some entertaining lunchtime convo.
Should I have told him what we were doing was therapy? On some level, he must have known what was going on.
What I don't understand is, if you knew Diana asked him not to see you I'm a therapist.
A doctor heals.
A DJ spins.
Jessica Chastain takes whatever gig Amy Adams says no to.
My job is to listen.
And at that moment, BoBo needed someone to listen.
I know the feeling.
Okay, we've been going back and forth for two hours.
Can we take a break? I gotta use the bathroom.
If I even can! Maybe it's just another hand down there! Guess I'll find out! Why not just say you took the cheese? Because I didn't.
You want an office, right? There's nothing wrong with telling a small lie to avoid a fight.
I do it all the time with my wife, Doctor, uh, Underwear.
Heh? I love your new hairstyle, honey.
Did you not like my new hairstyle? Oh! Um Back to my story All you have to do is tell Emperor Finger-Face what he wants to hear.
Fifty-nine cents worth of edible string for a brand-new office? Wouldn't you take that deal? So, turns out I can use the bathroom, but it comes out in tiny cubes! Hey.
I took the string cheese.
Ha, ha! I knew it! Wonderful.
So, she can replace the cheese and you'll give her an office.
We did it! Great! Let me just grab my pen.
But even if I did take the cheese Which you just admitted you did! Would I be in the wrong? I mean, it is kind of a "fair game food," don't you think? What? It's not like it's a sandwich.
Some foods are just widely understood to be up for grabs.
No.
You guys.
[Finger-Face.]
Okay.
Well, then let's make a list of fair game foods.
Grapes.
Fair game.
Eggs.
Fair game.
An unsliced pie.
Not fair game.
A sliced pie.
Fair game.
The last slice.
Not fair game.
Then let's also make a list of what's fair game to me in my apartment.
Oh, that's right, everything, you literal knucklehead.
Oh, ho-ho! That's a solid diss coming from a gas.
Please, you two, we can still reach an agreement.
I don't know.
I think this might go beyond simple mediation.
No! Damn it, we're going to arbitration! [shouts.]
Nooooooooooo! Hey, Flippy.
I got everyone saying, "Oh, my God.
" How's it going in here? "Interior sub.
Philbert.
Philbert.
Flap, flap, flippy, flap.
Fart.
Barf.
Barf me a river, fartbag.
" [squeaking.]
What's going on in here? [squeaking continues.]
If it relieves any pressure, I don't know that everyone thinks you're a brilliant genius.
I think we need to simplify.
Let's start with Fritz.
Is he a ghost or is he not a ghost? Can't he just be a ghost? So, why is Philbert seeing a ghost? Maybe he feels haunted? And Fritz represents that? What is haunting Philbert? That's great.
But also Maybe something involving a submarine? You keep thinking.
Hey, are we about to shoot something? I'm meeting a friend for lunch.
You don't know her.
It's gonna be a while still.
Flippy is working through his "process.
" And I am helping.
Sounds good.
Just remember, you are not responsible for the dysfunction of others.
What? I'm just saying don't let him get you down.
Where did you hear that? About the dysfunction of others? I don't know.
Just around.
It's a thing people say.
[Diana.]
Mm Hey, are we gonna get new pages today or what? W-w-wait, did you say "Princess Carolyn"? I'm sorry, "Priscilla Crustacean.
" Vamanos, on the pages, okay? I've been here all day today, Wednesday, October 24th, waiting for something to shoot.
Andele, andele, andele! I think your Priscilla Crustacean is the same person as my Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning in the shape of a woman! And if she was on set all day Wednesday, that means Bu Hold on, I'm getting to the juicy part.
As soon as I get the thing, I don't want it anymore.
It feels cheap.
So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.
[Diana grunts.]
Emotionally naked! I knew it! Diana! Let me explain.
How long has he been your client? Not a client.
Three Days.
Friends for three days.
I asked you not to see her.
I asked for one part of my life that I could have to myself.
News flash, you're not the only one going through shit.
Maybe if I could talk to you, I wouldn't need to be looking for other friends.
Diana, is there anything you'd like to discuss with BoBo? We can do it right here.
This is a safe space.
No.
This doesn't feel like a safe space anymore.
I can't keep coming here if I know you're also seeing him.
Then it sounds like our time together is done.
What? You're setting a boundary.
It is good.
Go forth with the tools I've given you.
Live your life, Diana.
Like a candle in the wind.
I can't believe this is happening.
I think BoBo needs me more.
Would you like validation? No.
Your validation is worthless to me now.
You two deserve each other.
[grunts.]
Oh, you meant parking validation.
I actually would like that.
Wow, I can't believe you chose BoBo over your client of seven years.
At a certain point, I can't hold myself responsible for other people's dysfunction.
I mean, that is kind of your job.
But at least now you can help the Angsty Zebra, right? Well Okay.
Now for the real work to begin.
Real what now? You did the hard part, admitting you need help.
Did I admit that? And now comes the even harder part, getting the help.
Let's talk about your mother.
You know what? This has been great.
I got what I wanted and I made so much progress! So, I think I'm done? Yes.
You did it! I You changed my stripes! Dr.
Indira, you're great at your job! Goodbye forever.
W-w-w-wait! I can't believe I lost two clients in one day.
You're focusing on the negative.
I'm sure you helped them in ways you'll never know.
This area's all mine.
This is fair game.
Ya see the line? What about popcorn? Popped is mine.
Unpopped is fair game.
[ringtone playing.]
[phone beeps.]
Hello? [Mary-Beth.]
Todd.
Princess Carolyn was on set all day, the day of the string cheese theft.
She was not home when the cheese went missing, rendering any arbitration agreement made under those conditions null and void.
Whoa! Thanks a lot, Mary-Beth.
Just doing my job, kid.
A doctor heals.
A DJ spins.
Bryce Dallas Howard takes the gigs, Jessica Chastain says no to.
And Mary-Beth mediates.
So, it sounds like you didn't take my string cheese.
That's what I've been saying! I don't even know why we had to go through corporate mediation in the first place! I guess I just wanted it to be a workplace dispute, because I thought if you knew it was a roommate dispute, you might kick me out.
I'm not gonna kick you out.
I like having you around.
Oh, really? Who else would I get to keep my keys cold? You know, I have this job now.
Maybe I could start paying, I believe it's pronounced "roaunnt?" Rent? Well.
That's a great idea.
But I also need my own space.
Which is why I wanted that office.
Well, then, let's get you that office.
I just need to grab my pen.
Hey! Ugh! Hey.
I want to apologize for my behavior at Dr.
Indira's.
Don't worry about it.
She was right.
You need her more than I do.
And I think she can really help you.
Help with what? I was looking for someone to hang out with during my lunch.
I didn't want some psycho-babbling quack job telling me to get in touch with my feelings.
Who needs that? I do.
I need that.
You don't anymore! She said it herself, you're fixed! And then after you left, I was like, "Hey, if Diane doesn't need this, I don't need this.
" Wait, you quit? Yeah, I'm not someone therapy works on.
I might be too smart.
Oh, my God.
You haven't changed at all.
Whoa, whoa.
Diane, no, no.
I'm not the problem here.
None of this would have happened if I felt like I could talk to you, my friend, after my mother died.
So, would you like to talk about your mother? No, I'm just saying as an example.
Why do you bring things back to my mother? I can't keep playing this game with you.
You say you wanna get better and you don't know how.
Well, here's me, your friend, telling you how: get therapy.
Otherwise, don't waste my time.
Uh, you heard Dr.
Indira.
She said we don't need her.
She said I don't need her! I know, but you're just as screwed up as I am.
So, if I am not as screwed up as you are.
Diane, it's me.
Come on.
We're the same.
[gasps.]
We are not the same! [Diane grunts.]
Whoa.
[Diane huffs, hums.]
[typing.]
Whoa.
That's good stuff.
We're doing it, Diane.
We're doing it! I wanna thank everyone for being so kind this week.
Losing a mother is not easy, but I am so lucky to have the support system of my Philbert family.
You know who I really feel bad for is my dad.
He's out on that farm all by himself, and Oh, my God.
My dad is dead! [all.]
Aw.
Cheer up, everyone! We got new pages! All right! We're gonna film in the living room with Philbert and Sassy Malone first.
We're moving into the submarine for the flashback.
No time to learn lines.
We gotta make up for the lost days, so we're gonna put the whole thing on cue cards.
Let's go! All right, everybody stand back.
[murmus.]
[sobbing.]
We need lights on the living room! And action! Tell me what happened in the submarine, Philbert.
We were doing a routine submarine sting operation.
Things got outta hand.
Hey.
Who do you work for? Well, I sure as hell don't work for tips.
[chuckles.]
[men gasping.]
Okay.
Hey, Fritz.
Be cool.
Everybody cool.
We are in a pressurized submarine in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle.
Mm.
Easy [inhales.]
[all gasping, grunting.]
[gunfire.]
Oh, my God! You killed them all? We had to.
These poor guys.
I wonder if they had kids, families who will never know Can you just say the lines, please? Barf me a river, fartbags.
We gotta make this look like an accident.
You grab the contraband, I'll set up the explosives.
[panting.]
[BoJack.]
I went to the room where they were keeping the stuff.
Only there was no stuff.
Oh, my God! There was a girl there.
She couldn't have been older than 17.
Bring in the girl! What? What is this? Keep going! We gotta get this tonight! [Gina.]
A girl? [BoJack.]
They weren't smuggling drugs.
They were smuggling her.
Hey.
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
Just do the scene.
[Bojack.]
I told her it was going to be okay.
And she kissed me.
Wha? What did you do to her, Philbert? Nothing.
Like I said, she kissed me.
Kiss her back.
What? We need to get you kissing her back.
What? Kiss me, you idiot.
Kiss her! [both moaning.]
This whole thing is gonna blow.
We gotta bounce, friendo.
If Fritz hadn't come, what would you have done with the girl? [Bojack.]
Part of me is sure I couldn't go through.
But another part knows that's a lie.
We can't just leave her.
[whimpering.]
Use your brain, Philbert! Malone, you gotta believe me.
I'm a good guy.
If I'd known she was there, I never would've Tell me what happened.
I'll be back.
You wait right here.
Come on, loverboy.
You kissed a young girl and then left her to die.
I'm a good guy.
I didn't know that she was You have to understand, I'm a good guy.
She trusted you.
How do you make something right when you've made it so wrong, you can never go back? How did you come up with all this? It's a story I heard once.
I just changed all the names.
I'll never forget that night on The U.
S.
S.
New Mexico.
Why are you telling me all this? It's just good to have someone to talk to.
[Flip.]
Cut! [buzzer blares.]
Amazing! I'm a genius! [music playing.]
Halloween.
Fright Night.
Spook-tober 30-cursed! Oh, there's the light switch.
I'm still getting used to this new house.
I just bought it and it's the '60s! No, I'm just kidding! It's 1993, and I'm wearing a costume! Groovy threads! But you just got drafted, hippie! Hmm? Into the cutest husband army! [laughs, moans.]
Aw! Where's your costume? Can't I just wear a dumb hat and say I'm Blossom? In my opinionation Yes.
I am so excited to go to a real Hollywood party with my husband the TV star.
Just do me a favor and don't leave me alone, okay? Okay! Now hurry up and finish getting ready.
I'm kidding.
Can you imagine if I spoke to you like that? I really can't! Next time, we're doing a couples costume, though! It's the perfect way to tell the world that you are completely on the same paaaaage? What are you wearing? I thought we were going as Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in the this-year 2004 hit film The Notebook.
OoÎ¿Î¿Î¿h! You just said, "The Notebook.
" I thought you were gonna be, like, a pen or something.
The important thing is we both look super-cute, and everyone is gonna be, like, "Hey, is that Jessica Biel from the upcoming Blade: Trinity?" And I'll say my famous Blade: Trinity catchphrase, "Stop goofin' around, Blade!" Are you sure you're gonna be okay at this party? Whenever I went with Katrina, we'd always end up in a big fight.
Well, I'm not Katrina.
This is gonna be fun.
Okay.
I just know you're afraid of mummies.
And since it's Halloween, we might see some mummies.
I'm not afraid of mummies.
I just don't like them because of an incident from my past.
Will you stay on the lookout and keep those creepy corpses away? I'll be sure to make a mental note of it! I'm a notebook.
I'm not sure I get our costumes.
You're the guy from The Hangover.
The first one, which just came out this year.
Why did I say "first one?" There's only one Hangover movie, and it's 2009.
And you are? Your Baby Bjorn Borg.
Famous '70s tennis player! And what's with the robot stuff? Borg.
From Star Trek? And you're also a baby? In The Hangover, the guy had a Baby Bjorn.
Baby Bjorn Borg.
Seems like a lot of explaining.
People will get it.
Anyway, we are going to have fun at this party! You said BoJack Horseman is gonna be there? Oh, my God.
I'm so nervous.
I'm not! Every Halloween party I went to with one of my ex-wives, we'd get in a huge blow out.
I am so relieved that you are fun and easygoing, so there's no danger of that happening! Mm-hmm I love that we both love parties.
But more than that I love you.
Aw, I love you, too.
And I love these costumes! But tell me one more time, what are these costumes? We're new social media app sensation Tweed Feed! It's Insta plus Snapchat if they both boinked Friendster, which I guess was a thing in the '70s? [chuckles.]
Believe you me.
This party is going to be dope.
Booyah! It'll be off the heezy fo' sheezy.
OMG, it's gonna be cray-cray! Turnt! This is going to be the best Halloween ever! [theme music playing.]
Wow.
My first fancy Hollywoo party.
"I'm ready for my close up!" Nice! Sunset Boulevard? I usually take Fountain.
BoJack must really love Halloween if he has this big bash every year, huh? Oh, yeah, he's a real fiend for the 'ween.
[doorbell rings, horse neighs.]
Who are you and what are you doing here? [chuckling.]
Good one! Pretending not to know your old friend Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Why are you at my house? Remember when I invited you to my Halloween party, and you said, you'd love to come, but couldn't because you were having your own Halloween party? Oh, right.
Well, I'm sure my guests will show up any minute, so, you should probably go.
Well, I figured, "Hey, why not have a crossover party?" So, I brought my party, wait for it, to you! That was the first ever "Wait for it!" It's 1993! Uh Come on in, guys! [cheering.]
[music playing.]
Um [doorbell rings, horse neighs.]
God damn it, why are you here? At the end of last year's Halloween party, you said, "Let's do this again next year," like you've said at every Halloween party for the last 11 years! [cheering, whooping.]
That does not sound like me.
Oh, no.
Mr.
Peanutbutter? Partygoers? No.
Is it Sure is! Happy "Your 25-Years-Running" Halloween Party! [cheering.]
Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween! No.
Don't.
Please.
Don't.
No.
You see So, we're having a party? Why didn't you say this was happening? Because I hate that it happens.
I take no action to make it happen.
Every year, I pray that it won't happen, and it keeps happening anyway! I feel like an idiot being at a Halloween party without a costume.
Who cares? I don't have a costume.
Uh, you're wearing a costume.
Do you mean, in the sense that we all wear costumes, such as we reveal facets of ourselves to those closest to us, but our truest selves remain hidden? No, in the sense that you are literally wearing a costume from the TV show we both work on.
Oh, yeah! I'll go to Rite Aid to see what I can arrange.
Don't let the party end before I get back.
I definitely will let it die down! Oh, shit, the Halloween party.
[guests chattering.]
[music playing.]
Oh.
Hey, careful with the I'm sorry.
Can you put a coaster [doorbell rings.]
Can someone? You! Marv's intern! [grunts.]
You're on door duty.
You got it! [glass shatters.]
I'm very good at opening doors.
Do you have any candy for trick-or-treaters? No.
I don't know.
Just hand out these Emmy screeners.
I'm on it.
Those kids'll be holding out their hands for Franz.
Why grip a Twix when you can Sip-o-wicz? What? I don't Just keep answering the door until I tell you to stop.
You got it, chief! [doorbell rings, horse neighs.]
Diane! What are you supposed to be? An annoyed writer who hates Halloween.
Well, you are nailing it.
I'm just here to drop off pages for BoJack.
How's the party? I wouldn't know.
I'm stuck on door duty, like always.
[doorbell rings, horse neighs.]
Trick or treat! No.
You are way too old to be trick-or-treating, and way too young to be a guest at this party.
Oh, no! Why did I give you the option of trick or treat? I just wanted treat! Come back when you're five years older, or three years younger.
[doorbell rings, horse neighs.]
How 'bout now? Okay.
Come on in.
Whoa! Cool house.
Oh, thank you.
It's not mine.
It's my boyfriend's.
Really? Why does he make you answer the door? No, he doesn't make me, he's Oh, my God.
You're right! What am I doing? What am I doing with my life? Uh, well, judging by your outfit, I'd say you're a pilot of some sort? I moved to L.
A.
when I was 18 and now I'm 35! Everything's happening so fast! Oh, no! I'm 18! Am I going to be 35 soon? That's when they make you president! I don't want that! That's too much responsibility! I can't do this anymore.
You! Take my shift! Oh, no! The responsibilities are already starting! I gotta live my life! I deserve to be adored by a man, yet here my dreams lie dormant! I don't mean to get mordantly morbid, but did I get all adorably adorned to get bored manning doors? No more! Okay, this cider has not been sufficiently alcoholed.
If I'm trapped here with all you losers, I'm at least getting drunk.
[sips.]
Whoa! God! I think somebody spiked the cider! [chuckles.]
Well, I guess one drink won't hurt.
No, I get that it's the X-Files.
I'm just saying, what happened to the "A" through "W" Files? I wanna see that show.
More files! Hey.
Oh, hey, there you are! Sweetheart, you disappeared while I was in the bathroom.
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just got distracted by the fun party.
But I will not leave your side agai Oh, my God, is that Erica? No, no, please don't go talk to Erica.
Katrina.
Erica doesn't know anybody else at this party.
It would be rude to leave her all by herself.
Well, can I at least come with you? You know Erica can't talk to two people at once on account of her split-brain procedure! Why don't you go talk to, uh the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off? Ben Stein? I'll bet that famously boring man is a blast at parties.
I'll be right back.
No, don't Erica! Love the costume! Where did you find such a hideous? Oh, my mistake, I'm so sorry.
Ugh! Are you sure this is a good idea, 13-year-old Todd? It's part of the Halloween Code.
If you don't give teenagers candy, they're going to TP your house.
Okay.
[grunts.]
[grunts.]
[grunts.]
Okay, I've scoped out the party, and I've yet to see a single mummy.
As Margaret Thatcher's children often asked, [imitating child.]
"Is Mummy coming to see us?" [normal.]
And as their nanny always replied, [British accent.]
"Not tonight.
" Thank god.
[normal voice.]
I have to ask, what is the deal with the mummies? Okay.
I auditioned for The Mummy movie.
The one with Brendan Fraser? Ooh! And I thought everything was going well, and then something really traumatic happened.
Oh, my God, what? I, uh I didn't get the part.
That's it? You just didn't get it? I really wanted it! And it still haunts me! It's my one major career disappointment as of 2004, so could you please do me this one thing and make sure I don't see any mummies? I promise.
No mummies.
Remember that time that lady freaked out 'cause she saw a mummy? [BoJack and Pickles laughing.]
Who was that lady? Uh, that was actually Jessica Biel.
Who? [chuckles.]
One of my ex-wives? Oh, yeah! You've brought so many wives and girlfriends to these parties, I cannot keep track.
Well, don't forget about Pickles, huh? Uh, what? Why is the waitress here talking about pickles? Somebody order pickles? No, BoJack, this is my girlfriend.
Her name is Pickles.
You can remember because if you look at me, and don't recall my name, you'll think, "Who is this person? I'm in a real pickle!" And then just know that my name is like the thing that you're in, but with an "S" at the end.
What? I'm Pickles! My last name is Aplenty! Do I need to know this one? Is she gonna be around for a while? [chuckles.]
I like that you're razzing me.
It really makes me feel like one of the gang.
If he teases you, that means he likes you.
What? Is that what people think when I tease them? [gasps.]
[sighs.]
Cool.
Remember the year that Pinky won the costume contest, but then it turned out he'd just lost all his belongings in a fire, and those clothes were all that he owned? [laughing.]
[gulps.]
That was classic! Oh, shit, I gotta go run the costume contest.
Ow! My back! Why'd I do that? It sounds like you all have a lot of history.
Yeah.
I can't believe we've been doing this party since '93.
That's the year I was born! I did not realize that! [chuckles.]
Hey, cheers! [gulps.]
[Diane sighs.]
Are you having fun? Yeah, I'm having a great time explaining my costume to people over and over again.
Hey, here's a thought: if you don't get someone's costume, you don't need to tell them! Just live your life! Do you wanna leave? No, no, no, no! I'm fun! I don't want to leave! [chuckles.]
I wanna leave! Who has the yellow military assault vehicle blocking me in? Oh, that's me! Since when do you drive a Hummer? Company car.
I just like it 'cause it matches my hat.
Plus, lots of room for the golf clubs, and, boy, does that kitten purr.
Why don't you take her out for a spin and see how she handles? What is his costume? Diane! Hi! Hey Am I on the hit Priscilla Barnes vehicle Three's Company right now, because three's company.
I'm just trying to get out of here.
Oh, my gosh, Diane, I just want you to know that I know that you and Mister have a history "Mister?" And I'm fine with it, and there's no reason we should be awkward around each other, or jealous, you know? I'm not jealous of you.
Okay, good.
I'm not jealous of you either, even though you are really intimidating.
But if we were jealous of each other, that would be very normal, so either way, it's totally cool.
Totally cool.
[hiccups.]
Should we do shots together to, like, celebrate how normal we're being? Yeah, this is a good situation.
Okay, bye, Diane! Did I screw up? I'm so stupid.
No.
That's just Diane.
She doesn't like parties and she hates fun.
Oh! No, that's not fair.
She used to be fun.
In fact, when we first started dating, my favorite thing about her was that she was so much more fun than my other ex-wives.
Oh, we're talking about your exes again! That's great.
Of course, Jessica used to be fun, too.
That's why I started seeing her after Katrina because Katrina was so mean and cynical, and Jessica was sweet and full of life.
Yeah, she sounds awesome.
But, actually, now that I think about it, when I first met Katrina, she was also full of life.
Do you want another drink? I'm going to get another drink.
Oh, my God.
What a weird coincidence.
Why do all these idealistic, vivacious women eventually turn bitter and cruel after being with me? What's the common denominator? [guests chattering.]
[laughter.]
Ugh.
[sighs.]
Hey, buddy.
Ugh.
The conga line leader accidentally led us right into the pool.
I've never felt so alive! You should've been there! I want to go home now.
What? But this party is so fun! It's not fun for me.
'Cause I don't know anyone here.
Of course you do.
Just BoJack! You remember my wife Katrina.
Huh? No, I do not.
This is going great.
I'm gonna go dry off.
You two chat it up.
No, Mr.
Peanutbutter, please.
[exhales.]
Thank you for hosting this party.
So fun.
What's the story on the hat? It's a Blossom costume.
Oh, shit, that's right! It's Halloween.
I need a costume! Good call, stranger! Ugh.
So, I love parties, as you know, but maybe we should go soon? There are so many famous people here, it's actually making me kind of anxious.
Diane! Famous people are just like you and me.
Well, like me, because I am one.
Mom? No, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you tomorrow? Or is this the one night a year you emerge from your crypt? Go introduce yourself.
I'm sure he'd love to meet you! Or we could just go home? No, come on.
It's Halloween, a night to face your fears.
That's why they call it Halloween! So, you can wean yourself off of having fears! Say "Hallo" to weaning! [Diane whimpers.]
Okay.
Todd's Hummer is now blocked in by a blue Tesla.
I'm looking for the owner of a blue Tesla.
Studies say buying used is actually better for the environment, but, hey, you tried, and subsequently trapped me at this party! [both.]
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
So, thanks for the new script pages.
You got it.
Hey, listen.
That submarine scene You wanna talk about it? No? Okay.
We'll just put that in the large bucket of things we don't talk about.
What is that supposed to mean? That you didn't wanna talk about it.
[groans, grunts.]
[gulps.]
This party sucks.
Hey, doorman! I don't have a costume.
And I don't wanna look stupid at my own bitchin' Halloween party.
Okay, I've got an idea.
There.
You're a one-night stand.
Get it? Nightstand? Nice! You should be a producer or something.
Ha, ha.
Yeah, right! [doorbell neighs.]
But not yet.
Keep manning the door.
[sighs.]
Yeah.
Ah! All dry! Sorry, I got a little distracted on the way back by some people with a Ouija board.
A dead soul told me to "AERXIXFASP"! What could it mean? Cool.
While you were gone, Ben Stein introduced me to Tim Allen, and the three of us had a long debate about government spending, which is exactly how I wanted to spend my Halloween.
I am so sorry.
Although, I have to say, now that your TV show has put us into a new tax bracket, maybe we should start paying attention more to how the government is using our money.
What? No, I don't know, ya know, I'm just saying that a true capitalist-free market is actually, if you really think about it, more fair than an arbitrary redistribution based on need.
This is from Ten Minutes with Tim Allen? You left me alone for an hour and a half! I guess time flies when you're having fun? I am not having fun! [all gasping.]
[grunts.]
Hey, I need a costume.
I can't be costume-less at my own party.
Mm.
Hmm.
Follow me.
[gasps.]
Hold that.
Now circle around here.
Oh.
What Okay.
Just need some tape.
No.
What are Hey.
No, I get that there's a smoke monster, but other than that, it's just Gilligan's Island, right? [groaning.]
[Peanutbutter gasps.]
Oh, thank you so much.
No! [woman gasps.]
[panting.]
Whoa! [glass shatters.]
[grunts.]
[groans.]
Jessica! Am I written by Albert Hammond and Diane Warren, originally recorded by Tina Turner, but popularized by Ace of Base? Because "Don't Turn Around.
" [slo-mo.]
Huh? [groaning.]
[screaming.]
Mummy! [gong sound.]
What do you mean, a duel? You mean like, like a duel, a duel? [clears throat.]
Hold on, somebody's Baby Bjorn Borg.
Oh, my God.
Yes! Cute.
What do you want? Oh, um, I actually wanted to introduce yourself.
I mean myself.
[chuckles.]
Obviously, you already know yourself, so [laughing.]
Oh, God.
Listen, I just wanted to tell you how much I loved Horsin' Around.
It was, like, a very formative part of my childhood.
So thank you.
I get a warm feeling every time I think about the song.
Three little orphans, one, two, three I'm sorry.
I'm on the phone right now.
Oh.
Uh Sorry.
Yeah, Mom, I'm still here.
No, it was nobody important.
No, I get them to Glee Club.
But why are they singing when they're not in the Glee Club? Where's the music coming from? Doesn't seem realistic.
Why did you make me talk to BoJack? I made a complete fool of myself.
No.
I can't do this.
I'm good in small groups.
I'm great in chat-rooms and message boards.
[shouts.]
But I hate big parties! [record scratches.]
What? No! Yes! And I didn't wanna tell you because I know how much this party means to you.
[shouts.]
But I can't be more fun than your ex-wives! It's too much pressure! I'm sorry.
[panting.]
[door slams.]
Uh-huh.
[music playing over stereo.]
Whoo! Uh-huh.
Hey, Pickles? I'm sorry.
For what? I shouldn't talk about my ex-wives so much.
I don't want you to feel like you have to be fun.
But I am fun.
It has nothing to do with you, or your ex-wives, or your ex-wife Diane, who is in this room right now.
Okay, now I'm looking for the owner of a blue Tesla, a red Maserati, and a gold helicopter.
Let's just get out of here.
[crying.]
I don't wanna get out of here! I'm having fun! This is fun for me! [record scratches.]
[sobbing.]
What's up with the waitress? You left me alone all night long! I ask so little of you! And you never listen.
I know, but now I am listening, and I swear I will stay by your side, now and forever.
I'll be on you like Urkel on Laura.
"Will I do that?" Yes, I will.
You know what? No.
Because now I want to be alone.
So, have fun hanging out with all your hippie liberal friends, okay? 'Cause I'm going home.
Kar-nina! Don't go! Ugh.
Party's over.
All right, fine.
Let's make this an annual thing, though, okay? I wanna see all of you, back here, next year! No matter what! I asked you to do one thing, keep me away from mummies.
And you couldn't even do that! Okay, in my defense, I am dressed like a giant notebook, which severely limits my mobility! How do you think I felt when I had to do that screen test all wrapped up in gauze? Wait.
You were auditioning to play the mummy? Mom, I gotta go.
Okay? I'll call you tomorrow.
Yeah.
We will figure out Dad's funeral.
And I'm I'm sorry.
[phone beeps.]
You! Boy! What's going on? I think the party's over, sir.
[sighs.]
I always thought that when this happened, I would feel something.
I don't know what, but something.
But I don't feel anything.
What's wrong with me? Nothing's wrong.
Just sometimes parties are over.
[sighs.]
But Hey, it doesn't have to be over.
I mean, I could stick around for a little bit.
Yeah, sure, good idea.
Stick around for as long as you want.
Yeah? Okay.
I'm sorry I ruined another Halloween for you.
You didn't ruin it.
I really wanted you to think I was fun.
Diane, you don't need to pretend to be something you're not.
I already love you.
What? And I'm going to love you, no matter what version of you you are.
So, you might as well give me the real version.
This is good.
Now I know you don't like parties.
So, we will never have that argument again.
Yeah.
I really humiliated myself in front of BoJack.
[engine.]
If it makes you feel better, I guarantee BoJack won't even remember that he met you.
Huh.
Okay, new strategy.
I'm looking for four strong construction workers who can lift my car and carry it out to the street, like in the Mentos commercial.
Any takers? [Peanutbutter.]
Open the door! [Pickles.]
Just leave me alone! What's going on in there? Tough SAT prep course? Fail her learner's permit test? Skirmish with the members of the Baby-Sitter's Club? Nope.
Shattered dreams of playing Adelaide in her high school's production of Guys and Dolls because the musical director sees her as more of a Rusty Charlie? I don't know why this keeps happening.
I take these amazing women, like Pickles, like you, Katrina, Jessica, and I ruin them.
Uh I'm not ruined.
No, I just mean I don't listen.
Okay, yes.
It is definitely very annoying how you don't listen.
Thank you, but you don't have to say nice things just to make me feel better.
Huh? Okay, no.
I was going to say you not listening and I repeat, you don't listen, that's not the only thing going on here.
There are more things? What do all these women have in common? They're mean? When you first start dating them.
They're fun? They're young.
You keep dating women in their 20s.
I do, do that.
They're not fully-formed yet.
Life changes people.
Well, not me.
That's kind of my point.
You don't ruin these women, they just grow up.
So, what you're saying is they all grow up, but I stay the same age? All right.
All right.
All right.
How do I fix that? Well, either you date someone older Ooooooor Or, you grow up.
Because otherwise, they're gonna keep outgrowing you.
Mind if I try? Okay, first thing we need to do is sit you up and get you hydrated.
Thanks.
I understand what you're going through.
I've been in your position before, and this party is hard.
[hiccups.]
It is! It's hard to be the new girlfriend.
And to be at a famous person's house, at an event with 25 years of history, and all these people Mr.
Peanutbutter has known for years.
[hiccups.]
Plus, you're here.
Plus, I'm here.
What if I'm just a rebound? Mm.
I was a rebound.
And he loved me, so much, for ten years.
If there's one thing I know about him, it's that he loves the person he's with deeply and unconditionally.
So, you don't have to worry about me, because I'm not that person anymore.
You are.
Aw.
[chuckles.]
[door opens.]
Oh! [Pickles sighs.]
If you guys will excuse me, I'm just gonna take this dickhole's helicopter home.
Are you okay? Yeah.
I'm actually really glad you went through all those ex-wives because it means I got the best version of you.
That's right.
Version 4.
0.
Oh! I like the sound of that.
Hey, you wanna just go home? Hang out, just the two of us? Psh! No way! I just saw on Tweed Feed that Josephine's ex, Tor, is throwing a monster shindig up in NoHo.
Who-sephine's ex-what now? They have a two-story ice luge, and a huge beer pond tournament.
And I brought new costumes, so we don't have to look stupid wearing the same in all our pictures.
[laughs.]
I never wanna grow up! [chuckles.]
[sighs.]
Where's everybody going? It's Halloween! [groaning.]
[door opens.]
Happy Hallowee What the? Where is everyone? Hey, let's do this again next year.
I'm going to bed.
I love Halloween.
[BoJack's voice.]
I don't know what's real anymore.
And I don't know if I care.
[buzzing.]
[sighs.]
Talk to me, Philbert.
Don't tell her a thing.
[car horn.]
What did you do to your wife? [sighs.]
She was gonna get us all killed.
So you took care of it, huh? I tried to stop him! Who? Fritz! He was hopped up on goof-berries.
[pills rattling.]
Agh! I think I shot him.
[Peanutbutter.]
Agh! What are you doing, Philbert? Oh-hh! You shot your partner? [groans.]
Ugh! [moans.]
Cut! We're turning around for BoJack.
[bell ringing.]
All right! That was acting.
Hey, so, this has been real, but since it's our last day, it feels like maybe we should call it on the whole us sleeping together thing.
I don't usually keep dating co-stars once we've wrapped.
Would you say we're co-stars? I mean, I'm Philbert.
I'd say we're more like both in the cast? Yeah, let's definitely pump the brakes on this.
And we're set.
Action! I had no choice.
He was strangling my wife! What did you do with the bodies? I It's all a blur.
It feels like a dream.
Where are the bodies, Philbert? I buried them.
In the same place I'm gonna bury you.
[gasps.]
Right here.
Oh! Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.
There's no time for that now.
The nuclear missiles are coming.
Cut! That's a wrap on Philbert Season One! Great work, everyone! I want you all to know I'm proud of what I've done here.
See ya at the Peabody Awards! Great working with you.
Thank you.
[Princess Carolyn.]
Terrific job.
Seriously What the hell are goof-berries? [theme music playing.]
Oh! [chuckles.]
I love the sign.
You better.
I basically had to go through a whole pen on that thing.
Uh Hey, I'd help you with your bag, but you know, my back.
Yeah.
It's cool that you came through Los Angeles on your way home.
Yeah, I guess we got lucky.
The only flight from Connecticut to Kansas had a one-night layover in California.
Really? No, dummy.
I wanted to see you.
[grunts.]
[chuckles.]
[music playing.]
[group cheering.]
[woman on intercom.]
Emily is here to see you.
Blunt? Well, she is a little curt.
That's my Emily! Send her in! Hey, Todd.
[sighs.]
You okay? I broke up with my fireman.
Not Steve! No, no, no, not Steve.
It was Doug.
Not Doug! Forgot there was a new one! I am so done with these sexy noble hero hunks.
The sex is great, but the emotional connection just is not there.
It was the same with me and Yolanda.
No emotional connection, but the no-sex was amazing.
None of the best sex I ever had.
You know, I was actually thinking about that.
Remember that idea you had about the dating app for asexuals? Nope! [phone clicking.]
Yeah, here we go.
Ta-da-da-da! [Todd.]
"All About That Ace"? You should get yourself out there.
You were the best boyfriend I ever had.
If only there was a version of you I could have sex with, I'd be all set.
Whoa, Emily.
I just got a crazy idea.
What? A restaurant where the menus are printed on garlic bread, so after you order, the first course is the menu! Oh.
[clock ticking.]
So, ever since Philbert wrapped earlier today, the question on everybody's mind is, "What's Mr.
Peanutbutter going to do next?" You're a serious actor now, so I guess, narrate a documentary about global warming, and then take a private jet to the premiere? I've been looking for new projects.
Seems like everything's based on books these days, so I went to the book store to scout some material.
Mm-hmm.
But all the books are so long now.
Yeah? Who has the time? I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out, then see the movie, and decide if the book the movie is based on would make a good movie.
Oh, that's a good strategy.
Anyway, I was heading to the door in book-length-related frustration [groans.]
when I saw one of those circular greeting card racks.
Spotted a card that looked interesting, and it's a super-quick read.
[flutters.]
Eh? "Happy Birthday, Dad.
" Pretty cool dad, huh? You want to option this greeting card for a movie? We'll call it Birthday Dad.
But what is it? Hmm? Mmm it's "Birthday Dad.
" Oh.
Okay.
You think we can get the film rights? I'll look into it.
[moans.]
[giggles.]
So, then Joby was like, "Uh, nice scrunchie, Professor.
" It was literally a thing.
Joby is the guy in your dorm who plays guitar? Yeah, he's really funny, but like soulful funny, you know? That's great.
Oh! [BoJack.]
You know, I always thought I would make a good college person.
Roaming the campus, sticking it to the crusty old dean with my rowdy 'tude, having friends, and learning things, and just, uh, being young.
[sighs.]
You okay? You look as if you saw Ghost in the Shell and you're Scarlett Johansson's publicist.
It's weird to be back in this house.
This is where it all happened with your mom.
Oh, my God, this is so weird.
Hollyhock, whoa.
It's okay.
That's ancient history.
My mom is dead, so nobody is going to drug you with secret pills.
All right? Now, how about we make new, fun, memories to cancel out the old ones? Can the new memories be pizza-related? No doy! Ah, thank you for meeting me on such short notice.
It's nice to see you.
I'm sure Fridays must be a big night for you.
You were probably planning on going out to a nice dinner with your new girlfriend? Or seeing a movie with your new girlfriend? Or staying in and watching cable I get what you're asking.
The answer is, no, I don't have cable anymore.
Oh! [chuckles.]
Or a new girlfriend.
I'm not seeing anyone either.
I've just been so busy with my Philbert.
Philbert? You have a Philbert? Oh, I'm sorry.
It's a show I'm producing.
Not the baby we really wanted but never had.
Oh, well, that's great, too.
Anyway, Mr.
Peanutbutter wants to option this card as a movie.
Birthday Dad.
How is it a movie? Hmm.
It's "Birthday Dad.
" Oh.
Okay.
[ringtone playing.]
Oh! I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Sure.
[phone beeps.]
Hello? [Tracy.]
Can you get to the St.
Bernard Medical Center in like, a half hour? Uh, I think so.
Why? I just got my tonsils taken out, and I need a ride home.
What? Nah, I'm just messing with you.
A pregnant lady doesn't want the baby.
If you can get there tonight, the baby's yours.
Tonight? That's so She doesn't even know me.
Hey, man.
You don't say no to free baby.
[sighs.]
Okay.
Is everything okay? I have to drive my hospital to the car right now! I'm a baby, and there's adopting on the way! You're adopting? Vroom-vroom! There's so much food in my lap! Doesn't matter! It's fine! All part of being a mother! You are really freaking out.
Am I freaking out too much? Or not enough? Let me drive you.
But I have the car seat in my car.
They won't let you go home without one.
It's the only rule, really.
There should be more rules, but who am I to judge? [breathing heavily.]
Hey, breathe.
I'll get the car seat.
Let's go.
Ugh.
I ate too much.
I need ice cream to smoosh the rest of it down.
Oh, I don't keep junk food in the house, ever since last night when I ate all of my ice cream.
Hey, why do you have a vodka bottle for every day of the week? Oh, that's just my new system I'm trying.
I'm down to one bottle a day.
Is this like an AA thing? No, I don't need AA.
Would you get outta there? I want ice cream.
Give me your keys.
What? No.
Come on.
Let me drive the Tesla.
With your greasy pizza fingers? Forget it.
Come on! [giggling.]
Hey.
Ooh! What the hell are these? What? Oh, those Why was this in your pocket? Are these for me? No, Hollyhock.
God, no.
Oh God, did you put this in my pizza? What? Of course not.
Hollyhock.
No.
Give me the no! Oops.
Hollyhock, those were for my back! Wait, for real? Yes.
Oh, then actually, oops.
[lock clicks.]
Hey, Todd.
Is everything okay? I need to talk to someone, and you're the only person I knew would be available on a Friday night, with nothing to do.
Hey, I almost went to the movies tonight! It's not my fault there's never anything in the 8:00 hour.
9:15 is too late.
7:00 is too early.
When am I supposed to eat dinner? Uh, sneak in a bag of mashed potatoes like the rest of us? Is this your whole apartment? It's a studio.
I ate lunch with a studio head just yesterday.
This is not a studio.
What do you need, Todd? Well, my friend, Emily, did something really nice for me, and I wanna pay her back.
Thought you could help me brainstorm.
Okay.
What kind of things does she like? Well, sex, for one.
Good for her! A woman needs to know her own body before she expects someone else to know her body.
What? What are we talking about? What? I think sex, for one? Oh! Diane, you sad-homed genius.
You've cracked it! What? To the junkyard behind the engineering school! Always happy to contribute! [crashes.]
[rattling.]
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I freaked out.
It's not your fault.
Your generation's been brainwashed by McGruff the Crime Dog.
Who, by the way, I met at a party once? Didn't ask me a single question about me.
Yeah, and also because of the time I overdosed on pills.
Right, well, these were good pills.
I told you I'm on a system now.
I'm not "doing drugs.
" This was medicine.
Can you get more? Oh, sure.
I'll just call the pharmacy and say, "Hey, girl, you know that highly-addictive opioid I'm supposed to take every three hours? Well, I kind of misplaced them, so could I just get some more? I'm totally not a drug addict.
" I'm really sorry.
No.
It's fine.
Let's enjoy our time together, even though I'm in tremendous pain.
I'll try to forget it, but the whole time we might be thinking about it.
I do not blame you, but if you blame yourself, that is okay with me.
You must know a place you can get more painkillers.
I do know a guy, but he's somewhat "south of Pico," if you know what I mean.
I don't.
Why do Los Angeles people think everyone else understands your local references? Okay, okay, let's go.
I can't believe you're adopting.
I just realized it was the right thing for me.
I just remember you were so adamant about having the baby yourself, even when I said we should talk about other options.
Yeah, but the way you said it I'm not mad.
I just think it's funny you had that change of heart after we broke up.
[sighs.]
[sighs.]
I'm sorry.
This is not about me.
You'll be a great mom, and I'm really happy for you.
Yeah? Of course.
Well, one day, you're gonna be a great dad.
Hopefully as cool as Birthday Dad! [chuckles.]
Why are we at the pediatrician? Trust me.
This doctor is the sleaziest, dopiest, scurviest of the scurvy.
Who is he? Exactly.
[Hollyhock yelps.]
Hu wants to par-tay? Dr.
Hu! Thank you for squeezing us in! You always gotta make time for your friends.
And I haven't seen you since Sarah Lynn's funeral.
Oh, right.
That was a huge wake-up call for me.
Next morning I looked in the mirror, and you know who I saw staring back at me? [Hollyhock.]
Who? Exactly.
What? No.
Hu.
I spent 30 days at Pastiches Malibu and now I'm sober.
It's like I completely regenerated as a brand-new doctor.
Congratulations.
You'd have to be a real lost cause not to seek help after losing Sarah Lynn like that, don't you think? Oh, deffo.
I mean, you know, get help or, you know, work out a system on your own.
Even, you know, whatever's right for you.
Anyway, I'm trying to get my hands on some Feelbetterin? Feelbetterin? BoJack, have you been taking oxypraxylcortizoid? Yeah.
I know what you're thinking, but I legitimately have a herniated disc.
He's telling the truth! I threw out his pills because of my trauma from when I got drugged by his mama.
You got drugged by your own mother? No, my mother.
Her mother was a maid who got knocked up by my dad, but she got adopted by eight other dads.
Okay, do you know how many times I hear this story every week? This story, specifically? Even the "eight dads" part? I don't know who you think you're fooling, but this Hu won't get fooled again.
Thank you for coming, Emily.
What's with all the candles? Why are you wearing a robe? Oh, I blew a fuse earlier, so I had to light candles.
That took a while, and then I didn't get to change.
Oh.
Hold that thought.
The thought of "Oh"? That's right.
Because you're gonna need it when you meet your new best friend Uh [grunts.]
Whoa! Henry Fondle! [robot screaching.]
What? What? He's a sex robot! So, you can stop dating all those boring guys and still have sex! Stop me if you've heard this one.
What? And guess what? I even recorded dozens of sexy robot phrases for it to say at random intervals! [clicks.]
[robot.]
I am Henry Fondle.
Insert me into genitals! Why did you do this? To show you that I care about your needs.
[robot.]
My prime directive is to pleasure you.
Todd, I'm not sure you understand how sex works.
That is so condescending.
I know what sex is.
I am not a child.
I'm just not great at building robots.
This is my first one, and frankly, I think it's pretty impressive I put it together in one afternoon.
I love it when you call me "Father.
" [clatters.]
[both gasp.]
Oh, no! My wacky scheme backfired as always! I'm really sorry.
It's fine.
We're spending time together, that's all that matters.
You're not super-mad at me, still? When this is done, maybe it'll make a great story you can tell that kid you have a crush on.
Who, Joby? [chuckles.]
I don't have a crush on him.
Get out of here.
His jawline is, like, dumb.
Oh, okay.
Where are we going now? There's this actress I was kind of seeing while we were working together and I might have left some pills at her place.
She made it clear she doesn't want to see me again but she's not home now.
Why do I know Gina's schedule? Where is she? She has a book club with dumb Nicole who keeps picking very long Italian books that Nicole doesn't even read.
Why do I know about Gina's friends? Do you have a key? I have my ways.
Well, I'm out of ways.
I'll go around back and see if there's a window I can climb through.
Ooh, good thinking! I'll stand guard.
[winces.]
Ugh.
Oh, shit.
BoJack? Oh, my God! What happened to book club? We switched it to Thursdays to confuse Nicole.
Why are you here? I just wanted to check on you.
[Gina sighs.]
[gasps.]
[gasps.]
Wait, Gina.
No, stay outside.
I just I need to talk to you.
Slowly.
Is this about our relationship? What is there to talk about? Well, I just been thinking that we should keep looking at this relationship.
Like all parts of this relationship.
Like even in the junk drawer, in the kitchen of this relationship.
Or the bathroom cabinet.
I told you I didn't want to see you.
I want you to know that you are top-shelf, Gina.
Know what I mean? Top shelf.
So, what, you wanna get back together? Eh? Yes! Wait, really? Okay, I gotta run.
BoJack.
I have had 28 on-set flings, and no guy has ever come to my house after shooting was over to try to have a real relationship.
Well I guess I sort of internalized the idea I didn't deserve that? Yeah, but like I said, I really gotta run.
But maybe I do deserve it.
Maybe we both do.
BoJack, is it possible that we're the ones we've been waiting for? Uh, yes.
I totally think that is possible, which is why I can't wait to talk about this tomorrow! What? Where are you going? I'll call you! [Hollyhock panting.]
Whoa! Think I need to call her, or did I leave things open enough where I can kinda ghost? What? Kidding! I'll call her.
I'm very fond of that woman.
And I'm sure that things are gonna work out fine, and we can find a way to be happy together and I won't hurt her in a way that she carries with her for the rest of her life.
Uh, okay.
Lemme get them pills.
What the hell? These aren't my pills! Sorry! Not your fault.
It's just my back.
I got another idea.
Okay.
Do you think Gina needed those? She'll be fine.
Nobody needs pills.
You could've just dropped me off.
I wanted to be here.
Hope that's okay.
It's actually nice you're here.
All the times I imagined us taking home a baby from the hospital, I never pictured it like this.
You mean, you never pictured it would happen on a Friday? [laughs.]
Yeah, exactly.
That's the main difference.
[sighs.]
How come you never called me after I kicked you out of my apartment? You were so mad at me.
I didn't think you wanted me to.
I didn't.
But you still should have called.
Well, you could have called me.
Yeah.
I wish you'd stayed with me that night.
You told me to leave.
Yeah.
I guess the lesson is, don't listen to me, right? [Ralph chuckles.]
Mm-hmm.
Is that really what you're gonna wear for the first time your new baby sees you? Yes? Oof! Okay.
I'm supposed to be back at the airport in, like, two hours.
Is this really how you want to spend this time? Again, and [chuckles.]
I hate to keep harping on this, we wouldn't be here if someone hadn't dumped my medicine.
I know, but this place is super sketchy.
It looks like where they did the drag race in Grease.
It is where they did the drag race in Grease.
Where do you think they make movies? Ooh! [Hollyhock yelps.]
[tires screech.]
You a cop? What? No.
Oh, shit.
No, it's a costume.
I just finished filming a show.
Normally, people return the costume.
Hello, drug merchant.
Is it lit under here? What? Are there illegal pharmaceuticals available for purchase? And please, talk into my lollipop.
Okay, this guy's a cop.
I assure you I am not.
He's just saying that because earlier I said he was a cop.
No.
You can see the outline of his badge under his tee-shirt! Yeah, no, he's definitely a cop.
Seems cool to me.
Listen.
If I were a cop, I'd have pancake breath from the precinct's weekly Friday night pancake dinners.
But I do not.
So clearly, not a cop.
Uh Unless, I somehow had an Altoid, or a Tic-Tac after, which again, no.
[chuckles.]
I am a gum guy.
That all tracks for me.
Here are your drugs.
Aha! We got the package! Whoa! [tires screech, siren wails.]
[BoJack.]
Run! [Hollyhock gasps.]
They're getting away! Go, go, go! [siren wails.]
[BoJack panting.]
[Hollyhock moans.]
[Hollyhock.]
Oh, no! Here, get up.
[both grunting.]
[grunts.]
Eh? Come on! We have to keep moving! [groans.]
[hissing.]
[Emily.]
Ooh! Thanks, Doug.
I'm not here for you.
I'm here because I respect the art of putting out fires.
[puffs.]
I'm really sorry, Emily.
It was a sweet idea.
I guess I just thought you waste so much time with these boring firemen just for the sex.
Eh? Doug, some privacy, please? Okay.
Maybe I figured if you had some other way to satisfy yourself sexually, then you could spend more time with me.
Like we did in high school.
Todd, we were dating in high school.
Do you ever think about what it would be like if we dated now? I don't know.
What would it be like? I guess we'd hang out together, like we already do.
And you would be my favorite person, like you already are.
And when something good happened to me, like if I got a promotion at work, you'd be the first person I'd tell, and you'd smile and say, "That's my boyfriend.
" Well, that could be cool.
But then I would have sex with the robot? [whirring.]
Boop, boop, boop! Oh! [splatters.]
[sighs.]
Uh-hh! Hooray.
I guess it's not ideal.
You know, when I was putting the app together, I learned that some asexuals actually do have sex.
Do you think that there's a chance? [mutters.]
Um-umm.
Okay.
Well, you got any other ideas? Hmm.
What about if marbles were cube-shaped, so they don't roll away as much? No dice.
[sighs.]
[Princess Carolyn.]
Oh, he's beautiful.
Do you think I'm terrible for giving him away? What? Of course not.
I don't know the first thing about being a parent.
Bridget, it's okay.
Your baby's in excellent hands.
I'm just so glad he's going to a good home, with a mother and a father.
What's this, now? I mean, if my boyfriend was still in the picture, maybe I could be a parent, but as is, I think the baby's probably better off with you two.
Oh, no, Ralph's not That's right! We're gonna make a wonderful family together.
Ralph, don't lie to her.
I'm not lying.
A year ago, we wanted to have a family together.
I still want that.
Ralph, no.
You should go.
I hear you say that, but I'm not making the mistake I made last time.
I don't want this.
This seems like a subject you should have agreed on before you came to the hospital.
We can do this.
Nothing has changed.
I changed! I have plans now, and you're not in them.
You don't need to do this by yourself.
I never needed to.
I want to.
I'm not afraid of how hard it's gonna be.
I already love this baby.
And that gives me so much power.
I don't need anything else.
Oh, my God, I just realized something.
If you can do it by yourself, maybe that means I can do it by myself.
Uh No, no, Bridget, you definitely can't.
I thought I couldn't.
But that speech you gave was so inspiring.
It made me realize that all I need to be a good mother is love.
Actually, you need so much more than that.
I was wrong when I said that a second ago.
[chuckles.]
Okay.
But for real, give me my baby boy.
[moans.]
Oh-hh Coochie-coochie-choo [moans.]
Princess Carolyn, you are amazing.
Can you be my mom? [groans.]
Oh-hh! [both panting.]
[coughing.]
There's gotta be another way to get pills.
How about calling this Joby? He sounds like a druggie.
I thought your back hurts.
Yeah.
How did you lift me over the fence? Well, the adrenaline kicked in.
Do you really need these pills? Hollyhock, how many times I'm just saying, is it possible maybe you don't Okay.
You go to college and suddenly you're so sophisticated, and I'm a dumb junkie, is that it? What? No! You don't understand anything! I am in pain.
No, I get that.
All the time.
my whole life.
And you have no idea.
So, sorry that you had one bad experience with my mom, but I have been in pain my whole life.
[sighs.]
I think you should take me to the airport.
Okay.
You're sure I can't drive you home? No, Ralph.
Can I at least wait with you for the cab? [sighs.]
Okay.
[buckle clicks.]
So, I guess I'll see you later.
Hollyhock, I'm sorry.
Me, too.
Maybe, it's possible that I don't 100-percent need-need the pills.
I thought I did, but yeah.
So, thank you for caring about me.
Are you gonna be okay? Yeah.
I could take a semester off, if you need someone No.
God, no.
Stay stay in school.
And take your classes, and kiss boys, and do the college thing.
I'm gonna be fine.
I get it.
Drugs are bad.
Not all drugs.
Obviously, if you get hurt again, and a doctor, a real doctor prescribes you painkillers, you can take them.
But only if you get hurt again.
Okay.
You promise? Yes.
I promise.
Okay.
I love you.
[sighs.]
Hmm.
Okay.
Bye.
[whirring.]
[clicks, beeping.]
[sighs.]
[sighs.]
Whew.
[traffic noises.]
[hatch clicks.]
Ugh! [panting.]
Uh [groaning.]
[groaning.]
[tires screech.]
[crashing.]
[bell rings.]
[panting.]
[door creaks.]
[sighs.]
What troubles you, Sister? It's the woman who came from the water.
She's been in our care for two years.
She hasn't spoken a word and spends her days in a fog.
Have you been steadfast in your prayers? I have.
And yet, her condition does not improve.
"And yet"? Is prayer but a bargain? Is it for you to present terms to the Lord? No, Mother.
I just You seek a sign from God.
Should He seek less from you? [sighs.]
Take the woman to the seaside tomorrow after Matins.
Prove your faith to Him that He might reveal His glory to you.
Yes, Mother.
Can you feel that on your feet? That's water.
Water.
This is hopeless! I want to help you, but I don't even know who you are! I look at your face and think you could be literally anyone.
Are you a federal judge? A Russian spy? A proud Southern matriarch? [gasps.]
Bo BoJack! What? BoJack! What are you saying? I don't BoJack! BoJack! BoJack! [gasps.]
[theme music playing.]
[grunting.]
Agh, oh! [sirens wailing.]
Gah! Bleh! Agh! [moans.]
Ow! Come on, get up.
We're gonna be late.
How have I gained weight? Spent two weeks in a hospital hooked up to a feeding tube.
You drank milkshakes.
That's not a feeding tube.
It's basically a feeding tube.
How many do you take a day? Are you in that much pain right now? I'm about to be.
Reviews are out.
Okay.
"Philbert is an astonishment, with Horseman bringing surprising depth to the eponymous character.
" "Surprising depth"? God, they always gotta slant it.
Why can't it just be "depth"? I'd hate to see you after a bad review.
Oh, and I bet "eponymous" was supposed to be a pun on "pony.
" Wait.
There's a part about me.
"Gina Cazador also appears as Sassy Malone.
" Wow, I've never been mentioned in a review before.
"Her restrained performance crackles with nuance and power.
" Damn, look at me in two sentences.
Well, don't let it go to your head.
Probably just because you're a good actor.
Anyway, I got you something for the premiere party.
These are beautiful, BoJack.
Well, don't let it go to your head.
It's because you visited me in the hospital every day, and I got used to having you around, and it turns out I like you.
Uh-oh.
I let them go to my head.
[elevator dings.]
"What separates Philbert is the character's vulnerability.
This is not the sad man as suave and cynical anti-hero, but a barely scabbed-over wound of a person.
" "Barely scabbed-over.
" Congratulations.
You're the one who took a stock bad-boy detective and made him into a wound.
Me? No.
You're coming to the premiere party? Already on my way.
My apartment is a two-hour drive from everywhere.
Seven miles, two hours.
How is that possible? Honk, honk! Well, that'll give you plenty of time to come up with a few spontaneous remarks for the red carpet.
[Diane.]
Oh, do I have to do that? Look, I gotta go.
You'll be great.
Just be charmingly effusive.
Be yourself.
I can't be both of those things at once! Can I help you? Abel Ziegler.
I saw the trailer for your new show Philbert, and I think you oughta see this.
[slurps.]
"What did the clam say to the crab at the undersea ball?" I think you know why I'm here.
Oh, fish.
Well, buddy, these past few months, you have been inappropriate with every person who's come to our apartment.
[Henry.]
I want to be inside you.
[sighs.]
Henry Fondle, you are inside of me.
You always have been.
But there's nowhere else I can take you.
[Henry.]
Let's get down to business.
You want me to take you to work? No way! Oh, yes! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! [banging.]
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! [sighs.]
I need you to be on your best behavior today.
That is the stuff I like.
I also like clearly defined expectations.
It seems we understand each other.
Bow-chicka wow-wow Chicka-wow-wow [crashes.]
Mmm-ch, mmm-ch! So, tonight, are we, like, together-together at this thing? Oh, uh, well I mean, I know we're together.
I just meant publicly.
Like, are we gonna introduce the world to "BoJina"? Well, yeah, I just I'm not sure the world is ready for, um, BoJina.
Oh, yeah, you're probably right.
[phone chimes.]
[sighs.]
What do you want, Mr.
Peanutbutter? Gotcha! It's not Steven Spielberg.
I changed my name in your contacts.
[BoJack groans.]
Pickles wants to say "hi.
" What pickles? Hi, BoJack! Uh, hello.
Are you the pickles? I don't know if I'm the Pickles, but maybe one day.
Right now I'm just a waitress.
Oh, right.
The waitress.
Well, I don't know if I'm the waitress.
She's being modest.
She's a waitress-slashaspiring Instagram influencer.
What? Is that Gina? Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Wow.
BoJack Horseman and Mr.
Peanutbutter, and also Gina on the same phone call? What is this? I don't know what this is.
Why did you call me? [Peanutbutter.]
Oh, yeah! You wanna ride with me and Pickles to the premiere? It'll be like this, but for 40 minutes.
Hard no.
Hardly no? That sounds like a yes.
Okay, bye.
[phone beeps.]
Well, anyway hello? Huh.
He must have accidentally hung up, right after he accidentally said, "Okay, bye.
" As the clam said to the crab at the undersea ball "Shell we dance?" There are some superficial similarities.
Superficial, shmuperficial! It's the same line! Doesn't mean I stole it! Flip.
I spent months on that line.
I slaved, finessed, crafted.
The world was a block of marble, and, like Michelangelo, I chiseled it into my David, as I did for each and every one of Crazy AZ's Frozen Funnies.
Mr.
Ziegler, we have so much respect for your work.
Do you think I'm like a penny on a railroad track? Prone to flattery? We've got a premiere to get to.
How long do we have to listen to this guy do his Popsicle schtick? It's pronounced "stick," idiot.
Play nice, Flip.
If this gets out, everyone will be talking about the stolen gag, instead of all the great parts of the show that weren't stolen.
Fine.
What do you want? I want what every comedy writer wants.
Respect! Oh! What if I just let you come to the premiere party with us? They have tiny tacos in soft shells that are impossible to fold without making a big mess.
I accept your terms.
Where do I sign? Can we go now? Wait.
"Abel Ziegler ampersand"? What are you ampersanding? My former writing partner, Ziggy Abler.
What? I can only give permission for the part I wrote.
I'm the set-up guy.
If you want the punch line, you gotta talk to Ziggy.
Can you ask him to sign the release? I can't even ask him the best time to go to the dentist.
He hasn't talked to me for 30 years.
Now, you mentioned a party? [Flip groans.]
[camera shutters clicking.]
[Pickles.]
Wow! A real Hollywoo premiere party.
Can we get our pictures taken, and drink specialty cocktails, and form life-long bonds with other fancy celebrities, and read in magazines, "Who wore it better?" And then people vote, and then 78 percent of readers say, "Pickles did!" [chuckles.]
[camera shutters clicking.]
[reporters clamoring.]
Hey, BoJack, can we get some of just you? Oh, uh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you in there.
FYI, you're gonna want pictures of her after you see what she does in Philbert.
Let me tell you something, that 39-year-old actress is going places.
Oh.
Hey.
What happened to your arm? Oh, just some asshole got T-boned by me.
Oh, my God.
When? Uh couple weeks ago? Or months? As Philbert says, "Time is like a woman; completely impossible to comprehend.
" I think we ended up cutting that line because the network was worried it would be offensive to people who didn't know what time it was.
[clattering.]
This you call a tip? I haven't seen a tip this measly since my bris.
You must be Ziggy Abler.
Oh, thank you so much for coming.
Darling, you're wasting your time.
I love to sign documents.
In fact, that's my signature move.
But if Abel signed it, I won't.
I guess you could say I'm willing, but not Abel! Oh! Now where are those tiny tacos? Oh! [bell chimes.]
Cuckoo.
[Henry.]
Chicka-chicka, oh, yeah.
Mmm-ch, mmm-ch! [clattering.]
Oh, is it five o'clock already? If you've poured me a drink, you must want something.
Out with it.
[Henry.]
I want to be on top of you.
There's no one on top of me.
I'm CEO of this company.
That's my favorite position.
Well, you can't have it.
It's mine.
Give it to me.
You want to be tantamount to this catamount? You've got balls, I'll give you that.
[clanking, whirring.]
I am a horny robot.
For my job, yes, you've been quite clear.
But if you were CEO, what would I do? Take a portraiture class at the Learning Annex? While away the hours, painting canvas after canvas of my wife, and, through this act, rediscover the woman I fell in love with those many years ago? No, such a realization would only crush my too-feeble heart.
After all, what benefit is it to love without the words to express it? What could I possibly say to articulate my deep devotion to this woman, who has become but a stranger to me now? [whirring.]
I am powerless in the face of your mesmerizing sexual energy.
[gasps.]
Such a brain for business, yet such a tongue for poetry.
So, I am resigning from my post, effective immediately.
I leave you in the good hands of Henry Fondle.
[Henry, would you like to say a few words? Henry.]
You will submit to my desires.
Very impressive.
He's leaning in and I respect that.
Uh guys, are you sure about this? I've never been more sure about anything.
Todd, why don't you show your new boss around the premises? I'm actually about to head out to the Philbert premiere party.
[Henry.]
I'm coming.
Brilliant! You'll take him with you! Oh, no, no.
He doesn't need to come.
[Henry.]
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Oh, God, I'm coming.
Whatever you say boss.
[splattering.]
Hello, everyone.
Thank you for attending the premiere of my opus.
I hope you all enjoy it because that means you are smart.
If you don't get it, that means that my genius wasn't appreciated in my own time, and that's okay, too.
[weak laughter.]
Why are you laughing? Please do not laugh during the screening.
This episode contains no intentional humor.
[chuckles.]
Okay.
That's That's always a good sign, when you have to clarify that.
Look, folks, Herb is being modest.
"Herb"? I'm sorry.
[laughs.]
Flip.
Did I say Herb? Herb is being modest, but he put together a tremendous show that I think that you guys are really gonna love.
That's right.
It all came out of this brain.
Ha! That brain, he says? That brain? Double-ha! Shh! And the most amazing thing about this show is that I'm sure we all have Philberts in our lives, or we are Philberts.
You know, we've all done terrible things that we deeply regret.
I've done so many unforgivable things.
And I think that, that's what this show says.
Is that is that we're all terrible, so therefore we're all okay.
What? And I think that's a really powerful message.
Okay, well, without further ado, the first chapter, and notice I said "chapter" not episode because I think of this show as more of a novel than a TV show of Philbert! [applause.]
[BoJack's voice.]
Nothing's lonelier than a party.
[cheering, applause.]
Barf me a river! [camera shutter clicks.]
[phone clicking.]
Hey, Pickles, where have you been? You left after, like, ten minutes.
I'm sorry.
My friend Ilana, not my best friend Ilana, but another Ilana who is my friend, was having a crisis, and I needed to text her "LOL.
" Well, you missed the whole episode.
I saw the first ten minutes! I just couldn't get into it.
And you kept saying, "Do you love it? Are you loving it? How did you like that scene?" Well, did you love it? Were you loving it? How did you like that scene? Every time you showed up on screen, I kept thinking, "That's not a dirty cop, that's my boyfriend! The sweetest, cutest dog in the whole world!" And then you'd shoot someone, and I was like eww! Fritz is the hardest I've ever acted.
Oh.
Harder than the ice bucket challenge, but it was fake ice.
I wanted you to see it.
I'm going to fix this.
You stay here and party.
I'll go home.
I'll watch the entire season of your show.
You don't have to do that.
And you don't have to like every one of my Instagram posts, but you do.
The least I could do is watch your TV show, even if it kills me because I hate it so much.
Well, don't watch it if you hate it.
I'm going to do this for us.
But I love you! [sighs.]
[buzzing.]
I've been to dozens of these things and I've never heard applause like that.
We might actually get a season two.
That's never happened to me before.
That's incredible.
Excuse me, can I borrow you for a few minutes? Oh, sure.
Gina, do you mind if I, um? Yeah, go ahead.
Oh, no, I was actually talking to Gina.
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes? Oh! Well, yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came! Flip, I screwed up.
I didn't know it would feel like that.
To be in that room.
To hear people cheering for Philbert! What are you talking about? When I first started on this job, I wanted to make Philbert more well-rounded, so the audience could relate to him better.
And now you're upset because I didn't mention you in my introduction.
Diane, the whole point of television is it's a collaborative medium, where one person gets all the credit.
No, it's not about that.
I made him more vulnerable, and that made him more likable, which makes for a better TV show.
But if Philbert is just a way to help dumb assholesrationalize their own awful behavior, well, I'm sorry, but we can't put this out there.
Uh, it's out there.
The whole season's dropping at midnight all over the world.
I can't be here.
[Flip sighs.]
Come on, fellas.
I know we can find a solution here.
I doubt it.
We have the same problem as a hematology lab that goes a week without electricity! Too much bad blood! But you obviously work together so well.
What went wrong? It was a long time ago.
My wife Harriet always had a sneaker for Ziggy.
Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in? Unspoken? It was shouted! Nevertheless, me and Harriet ended up having a fling.
Eventually, we got married.
And that killed the partnership? No, we got over that.
But at their tenth anniversary, I had a few too many And what, you took a swing at him? I said I always felt he had the easier job, coming up with the punch lines.
And then what? What led to the rift? Led? That's the whole rift! He besmirched my craft.
I still haven't forgiven the son of a bitch! I said it then, and I stand by it now! All the pressure's on the punch line! Pressure? Please! Set-ups need context, mise-en-scÃ¨ne, flavor! I carried us to the top of the Popsicle stick game! You wrote the part they let you try before you buy! I had to deliver the money line! [both.]
Ugh! So, you both think you had the harder job? [Abel.]
Of course! Indubitably! Well, what if you tried switching roles? You mean, I tag his set-ups? Why not? I don't know.
I'm a punch line guy my whole life.
How do I come up with straight lines? You could try using a ruler.
Oh! [both laugh.]
Oh, I missed you, Abel! You, too, Zig! All right, so we have a deal? What did the terminally ill man say to Dr.
Kevorkian? "Give me that sweet release!" Hey.
Did you really mean what you said, before the screening? About how Philbert made you feel okay, about yourself? Oh, I don't know Because, you know, that's not the point of Philbert For guys to watch it and feel okay.
Diane, it's a compliment.
You did a good job.
Relax.
I don't want you, or anyone else, justifying their shitty behavior because of the show.
What is your problem? Why can't you accept that something you did is successful? It's connecting to people, and that's good.
You're right, sorry.
I don't know why I thought you would care.
Excuse me? What is going on with you? You're a mess.
Am I? I feel like I barely know you anymore.
Oh, bullshit.
Don't give me that.
It's true.
I don't know you.
No.
You know me.
You do.
Then what the hell happened in New Mexico? Look, I I don't know what you think that you know I don't know anything! I mean, I know something happened with a girl in New Mexico, and I know it resulted in you coming home in a boat.
Well, that's I also know that your old friend Charlotte lives in New Mexico because you used to leave her business card lying around the house, and I know her daughter is a senior at Oberlin.
How? And I know you went to Oberlin during your bender three years ago because a bunch of students posted pictures of you on Facebook.
Jesus Christ, why are you so obsessed with me? I am not obsessed.
I wanted to know what happened, and you wouldn't tell me.
You never asked! Okay, so I'm asking now.
What happened in New Mexico? Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland! [camera shutter clicks.]
What I don't understand is why you feel like you deserve to know every shitty thing I ever did.
I don't deserve anything.
I would like to know when you've done shitty things.
Why is that your business? Because I'm your friend, and I care about you, and I wrote a book about you, and now I wrote this show for you, and I am very publicly your friend, so if it gets out that you're doing creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.
Oh! So you're worried about things that I may have done because you think that it reflects badly on you? Hurts your brand? That's your moral high ground? This is not about "moral high ground.
" Wanna know about New Mexico? You want to know about the one little thing that I did in New Mexico, which, by the way, wasn't even really a thing? You know what? Spare me.
No, I'm gonna tell you.
I'll tell you what you want.
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about what happened at the MTV beach house? Or why I'm not allowed to fly United anymore? Or what happened with Sharona, the makeup lady on Horsing Around? What? Or the dozens of other shady things that may or may not have occurred in my life that I can barely even remember 'cause I was high or drunk or it was 30 years ago? And you don't feel bad, about any of this stuff? Yeah, of course I do! I've spent so much time feeling bad.
By the way, most of these women don't even remember, I bet.
Well, that's really convenient for you.
I'm the one who has to live with this shit.
I'm the one who has to feel the guilt all day, every day.
So, you're the victim here? Yeah, and I know that's not the woke, progressive, intersectionally appropriate thing to say, but I would say, yeah! I'm the one who has suffered the most because of the actions of BoJack Horseman.
You've suffered? Yeah, I have! The most? The most! Really? More than, say, Sarah Lynn? Don't talk to me about her.
No, I wanna know how you're the victim of the Sarah Lynn story.
I'm serious.
Explain to me how Sarah Lynn's overdose was really rough for you.
Shut up.
You feel a lot of guilt about that? You feel a lot of guilt because you were the only father figure she ever had, and when she came to you for help, you Hey, how you doing? You folks having a good time? You look great.
Thanks for coming.
You had sex with her? That's! No.
And then when she was sober, you took her on a month-long bender? And then she died.
And she is dead now.
And you're still alive.
With a girlfriend, who is also alive, and a TV show.
And that's been really hard for you, the main character in this story.
Why are you bringing this shit up? Is this fun for you? To really rub in It's not fun.
You win! You scored all the points in the argument! According to facts, you are right and I am wrong, like always.
But you know what? I don't care.
Because I'm trying to move forward.
You haven't changed at all.
Yes! Congratulations! You are the last person to get that.
I'm not gonna change.
I don't need your help for changing, so you can stop trying to make me your project.
That's not When I met you, I was depressed because I didn't like myself.
And when you wrote that book and sold a bajillion copies, you taught me that as screwed up as I am, that's okay.
You did that.
And now I'm okay.
I don't believe that's true.
And I don't think you believe it's true.
I think you want me to tell you that you can be better.
And even though you're being a total asshole right now, I still believe it.
If all you've gotten out of this friendship, is the idea that you should be okay with yourself, as you are, then I don't think this is a good relationship for either of us.
Diane, come on.
I'm going home.
No, Diane, we're saying things, but let's just go back to the party.
I'm done with all of this.
I went to New Mexico to see Charlotte.
She was married with a daughter.
But it wasn't like what you're thinking.
She was 17, which is the legal age of consent in New Mexico, and she wasn't drunk, so, not that I wanted to, I never I didn't.
That's the dumbest part of all of this! I didn't do anything.
I mean, the fact that this has turned into such a thing for you You know, maybe I didn't tell you because there was nothing to tell.
Did you ever think of that? She was my friend's daughter, and she wanted it, and I was [breathes.]
I was in a bad place because Charlotte had just So, then she came onto my boat, Charlotte, I mean, and she walked in, and I was with her daughter.
But again, nothing had happened yet.
"Yet?" Nothing happened.
Goodbye, BoJack.
Diane, no! Hey Aah! You wanted me to tell you.
I told you.
You know everything.
Please let go of me.
Diane, please.
You're hurting me, and I would like you to let go now.
[winces, sighs.]
[sighs.]
[spits, gulps.]
[gulps, sighs.]
[whirring.]
So, what'd you think of the show, boss? [Henry.]
More, more.
Well, all ten episodes will be on our website at midnight.
More.
You want more episodes? Give it to me.
Ooh! Flip! They're picking us up for more episodes! Wow.
And my mother said I'd never last as long as Hung.
Well, who's Hung now, Mom? Uh, right.
[puffs.]
Ugh.
[grunts.]
Ow! Oh, ah! [wires whizzes.]
[breaks lamp.]
Uh Oh.
Hey! Hey.
You're leaving? Yeah.
You? I'm just getting some air.
No, wrong Prius.
I'm sorry I lost my ticket! [sighs.]
[chuckles.]
Want me to drive you home? You can come back and get your car tomorrow? You don't have to do that.
Of course not.
I don't have to do anything.
[camera shutters clicking.]
[guests laughing.]
Gina, I know it's early, but have you started writing your acceptance speech for the Emmys? Oh, stop.
I'll probably just repurpose whatever I say at the SAG Awards.
[laughter.]
Is that gonna read as cocky? Can you explain to your readers that I'm being charmingly self-effacing? Excuse me.
Oh, hey, hot stuff! Whoa! [reporter gasps.]
[camera shutters clicking.]
[Gina moans.]
Thanks.
And, great job, by the way.
You're really good on the show.
Yeah? No.
Me? No.
Yeah? Yeah! You're a good actor.
I never knew that about you.
Well, I'll see you back on set, right? Did you hear we got picked up for more episodes? I'm not going back.
Oh.
Well, then, I guess I'll see you around.
I hope so.
[chuckles.]
I can't believe I finally got you to leave a party early.
Come on, you know I'd do anything for you.
Why? I'm such a disaster.
You're not a disaster.
You're Diane.
You're amazing.
Do you wanna come in? [end theme music playing.]
[BoJack.]
Previously on Philbert [sighs.]
Now I see why they call you "Sassy.
" Hello, old friend.
Fritz! But you're dead! Dead serious about haunting you.
[sighs.]
I haven't had sex that good since my wife died.
To be clear, the sex was pre-death.
Philbert, I don't want to be one of those girls, but did you murder your wife? How many people are dead because of you? Those were bad guys! They stole the mayor's submarine.
Tell me what happened.
I'm going to the chief! The whole world's gonna know what you did.
You can't do that, Marjorie.
John, it's over.
[gasps.]
Fritz, you maniac! What are you doing? What you're too chickenshit to do.
[gasping.]
John! Help! Oh-hh! [moaning.]
[gasping.]
[clicks.]
[Fritz grunts.]
You shot your partner? He was strangling my wife! Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.
There's no time for that now.
The nuclear missiles are coming.
[music playing.]
Well, I've been down To the girlie club With a hot glue gun full of beans Shot the beans on the railroad tracks [mumbling.]
Know what I mean I'm a man out of time And time keeps runnin' me down 'Cause rules are for fools And I ain't no clown, no They say the devil is a woman But I ain't no clown [music ends.]
[mask huffing.]
[Philbert narrating.]
It's been six months since the missiles hit.
The air is thick with the stench of death, and the hospitals are delivering some very wacky babies.
But, finally, they reopened the Yogurtland near me.
Sometimes, even mushroom clouds have a silver lining.
Hey, partner.
Looks like you're getting soft serve frozen yogurt.
[chuckles.]
Now I continue to see why they call you "Sassy.
" [narrating.]
It's also been six months since I told Sassy the truth.
About Fritz.
My wife.
And Sassy hasn't turned me in.
I think she likes me.
[Sassy sighs.]
[Flip.]
Cut! [bell rings.]
[spits.]
Ugh! BoJack, I told you not to eat the prop food.
That fake yogurt costs $500 a cup! Why? [BoJack.]
It's been two months since the first season of Philbert came out.
And it's a hit.
Which is great for me, but even better for Gina.
[camera shutters clicking.]
You know, I've done so many TV shows, but this is the first one that's kind of turned me into a star.
It's a big step up from just recurring on The Cops are Coming, Whee-oo, Whee-oo.
[BoJack.]
And the weird part is I'm not secretly bitter and jealous.
I like seeing her happy.
But I still have this little rancid itch saying something isn't right.
It's like there's always something lurking just beyond the horizon.
[ringing.]
Philbert the Troubled Detective.
I see.
Thank you.
Why do you still use a landline? [Philbert.]
What am I supposed to tell her, I'm just an old-fashioned guy? Or maybe I like things that are plugged to the wall? Something to grab onto if I start floating away.
That was my wife's landline.
[Fritz grunting.]
[gasps.]
I'm so sorry.
Never mind that.
The chief's been murdered.
Oh, Philbert, that's awful.
I know you didn't want him to be murdered.
Sassy, put on some pants.
You've got a sweet bottom, but the only bottom I'm interested in right now is the bottom of this case, and getting to it.
Because this time, it's personnel.
Cut! [bell rings.]
Did you want me to say, "This time it's personal"? No, that's a clichÃ©.
You're saying it's an inside job.
Someone on the force.
"This time, it's personnel.
" Ah, okay.
The strangling looks fake.
Ooh, maybe it would be scarier [wailing.]
if I talked like this I already told you.
No spooky voice! I can roll my eyes back and stick my tongue out.
[gagging.]
Eh? Yeah, let's try that.
Gina, you noticed anything funky about these new scripts? Yeah.
Without Diane around to police Flip's use of the word "literally," you'd think "the literally store" was going out of business.
Figuratively.
What? No.
I mean the story with the chief.
I think it's stolen from my life.
I mean, I also had a male boss who died.
Herb Kazazz.
Seems like a coincidence.
The chief is named Basil.
Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.
I don't think anyone would use a story from your life without telling you.
Diane would.
She's not writing on the show anymore.
You think Flip read her book? Wait a minute.
"Her book.
" "Herb ook.
" What's going on with you? I'm gonna get to the bottom of this because this time, it's business.
Personal business.
[typing.]
[knocking on door.]
Hey, friend.
Where'd you get your ideas from? I'm just I'm so interested in your process.
Do you make them up, or get inspired by other things or people's lives? What are you accusing me of? You think I can't come up with my own ideas? Those popsicle guys signed a release.
Popsicle guys? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? [both.]
Hmm [BoJack.]
Something's going on.
I must be singing a song called "Crazy" because everyone's treating me like a patsy.
All I know for sure is Flip's hiding something.
Something about "popsicle guys.
" Hey, buddy.
Is everything okay in here? Yeah, fine.
Really? Because this trailer belongs to Stingray Liotta.
[gurgling.]
Oh.
Uh, I guess I've been a little distracted.
Are you sure you're okay? Because you're my friend, and I would never forgive myself if something happened to you that affected our ability to stay on schedule.
What? BoJack, I care about you, and also the 218 other people who will be out of a job if you spin out like you usually do.
Now are you keeping things together? I'm not gonna screw up this professional opportunity for you.
Your concern is very touching.
What's in those pills you keep taking? If you really cared, you should've been there the day I fell off a building? But no.
You had other important business to attend to.
BoJack You're doing a great job, making me feel like you give a shit.
You're gonna be an awesome mom.
[sighs.]
I think you're overworked.
Oh, for real? With a side order of, "Ya think?" And sundry retorts of that fashion.
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna take the rest of the night off.
You're gonna get some sleep.
And when you come back, you're gonna be professional, you're gonna be courteous, and you're gonna have your shit together.
Fine! And I'm sorry, about the mom thing.
Get some sleep.
[sighs.]
I can't sleep.
Ugh.
Yeah, you mentioned.
Flip was acting very suspicious.
He sure was.
Eight hours ago.
But we're home now, and it's 4:00 in the morning.
Princess Carolyn's getting all up in my business! She told me that I seem "not okay," and was "spinning out," and "would make a great mom.
" Not sure you'd be the best mom.
I'd be a wonderful mother! Wow.
[thinking.]
Watch it, BoJack.
You're losing it.
Gotta be cool for Gina.
What's something a cool person would say? Uh, hey, Daddy-O.
Gotta splitsville to the lavatory if you catch my drift.
Hang ten! Oh, okay.
Nailed it.
[panting.]
[sighs.]
Huh? [clicking.]
[Gina.]
BoJack, I know what's going on.
[switch clicks.]
[gasps.]
Uh you do? You're taking the character home with you.
It happens to every actor.
I played a girls' PE coach who solved mysteries in a pilot called, Death, She Whistles.
It never went to series, but I got so into it, I spent months ordering every mouthy teen I saw to drop and give me 20.
Yeah, you're probably right.
[sniffs, slurps.]
[gasps.]
[groans.]
[gasps, moans.]
[music playing.]
[vocals singing backwards.]
[music stops.]
Uh? [faint fluttering.]
[gasps.]
[gasps.]
[BoJack narrating.]
The BoJack Mysteries will continue after this.
[orchestral music playing.]
[puffing.]
Hello.
I hope you're enjoying Philbert.
Is everyone having a good time? Uh [music stops.]
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm in a real situation here because I did not realize I was supposed to sell ads for this show.
Nobody specifically told me that was under the purview of the president of ad sales! So, if anyone wants to buy 30 million dollars'worth of ad time, or work out some sort of licensing arrangement, basically, what you need to know about me is I am desperate and will say yes to anything.
Let the negotiations begin! [music resumes.]
And now, back to the show.
[BoJack thinking.]
Who sent this? What do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out.
Hey, BoJack! Did the L.
A.
Gazette come today? Apparently, I'm on their "35 Over 35 but Under 40" list.
Uh, no, nothing came today! I wasn't looking at anything.
Why are you so insistent that something came today? Obsessed with things coming much? Whatever this creep has on me could ruin the show, And there goes Gina's newfound happiness.
I gotta find out who sent this.
For her sake.
This case is like the movie, Love Actually.
No leads.
Hope the coroner can help us out.
She will.
We got a lot of history, me and the coroner.
Here's a picture.
She used to be one of my closest friends.
Used to? Times change.
[splatters.]
[BoJack.]
Diane! Diane! Diane! I know you sent me the note! What note? What note? The one you slipped under my door.
See, great actors embody their roles, so I've picked up some detective skills.
That letter "I" is in a nerd font.
I'd say it's from The Believer.
And you're the only person who reads The Believer.
First of all, The Believer is a very popular $12 magazine.
And I didn't send this dumb note.
You love revealing my secrets.
And not sharing your cobbler! [sighs.]
Who else could have done it? I don't know.
Who'd you piss off? [thinking.]
She's right.
Lotta people have it out for me.
[Philbert narrating.]
But who the hell would want to hurt the chief? Hey, Philbert.
This your friend? [gasps.]
A second strangling victim.
If it's the same killer, he's a real pain in the neck.
Hey, there's being sassy, and there's going over the line with humor.
Literally.
All right, enough chokes.
Let's put together a list of suspects.
Yeah, suspects.
[Philbert.]
Gotta keep it together and go through the suspects.
[rattling.]
[thinking.]
Who would wanna take down BoJack Horseman? [clicks.]
Huh.
No.
Don't call Charlotte.
That's a terrible idea.
Don't do it.
[ringing.]
Hello! Charlotte's husband Kyle here! [Kyle.]
Hello? Hello, hello, hello? This is your last chance, okay? Three, two Uh All right, you get another second here.
What's going on? I'm doing a survey for the cable company.
All right.
I've got time for a survey.
Kinda fun to think big-time corporations care about what little old Kyle thinks.
[speaking with mock Scottish accent.]
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your cable service? Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.
Let's see.
Don't take this personally, but I'm gonna say eight.
And on a scale of one to ten, how is your marriage? Well, that's a little personal, don't ya think? Oh, okay.
Uh But I guess if it helps your survey My wife and I had some rough patches, but we're stronger now we've got through them.
I'm gonna give us an eight.
Okay, so it sounds like your wife isn't obsessed with a desire to exact revenge on a former friend? What? For cable-related reasons or otherwise? I don't think so.
Okay, wonderful.
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your daughter's sexual maturity? Boy, that's a sticky one.
I'm just reading what's in front of me.
Pfft.
I don't even know how to judge that.
Uh, let's say that one is, "Horribly scarred by an older man she trusted and is now dedicated to getting the word out about the bad thing he did," [normal voice.]
and ten is, "Slowly explored her body in a healthy way on her own timetable and is now completely emotionally well-adjusted?" I don't know, maybe eight? I feel like I'm kind of defaulting to eights.
Okay, thanks, bye! Wait! Don't go.
I got a couple questions.
Question number one.
What channel is Netflix? Gotta get back to Scotland.
You're the man now, dawg.
Well, that didn't pan out.
We got no leads, and the Olive Garden won't deliver.
Sure, when you're there, you're "family.
" There's gotta be something we're not seeing.
All these victims, strangled.
Yeah, this case just gets strangler and strangler.
You made puns! You could laugh after two murders.
But now we're talking about eight innocent people killed in five days! This guy's really going full throttle.
[chuckles.]
I guess it's just funnier when I do it.
The point is, we have to stop him.
[sighs.]
So many people could have sent that note.
Why do so many people hate me? Oh, put up a picture of Crispin Glover.
Apparently, I spilled coffee on his shirt in a dream he had.
I'm not sure production assistants are supposed to help make lists of enemies.
Hey, if you're gonna whine like that, put your own picture on the wall too.
Oh, shit, what time is it? I gotta get to set.
We are on set.
Oh, yeah.
We are, in fact, on set.
[buzzing, popping.]
[Flip.]
I'm telling you, BoJack's onto us! [Princess Carolyn.]
Oh, he's not onto anything.
[Flip.]
I think he knows about the popsicle guys! Wha? Pickles, about dinner tonight, am I any network with a show starring Kyle Bornheimer? Because I have to cancel.
Shh, shh, shh! Nothing's wrong.
Just another heavy night of shooting.
Sha-sha-shh! Gotta go! Love you! Shh! Shh! Love being monogamous! [phone beeps.]
[sighs.]
Hey, BoJack! Look at you, skulking behind doors with a malevolent aura.
Someone is hiding something.
How did you know? Did you talk to Diane? Yes.
I did talk to Diane.
BoJack, I promise it was a one-time thing.
The worst thing that could happen is if I lost your respect over this.
I couldn't live with myself if your respect for me fell any lower than the current level of respect you have for me, which as we both know is very high.
Can we pretend this whole thing never happened? What whole thing? Thank you.
There's gotta be a simple explanation.
No.
I'm telling you, this whole thing is rotten, Gina.
[Flip.]
You said "Gina" again! What? You called her "Gina.
" The character's name is "Sassy.
" Right.
Um, no.
This whole thing is rotten, Sassy.
Whatever it is, we'll figure it out together, okay? Okay.
In the morning.
[clicks.]
[Sassy sighs.]
[sighs.]
[pistol clicks.]
[gasps.]
Fritz! We're not so different, you and I.
In fact, in many ways, you might even say we're the same.
Samie, samie, samie-same, you might say.
Twinsies, even.
Fritz, you're not real.
Does this feel real enough for ya? [grunts.]
You don't have to do this.
You can trust me.
I do trust you.
[sighs.]
But I don't trust her.
[grunts.]
Ugh! And that's why I still have a landline.
[yelling.]
[gasps, panting.]
What's going on? I'm a heavy sleeper.
The pieces are starting to fit together.
Literally.
[BoJack thinking.]
He's got a secret he won't tell me.
And he's not alone.
That's why she keeps checking on me To make sure that I'm not getting too close to the truth.
Who else is in on it? Mr.
Peanutbutter.
He's up to something.
Something involving Diane! But what do they all have in Common? They all made Philbert.
This whole show is designed to reveal my secrets and destroy me.
And poor Gina is caught up in the madness.
I have to find a way protect her! Get it? Everyone's evil.
It's a conspiracy to destroy you.
Protect Gina.
Got it.
The Fascinating Mysteries of Detective BoJack Who Is Great will continue after this.
What? I really think we should get to set.
Aren't we on set? You're at home.
I came to get you because you didn't show up at call time.
Why didn't you come earlier? [gasps.]
Are you trying to take me down, too? Down to set.
[Flip groaning.]
[BoJack gasping.]
Hey, everyone! BoJack's here, ready to shoot! What are we waiting for? Come on.
All right, set it up! BoJack, what's going on with you? I can't tell her the truth.
She's safer knowing nothing.
You realize you just said that out loud? Oh.
Sorry.
Too many night shoots.
It's so hard to lie to her.
You just said that out loud, too.
You do know this is real, right? More real than you even know, dollface.
Face.
Clocks have faces.
That's it! [gasping.]
Where the hell is he going? [muttering.]
Gotta get 'em Gotta go.
Gotta catch up.
[yelps.]
Todd Chavez.
The man in charge.
The guy who has a face, which is what clocks have, and also hands, which clocks have, too.
I should have known his clocky-handy face was behind this.
Hi, BoJack! The gif is up, bozzo.
Spill the beefs.
Okay, you got me.
In order to offset the costs of video hosting, I needed to sign a licensing deal with a pharmaceutical company, but I think this still maintains the dignity of Flip's original vision.
"Oopsie, gotta poopsie"? That sounds like a thing Philbert would say, right? We're also doing a board game, a lunchbox, and a campaign with a national taco chain.
The "Philburrito.
" So zesty, you'll forget your murdered wife.
[gasps.]
So, you wrote the note! Uh, no, that's Tell me the truth, Chavez! Have you always been secretly jealous of me? Did you hate that you were a nothing and I was a successful cop? Did you create this entire television show to destroy me? That's a lotta questions, but, generally, no.
This ends now.
Hey, whoa, whoa, careful! Ooh! [beeping.]
Fritz! Put down the gun.
No, BoJack, that's not [Henry Fondle.]
I am going to blow my load! Don't.
Don't pull the trigger! It is imminent! Prepare to exchange fluids.
No! Beep, beep! [groans.]
You're a super gal.
I'll call you.
Fritz is getting away! [grunts.]
BoJack, hold on [grunts.]
[panting.]
[yelps.]
[gasps, yelps.]
[popping.]
[gasps.]
BoJack, what are we doing? What? All this running around.
Gina.
Someone is trying to take me down, take the show down.
So, what, you solve this little mystery, fix this little hole, and then everything will be fine? I'm doing this for you.
You don't want that.
For everything to be fine? How dreadfully boring.
Huh? Life is a never-ending show My friend A twisting, turning, ever-bending show Huh? The audience is everyone you know My friend Leave them with a smile when you go You can bet that you're a star So don't forget how fun you are Get out there and give it your all And don't stop dancing Don't stop dancing 'Til the curtains fall Agh! You are a rotten little cog, mon frÃ¨re Spun by forces you don't understand Living is a bitter, nasty slog Mein herr Why not sell your sadness as a brand? Paint your face and brush your mane And find some place to cut your pain To portions we can buy at the mall And don't stop dancing No, you can't stop dancing 'Til the curtains fall Aw, shucks! [yelps.]
[shoes tapping.]
Today's the day, you've got the spark You'll find a way to make your mark And get your tiny name on that wall So, don't stop dancin', baby Don't stop spinnin' Don't stop beltin', buddy Now we're winnin' Grief consumes you But you just keep grinnin' The ache becomes you And it's just beginning Don't stop dancin' Nothing's certain but the curtain [gasps.]
[panting.]
[sighs.]
Couldn't sleep? I never sleep.
I noticed.
I've noticed you noticing.
I've made some progress in our case, but, uh you're not gonna like it.
Try me.
It's about Fritz.
[clicks.]
[gasps.]
So, I guess some of this detective stuff is starting to rub off on me, because I figured out what's been going on with you.
Gina? I found your stashes in the toilet paper rolls.
Then I looked around the house and found all your other clever little hiding places.
How many of these do you take a day? Hey.
Those are mine.
Okay? I need those.
[Gina gasps.]
I swear to God, you try that again and you're dead.
Sassy, I'm not the bad guy here.
It's Fritz.
I didn't want to tell you this, but he's back.
I don't know how.
Maybe the nuclear blast resurrected him somehow.
You're my partner.
We need to find him.
I'm with Internal Affairs, you moron.
When you told me Fritz killed your wife, something didn't add up.
I tried to find Fritz in the system, but there's no record of him ever existing.
What? In fact, there's no record of you ever having a partner at all.
What are you saying? [grunting.]
You killed your wife.
And the chief.
And the coroner.
And the others.
Why would I do that? Because they knew you, and they knew your secrets.
But I know your secrets now.
But did you know that I love bocce ball? What? [Philbert grunts.]
[Sassy gasps.]
[panting.]
Come on.
Gina.
I'm serious, Gina.
I need those pills! Bullshit.
You have no idea what I'm going through.
I'm trying to protect you, Gina! Protect me from what? Are you serious? Someone is trying to blackmail me.
BoJack, this is from the show.
What? It's marketing.
[Gina.]
Everyone in L.
A.
got one.
Huh.
It's a copy of the note that Philbert gets.
You sent this note.
It was you.
No, Philbert.
[Sassy.]
It was you.
The guilt was unbearable.
It ate you up inside, and drove you to madness.
Bullshit.
Oh? Or should I say no "O.
" [gasps.]
It was you! It was all you! Literally! No! No! You don't remember shooting that scene? Well, I I guess I've been a little distracted.
"Distracted"? You've been high.
No.
It's not high, Gina, that's not It makes things normal.
Normal? You're a goddamn mess, and you're gonna ruin my show.
Oh, your show? That's not what I meant.
No, that's very helpful.
I understand what you're worried about.
I thought it was me, but it's your show.
BoJack, listen.
It would really be a shame if your show was ruined by your boyfriend's debilitating drug problem.
Stop it.
Where would you go to sing with your popsicle dancers? Popsicle dancers? Give me my pills back! No.
So, what happens now? Turn yourself in.
Are you kidding? I know there's a good man buried somewhere in there, Philbert.
He's the man I fell in love with.
That man is dead! [grunts.]
Gina.
I'm not kidding.
The pills.
Now! [bangs.]
You're out of control.
Give them to me! [growls.]
Stop! Let go! You're hurting me! [Gina gasping.]
[grunting.]
[wheezing.]
[Flip.]
Okay, cut! See, that looks real.
I'm going.
Gina, no.
Come on.
Stay away from me.
Get help.
Or don't.
I don't care anymore.
Gina, no.
Uh! [gulps.]
[BoJack grunting.]
[Gina.]
Please, stop.
BoJack, he said, "Cut.
" BoJack? Buddy? I think he's really strangling her.
What? Oh, no.
Turn the camera back on.
Gina, you okay? Okay, that's enough.
[screams.]
[gasps, panting.]
What the fuck is wrong with you? [moans.]
[gasping.]
Uh?
[Todd.]
You shut down production? Just for a couple of days.
What is going on over there? It's a minor injury issue.
A stunt went slightly awry.
Again? And one of our stars got a little strangled.
What? Just a little strangled.
Like, the minimum amount of strangled.
Everyone's fine now.
It's like it didn't even happen.
Except Except what? Some crew members might have taken some video of the incident that could leak to the press at any moment.
But that's it! Okay, I'm pulling the plug.
[Flip.]
What? No! It's too dangerous! We gotta cut our losses.
Cut your losses? Philbert is a monster hit! We put your site on the map, boy-o, so don't get squeamish now about sunk cost.
Face it: You need us like a fish needs a bicycle in Portland, Austin, Boulder, or Minneapolis, Saint Paul! You are out of order.
Fine.
Switch Boulder and Austin and move the Twin Cities to the front.
Now, can you give me a chance to get everything under control? [Henry slams door.]
Yes! Yes! Yes! [Todd sighs.]
You have one more chance.
Do you promise me you can take care of this? I'm clearing my docket.
This is my only priority.
Good, because my boss has made it very clear that if we let him down, he will, quote, "eat my ass for dinner.
" [theme music playing.]
[high-pitched ringing.]
[ringtone playing.]
[phone beeps.]
Hello? Hey, buddy, well, how ya feeling today? Weird.
Am I supposed to be on set right now? You just stay right there.
I'm coming over.
Okay.
Do me a favor, though? Maybe don't watch any TV, or go on the Internet, or take any phone calls from anybody else until I get there, okay? What? [touch tones beeping.]
Ugh.
[line ringing.]
Stuart.
What up? Draft an email to Biscuits Braxby.
I wanna set up an interview for Hold on, I'm getting another call.
You want that part in the email? Hello? Princess Carolyn! It's Sadie.
Remember me? You wanted my baby, and you came down to Eden, then you thought about your past a lot, and I decided not to give you my baby? Of course I remember you, Sadie.
Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.
Anyway, I got to thinking I interviewed a lot of people for adoption.
After I said I wasn't gonna give them the baby, They all went cold or nasty.
Except you.
You were still nice.
[tires screech.]
I think that's a sign.
[grunts.]
How fast can you get to Eden? Why? My boyfriend left me, my mama stole my truck, and I don't want this baby no more.
Oh, fish, Sadie.
I'm kind of in the middle of something now.
You're in the middle of something? I'm about as deep in contractions as an apostrophe! [panting.]
I know.
This is all just coming so fast.
I Let me call you back.
Okay, but if this baby pops out and you're not here, I'm putting it in a dumpster.
[gasps.]
I'm kidding, I'm giving it to someone else.
[grunts.]
Hey.
Hi.
I always forget how tiny and Dickensian this place is.
It's really great how you don't need nice things to be happy.
Yes, I agree.
What do you want? [door closes.]
For the last couple months, I've had work to distract me, but now that we're on strangle hiatus, I can't stop thinking about that "thing" that happened in the prepiere of the Philbert.
"Strangle hiatus?" Diane, stay on topic.
You know what "thing" I'm talking about? Yes.
The thing between us? Got it.
When we had sex? I was on top and then briefly on bottom.
Human-y style? Yep, I remember.
Pickles has no idea, and I've never felt so guilty in my life.
I hate keeping secrets from people.
It's like Rob Schneider's surprise party all over again.
You cheating on your girlfriend is not the same as Rob Schneider's surprise party.
You're right, this is much less sad and involves more people.
Just tell Pickles the truth.
Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.
Could you do it? What? No! But you're so good at bumming people out.
I'm more of a "good news" guy.
You want your ex-wife to explain the fact that you cheated with your ex-wife to your current girlfriend? Well, of course every idea sounds stupid if you describe what it is.
You're not the only one who feels gross about that night.
Do you have any idea how shitty I felt after you left? So I made you feel gross, and now No, you didn't make me anything! I am gross.
I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley, but a barge, floating out to sea, with no rudder.
I am a rudderless burning large garbage barge.
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way all the time, but I don't usually, and now, for the first time ever, I do, and I don't know what to do with that feeling! Good! You should feel bad! Well, I do! Great! Me, too! Great! Great! [both moaning, kissing.]
So, what, exactly, do you think happened last night? Uh I don't know.
We shot some stuff? There was an accident on set and Gina got injured.
Oh, my God, she did? She's fine.
But some footage has gotten out.
Footage? And because of how it looks, some people might get the impression that you were trying to hurt Gina.
They're gonna get the impression.
Right.
But I wasn't.
Of course not.
What did happen? So, the two of you are gonna do a sit-down interview with Biscuits Braxby.
[chuckles.]
She makes news fun! Yes.
All you need to say is that you know the footage looks bad, but you and Gina are actors.
You performed a convincing scene, and you can't wait for everyone to see the new season.
Well, it seems like you've got everything under control.
[sighs.]
I'm sorry things got so messy with the show.
I didn't always look out for you as much as I should have.
I can take care of myself.
I know you've got a lot on your plate.
It's just been so crazy, this adoption process, but I think once I get a baby, my life will be less hectic, you know? Oh, sure.
That is why new mothers always seem so chilled-out and well-rested.
Okay, buddy.
Why don't you save your funny jokes for the interview? But please don't make jokes at the interview.
[both sigh.]
Sorry I broke every piece of furniture you own.
Will 20 dollars cover it? Don't worry about it.
But, yes.
So, what happens now? I don't know.
I have to tell Pickles.
Yeah.
I'll tell her you and I had a talk.
Okay.
And we're getting back together.
Wait, what? But she's a great girl.
No, no.
But she is a great girl.
You just don't know her.
No, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I don't want to get back together with you.
What? I think you misunderstood.
Then why do you keep doing this? Why do you keep doing this? Because I love you! Don't say that.
It's true.
I never stopped loving you.
No.
We can't do this ever again.
I'm sorry.
[sighs.]
See? I told you you were great at giving bad news.
That is not what I wanted to hear.
BoJack, Biscuits.
Biscuits, BoJack.
This interview's gonna go down smooth, like a 1995 Zinfandel.
You ever try one of those '95 zins? Good year for Zinfandels.
Bad year for Oklahoma federal buildings.
M'kay.
Here's how it's gonna go down.
Red light on the camera goes bloop! I go, "Hey!" You go, "Hey!" I go, "Video?" You go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?" You go, "Well" and you roll me through the rigamarole.
Oh, don't Don't forget to plug your show.
Then I go, "Wow.
This has been so illuminating.
Thank you so much.
" Red light goes boo-de-de-boop, we'll be out of here before Traffic.
And, yes, I'm talking about the Stephen Soderbergh movie Traffic.
It's playing on FX tonight, and I'm hoping to catch it.
Love me some Cheadle.
Am I crazy or was she kind of hitting on me? Yeah.
You guys have a real flirty energy, like Matt Lauer and those magazine cut-outs he now interviews in his kitchen.
This should be fun.
Now that's the spirit! You gotta show me this video.
No, I really don't think that's necessary.
I'll look like an idiot if I don't know what I'm talking about.
Just let me see it.
How bad could it be? Cut to: "Ooh, it's really bad!" But, no, seriously, can I see it? [sighs.]
[BoJack grunting in video.]
Hey, wow, look at me go.
[Princess Carolyn's voice.]
BoJack! Oh.
Oh! Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um Well, this looks like Yeah.
Because I'm actually Yeah.
Diane! What have you been up to? Tell me everything.
Actually, I've been working on a book of essays Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite, and it's very rude of you to assume that I care.
I have news that's actually interesting.
Girl Croosh is pivoting to video, and I want you to be the face.
The face? Of the site.
Every woman under 40 will tune in to hear what you have to say.
And possibly women over 40, but we have no way of knowing because they're invisible to our site metrics.
Stefani no.
I don't understand.
My parents never said no to me growing up, so I'm literally incapable of processing it as a concept.
I'm a hypocrite.
I'm miserable and I make other people miserable.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I can't be a trusted news source, or an authority, or a role model for anybody.
Uh, no one called you a "role model.
" Settle down.
Oh.
Um You know what your problem is? You hold everyone to an impossible standard, including yourself.
It's super helpful for writing hot-take shakedowns, and clickbait take-downs, but totally toxic for your personal life and internalized sense of self-worth, girl.
But shouldn't we be asking more of ourselves and of the people in our lives? Of course.
But we all fail, Diane.
The world is unforgiving enough as it is.
The least we could do is find ways to forgive each other and ourselves.
Well, then maybe we should be more forgiving in our content, and maybe not publish so many take-downs? Oh, Diane.
All right, let's bring in the talent.
[mumbling.]
[gasps.]
Hey, is this a good time to talk? No, Stuart.
This is a very bad time.
We're about to shoot the interview.
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorized your schedule.
You could write it down.
With what, a quill? Okay, Elbridge Gerry.
What? Anyway, this lady showed up at the office and she was being super annoying, so I brought her here.
What lady? [gasps.]
Hey.
Why aren't you answering your phone? Why aren't you in North Carolina? We're having a bit of a PR crisis.
As soon as this is settled I will take the first plane there, but this is just not the best time.
Look, if you can't do this, don't do it.
My mom worked all the time and she never made time for me.
I felt so alone growing up, especially because I never knew my dad or my twin brother because our parents broke up when we were babies, and wouldn't even talk to each other.
Oh, Tracy, I had no idea.
My whole life, all I had was this half of a medallion with part of a family crest on it.
The crest of a family I'll never know.
Boring.
Ex-squeeze me? Sorry, but your story sucks.
I mean, who wasn't separated from their family as a baby and still wears their half of a medallion in the hopes of one day being reunited with their long-lost twin? That exact thing happened to me and you don't see me bitching about it.
God, get over yourself.
Get over yourself.
I didn't realize it was a common thing.
Well, obviously it is, so can you get to your point already? I was getting to it if you'd quit talking already.
My point is, not every woman is supposed to be a mother.
Maybe you'd be happier if you freed yourself from that expectation, and just lived the life you'd clearly rather be living.
Two minutes to air! No, that's not I'm not I can't even deal with this right now.
You need to leave.
All right, let's go.
She's in one of her moods.
I still think it's pretty nutty we both have the left half of a medallion.
Like, what are the odds? Nah, it's a completely different thing with me.
Mine is the right half.
So Oh, okay.
[exhales.]
[clears throat.]
Hey.
Hello, BoJack.
Are you okay? You look good.
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.
Gina, I'm so sorry.
Let's just do the interview, okay? I'm gonna come clean about everything.
What? Everyone needs to know what I did.
[bell rings.]
[man.]
Please get in positions.
No.
Don't do that.
Gina, what I did to you I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.
I'll say it was pretty bad.
It was assault.
Yeah.
You physically overpowered me, and if there were any justice, you would be in jail right now.
Okay, so But my career, after so many failed attempts, is finally starting to take off.
I am getting offers, and fan mail, and magazine columns about what a good actor I am.
People know me because of my acting.
And all that goes away if I'm just the girl who got choked by BoJack Horseman.
I can't lie about this.
I don't want you to be the most notable thing that ever happened to me.
I don't want you to be the question I get asked in interviews for the rest of my life.
Gina, I You need to do this for me, okay? Because I just want this to be over.
Can we talk about it, maybe after the interview? No.
I will be civil to you on set when we have scenes together, but otherwise, I never wanna think about you again.
Hey, guys, how are we doing? So good, Biscuits.
We're so excited to be here, aren't we, BoJack? Um, yeah.
[buzzer blares.]
I'm here with BoJack Horseman and Gina Cazador, stars of the hit show Philbert.
Let's cut to the chase.
That video.
[chuckles.]
Oh, my God, it's so embarrassing.
This is all a misunderstanding.
I mean, it's kind of hilarious.
We've actually been laughing about it here on set! [both chuckling.]
Really? BoJack looks so angry in the video.
And Gina, you look terrified.
Biscuits, we're actors.
It's what we do.
Oh, thank God.
Yep, actors.
Okay, I gotta ask.
Is the story true? Are you two an item? [laughs.]
Busted! Oh, boy.
Looks like you got your scoop! Can you give us a kiss? Uh Sure thing.
[kisses.]
What's it like dating your co-star? It's so great.
I'll bet sometimes, though, you wanna strangle each other, right? Oh, you bet! [BoJack chuckles.]
[Gina growling.]
Okay, you two.
This has been illuminating.
Thank you so much.
[bell rings.]
[man.]
That's a cut! That was amazing.
[Gina.]
Mm-hmm.
[sighs.]
You wanted to see me, Mr.
Fondle? [Henry.]
I must make love to you.
[chuckles.]
You mean to my brain, because I have such good ideas.
Thanks for the encouragement.
I never got that at my last job.
[Henry.]
Nice boobs.
That's exactly right.
Those guys were nice, but they were total boobs.
Anyway, I'm gonna go review the third quarter budget with our diagnostics team.
[Henry.]
Insufficient power.
To review the budget? [panel beeping.]
[Henry.]
Insufficient power.
Are you saying I don't have the authority to do my job? [Henry.]
Now entering sleep mode.
You wanna sleep with me? That is not a mode I'm comfortable with, Mr.
Fondle.
[Henry.]
Please connect to power source! [gasps.]
So first, he said I had insufficient power Wow.
Which I have never heard him say to a man.
And then he asked me to "connect" to his "power source.
" Did you feel physically threatened? Was there any implication of assault? Not assault, but he did make a mention of "low battery".
It is never acceptable to threaten an employee with battery at any level.
What time is it right now? For female employees of one popular website, the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock! What started with the allegations of one junior executive has quickly snowballed into an avalanche of accusation, as women at every level have come forward with their own harrowing stories of what happens when the big hand meets the little hand.
He said he wanted to "get all up in my guts with his penis and ejaculate inside me.
" At the time, I just thought it was typical corporate banter, but now I'm like, uh Look, obviously, men should not be engaging in predatory behavior at the office, but I'm worried now the pendulum's gonna swing too far in the other extreme where they'll be held accountable for that behavior, and that's not ideal.
Uh, Henry Fondle is a sex robot, and he should not be a CEO of any company.
[reporter.]
When you say "sex robot," you're speaking metaphorically, right? No.
The board has taken decisive action to remove Henry Fondle by placing him on an indefinite paid leave.
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back, canceling our slate of streaming series and refocusing on our original mission of being a website you can go to if you don't know what time it is, that also doesn't harass anyone.
This is a great day for the women of this company, many of whom will be laid off.
[reporters clamoring.]
[camera shutter clicking.]
So, you got a call from your dentist; no cavities.
Emily Van Camp wants to move your four o'clock to five.
And also, Todd wanted me to let you know that the network folded, everyone got fired [yawns.]
And your show is canceled.
What? It's over.
It's all over.
What are you talking about? It's not over.
We just have to find our baby another home.
Maybe What Time Is It Right Now is gone, but there are like a billion other websites, right? What about that website you go to, to pay your parking tickets? Or if we're really desperate, TNT? The point is we're just getting started, Princess Carolyn! [door grinds.]
Princess Carolyn? [phone rings.]
She's gone.
Unless I was Princess Carolyn the whole time.
Mm.
[in female voice.]
Oh, fish! Well, this is it, Henry Fondle.
The end of the line.
[man.]
Hiya, hotshot.
I've been following your career pretty closely and I like what I see.
How'd you like a corner office at Disney-Fox-AT&T-AOLTime-Warner-Pepsico-Viacom-HalliburtonSkynet-Toyota-Trader-Joe's? [Henry.]
Give it to me! Uh, you know this guy just got fired for sexual harassment, right? Yeah, so he's learned his lesson and he's ready to reenter the workforce.
[Henry.]
I have many penises.
[chuckles.]
You said it, buddy.
Give us a call.
Do you wanna take a ride? There's something I wanna show you.
[Henry.]
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! [knocking on door.]
Oh, hello.
Shouldn't you be out "not really strangling" someone? The last time I saw you, you said you still believed I could be a better person.
Do you still believe that? I do.
I need you to write one of your take-downs.
About me.
What? You can't write anything about Gina, but the other stuff.
Everything.
I need to get it out.
No.
I'm done writing about you, or for you, or with you.
Diane, please, I need this.
I'm a bad guy and the world needs to know.
There's no such thing as "bad guys" or "good guys.
" We're all just guys who do good stuff sometimes and bad stuff sometimes.
And all we can do is try to do less bad stuff and more good stuff, but you're never going to be good.
Because you're not bad.
So, you need to stop using that as an excuse.
I am asking to be held accountable.
And I'm telling you it's not gonna happen.
Whatever you put in that story, no one is gonna "hold you accountable.
" You need to take responsibility for yourself.
I don't know how to do that! [Diane sighs.]
[BoJack grunting.]
[sighs.]
This is it.
My special thinking spot.
[Henry.]
Let us put on a Lionel Richie album, and finger each other's holes.
Shh.
Henry, no.
There'll be time for that later.
[Henry.]
I love it when you call me Father.
That's right.
[Henry.]
I I [grunts.]
[Henry.]
I love you, Fatheeeeeer [powers down.]
Shh.
It's okay.
It's over now.
It's all over.
[pants.]
Oh, man.
[grunts.]
Okay.
[Princess Carolyn chuckles.]
Aw.
She's beautiful.
What are you gonna call her? Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.
But not really, though, right? Hey, do you think my cactus is gonna be okay if I'm not there for six weeks? Yeah, I think your cactus is gonna be okay.
Is this a mistake? No.
Wow, it feels so weird to be eating here.
So, this is what it's like from the other side.
Pickles, I took you here because I wanted you to be somewhere you felt comfortable.
Aw, that's so sweet, Mister.
Because I need to talk to you about something.
Oh, no, this is really bad.
Why would you do this to me? I didn't tell you what it is.
No one ever "needs to talk" about something good! No one ever says, "I need to talk to you: Happy Birthday" or, "I need to talk to you: Felicity Jones hired a new stylist and her red carpet looks this season are to die for!" Well, good news first: Felicity Jones did hire a new stylist, but sadly, her fashion choices just aren't popping.
Oh, no! This is bad news! Well, thank you for telling me.
That isn't the thing I was going to tell you.
There's more bad news? Is it worse or not as bad as the Felicity Jones thing? Well, it's different Whatever it is, we're going to get through it together.
Whatever it is, I love you, and nothing's going to change that.
Nothing you say is going to make me stop loving you, no matter what.
Pickles I What is it? [grunts.]
Will you marry me? [squeals.]
What do I say when I go in? You say, "Hello.
I am BoJack.
Horseman, obviously.
You've probably heard of me.
I'm very famous.
So Sober me up, please!" What if I get sober and I'm still the same awful person I've always been, only more sober? I think that is a very real possibility.
Don't be shitty.
I'm not.
Rehab is not a cure-all that's gonna suddenly make you not an asshole.
Then why are we doing this? Let's turn around and go home.
You wanna go home? Is that okay? Look, you have two options.
You can go back home and try to do things your way, like you've been doing all your life, or you can see what these guys have to offer.
I don't understand why you're being so nice to me.
After everything you know about me, all the shit I put you through.
When I was in high school, I had this friend.
Abby.
She was my only friend and we did everything together, until she got adopted by the cool kids and then she turned on me so fast.
She used every secret she knew about me, every vulnerability.
She made me miserable my entire sophomore year.
But then that summer when her mom got sick, like really sick, and all her cool friends were off vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, I was there for her.
Why? Because I'm an idiot.
And it was Abby.
And I hated her, and I will never forgive her, but she needed me and she was my best friend and I loved her.
And now you're here, and I hate you, but you're my best friend, and you need me.
[inhales, exhales.]
You know what you're gonna say? You wanna practice? I'm gonna say, "Hello.
I am BoJack Horseman.
Obviously, you know who I am, because I'm very famous, and also we called ahead.
And I am here because I need help.
" [chuckles.]
[door opens, closes.]
[car door closes.]
[sighs.]
[music playing.]
Sarah Lynn.
Sarah Lynn? [stammers.]
I don't have a lot to tell.
She called me.
She sounded a little off.
I [sighs.]
So, I drove to the planetarium, and I found her passed out.
I called 911 right away, but it was too late.
[crickets chirping.]
I'm so sorry.
[cries.]
I did everything I could.
It's my fault.
I'm a terrible mother.
No.
It's no one's fault.
[sobs.]
So, you don't know where Sarah Lynn got the heroin from? I have no idea.
Alrighty then.
That's the only question I had.
I mean, of course I knew she was doing a lot of drugs.
But that's who she was.
Who I was.
It felt like we could keep partying forever and it wouldn't catch up with us.
Got it.
Don't need any more information.
I was in a bad way.
And Sarah Lynn followed me down because she thought I was a safe place.
What have I done? Just to be clear, the case is closed.
You can stop rambling.
[whistles tune.]
I gotta make some changes in my life.
Starting now.
[bottles clink.]
[gulping.]
I need help.
Hello? Ah! Checking in.
Welcome to Pastiches Malibu! Great.
I see you have the six-week package, so A hundred thousand dollars, please! A hundred thou Jesus! Does every room come with a free bag full of $90,000? Can't put a price on clean living.
And yet somehow you found a way.
Before I take you to your room, could we get a selfie? What? No.
Every client that comes here takes a picture with me.
Goes on the wall.
Kind of a tradition.
I'm not in the mood.
I look awful, first of all.
Johnny Depp did it and he looked just as puffy and ghoulish as you do.
Hey, groundhog.
I said no.
Why don't you go see your own shadow so I can get six more weeks of "Leave Me The Hell Alone"? I'm so sorry, sir.
Thank you.
Now if you'll kindly direct me to my room, I would like to begin the process of healing, so I can finally stop hurting the people around me, dipshit! You throw a record on And your heart is racin' You start to move around While you dance in place And you think you're never wrong Oh, but you're so-so, honey [grunts.]
Oh, yeah, you're so-so, honey [yawns.]
[grunts.]
You start to sing along And your foot is tappin' I see you look around I caught you peeking at me You think you got it all Oh, but you're so-so, honey Oh, yeah, you're so-so, honey If I knew I waited too long I'd find a song to push the time along Change works so well for you 'Cause you're so-so, honey Oh, yeah, you're so-so, honey [music stops.]
[music resumes.]
You throw a record on And your heart is racin' You start to move around While you dance in place And you start to sing along Your foot is tappin' Oh, you're so-so Oh, yeah, you're so-so, honey [pants, sighs.]
Oh.
So, when I went to the country club for Sheila's luncheon Yes.
Let it out.
I had to wear the same suit I had just worn to Sandra's tea party.
Yeah.
[woman.]
Oh.
I think of that as my rock bottom.
[sobs.]
Denise, thank you for sharing your story.
So brave.
Denise, we are powerless over our addictions Uh-huh.
We have a saying in rehab, "Everyone takes a different road to get to the same city, Soberopolis, USA.
" Hold on a sec.
What? BoJack, maybe you could tell us when was the first time you drank? When wasn't the first time I drank? Am I right? [all laugh.]
Your last day's tomorrow.
You think you're ready to go back into the world? I do.
I feel good, I feel clear.
You know, just because you cleaned the tobacco out of your teeth don't mean it's your wedding day, pardon the expression.
I don't believe that is an expression.
I notice you tend to deflect whenever I ask you about the source of your addiction.
I don't deflect.
Hey, is that a new tie? Because I love it.
You understand a joke about deflection is still a deflection, right? I came here to take responsibility for myself, and all I keep hearing is, "It's not your fault, you are powerless over your addiction.
" That is the first step.
And while we're at it, why 12 steps? That is way too many.
Nobody wants to do 12 of anything.
Did you see 12 Years a Slave and think, "Twelve.
That's a short number of years to be a slave.
" You're deflecting again.
I'm here because I made choices.
Nobody made me drink.
My addiction didn't pull a knife on me and say, "Hey, bub! Drink this alcohol or I'm gonna strangle you.
After I put down this knife, which now seems unnecessary.
" We have a saying in the sober community.
No kidding.
"We want what our addictions want us to want, in the same way that our future is just a house built from the materials of our present on the blueprint that is our past.
" See, usually the point of sayings is they illustrate complicated concepts via straightforward allegory.
I really admire that your sayings don't do that.
If you don't wanna be here, you don't have to wait until tomorrow.
The gate code is 12, for the number of steps, then my mom's birthday, which is March 4th, '56.
So, the gate code is one, two, three, four, five, six? You can leave whenever you'd like.
But is that really what you want? [sighs.]
No.
It's so beautiful.
And I know a lot about art because my husband owns a Jackson Pollock.
[chuckles.]
My dad owns a signed picture of Kevin Pollak.
[yelps.]
What about you, BoJack? Did you grow up in a house with a lot of art? Well, my parents practiced the art of being terrible parents.
[laughter.]
BoJack, you can't joke your way through this.
Everyone else in this group is trying hard to be honest.
Really? Everyone's being honest? Doug over here, who keeps dressing in a suit and tie even though he's never getting his finance job back? [woman gasps.]
Oh! Savage! And Joan Tripplehorn? We all know you're just Jeanne Tripplehorn wearing fake glasses! [all gasp.]
[chuckles.]
What? No! I'm Jeanne's identical twin Joan.
Mm, Jeanne Tripplehorn.
Not an alcoholic.
And that guy with the fake mustache is obviously actor Jay Hernandez who's just here to do research for a role.
[all gasp.]
No.
I'm a no "Hernandez.
" Like I say, my name is Mario.
Directed by Zack Snyder.
I'm addicted to pain pills from breaking too many bricks on my head.
BoJack's right! You all suck! Yeah, well, let's talk about Jameson.
Uh I'd rather you not.
She would love to get sober but still has her friend McCaitlyn sneak her water bottles filled with vodka every visiting day.
[all gasp.]
Jameson? Um Have you been smuggling in alcohol? How is this my fault? I blame water for being vodka-colored! This is your fifth time in rehab.
Maybe it's a sign it's not working, huh? BoJack Everyone, just as a general rule, if you're checking into rehab more than once, either you're a lost cause [all gasp.]
or this is just an industry that profits off of repeat customers, so maybe they don't have your best interest at heart.
Oh! How's that for honest? Mamma mia.
[blows.]
[door opens.]
Hey, snitch! I only sneak in vodka because I have to make it through six weeks of this bullshit.
I don't even need to be here.
My dad totally overreacted when he found me not breathing.
Yeah, it's always someone else's fault, right? You have no idea what I've been through.
I know everything you've been through.
I listen in group! Your mom died of cancer.
Your dad stuck you in boarding school and remarried.
And now there's a new baby and no one pays attention to you.
But it's not his fault you're drinking in rehab.
I was sober for most of last year and he just waited for me to slip up so he could ship me here so I wouldn't embarrass him and ruin his new perfect family Hey, if you don't wanna be here, the gate code is one, two, three, four, five, six.
You could sneak out the upstairs window after midnight bed check by tying your sheets into a rope and nobody would notice you're gone until wake up.
But is that what you really want? Ugh! [door closes.]
[studio audience laughing.]
Holy sheet! I've heard of being at the end of my rope but this is ridiculous! Why would Sabrina run away like that? Because I had to break it to her that you weren't going to be her new mommy, international supermodel Cindy Crawfish! When I was flying to Paris for Paris Fashion Week and my private plane crashed into your backyard, the one thing I never expected was to find someone so special.
Oh.
[both chuckle.]
[audience.]
Aw! Cut! That's a five, everyone! [bell ringing.]
So, look, you're doing everything great.
I'm loving your instincts, it's dead on, couldn't be better, perfect.
The one problem is the kiss got an "aw.
" It's supposed to get an "Ooh!" Right? I'm nervous, okay? This is my first on-camera kiss and it's with Cindy Crawfish.
You know how many guys would kill to be in your shoes? What do I gotta do? Kiss you on the lips myself to show you what a real kiss looks like? [kisses.]
Ha-ha-ha! No.
I'll handle it.
Well, I sure as hell hope so.
[gulps.]
Mm.
Hey, what's in this orange juice? Just a little extra punch.
Oh.
No, no, I don't Trust me.
It'll loosen you up.
The one thing I never expected was to find someone so special.
[Cindy.]
Hmm! [audience.]
Ooh! [Herb.]
Love it! Cut and scene! [bell ringing.]
Hey, no way, the party's just beginning.
Let's do one more take! You up for more acting, Cindy? [audience whooping.]
Well, if it's for the show.
Hey, Sharona, how 'bout some more of that OJ? [Jameson grunting.]
Whoa! Ow.
Huh? [panting.]
Holy sheet.
I've heard of being at the end of my rope, but this is very serious! [exhales.]
Jameson! Don't cut the string that connects you to the kite that is you! [scoffs.]
What? I don't know! I was just trying to come up with one of those dumb rehab sayings! McCaitlyn told me Dathan was thinking of breaking up with me because I got fat junior year.
So, I need to go show him that I'm back to being hot.
Then break up with him for being a shallow buck foy! You don't need to do that.
Oh, what does it matter? We both know this place is bullshit! So, why do you care what I do? Because I'm the idiot who helped you escape.
So, if you OD tonight, then I'm the one who'll have to lie to everyone about what happened.
Well, I'm going.
You can come with me if you want.
[sighs.]
God damn it.
[party music playing.]
[Jameson chuckles.]
Oh! This is your boyfriend's house? You can't go in there.
I'll be fine.
I'll just find Dathan, crush him with my thigh gap, and then we can go.
[sighs.]
Okay.
Dathan? Where are you? It's me, Jameson H.
! [people laughing.]
[gasps.]
[panting.]
[panting continues.]
[knocking on door.]
[boy.]
Hey, who's in there? Um Is someone having sex in there? I think there are people having sex in there.
Hey, it was just the nerd.
Definitely no one having sex in here.
[thuds.]
[grunts.]
Um.
Oh.
Mm.
You're BoJack from Spanish 1, right? Uh, yeah.
I mean, sÃ­! [chuckles.]
Okay.
"SÃ­" ya around.
[chuckles.]
Ah, yeah, bye, Katie.
Ugh.
Hey! You want a beer, Horseman? Oh, no, thank you.
I mean, drinking's cool, it's just that we're underage and, you know, the law.
I'm lifting 178 right now.
[keg clangs.]
[chuckles.]
You know what? I'll have one beer.
[pops.]
Okay, who am I? Who am I? "I'm Eric from chemistry class!" [laughter.]
That's so Eric! [chuckles.]
He is so in chemistry class! Speaking of losers, there's Josh! Look, he's wearing K-Mart shoes because his family's poor! [laughter.]
Katie's not laughing because she always thinks she's better than everyone.
Hey, remember last year when one of Katie's boobs grew bigger than the other? [groans.]
"Look at me, I'm Katie!" [laughter continues.]
[Katie sobs.]
Hey, you want some? Oh, yeah.
Bartender, one more.
[sighs.]
[Jameson screaming.]
[gasps.]
What's wrong? Dathan's sucking McCaitlyn's face! Oh, my God.
Jameson.
Okay.
It is not what it looks like, I swear.
You're still doing it! I tried to make it easy on you, Jameson.
[both moaning.]
I told you things weren't going great.
Oh, Dathan, touch my boob.
Do not touch her boob! Jameson, it's not my fault you're a mess.
I mean, how many times have you been to rehab? Yeah, Jameson.
[cries.]
[Dathan and McCaitlyn moaning.]
[crying.]
Look, it's okay.
You were gonna break up with him anyway.
And your friend sucks.
No, they're right.
I'm a mess.
And no one cares.
God damn it! I might as well drink.
No.
You don't need a drink.
[grunts.]
You need to get back to bed and get some sleep.
You're right.
I'm gonna go home and sleep in my bed! And when my dad shows up to ask why I'm not in rehab, I'll be like, "Maybe you should go to rehab for your addiction to being a shitty dad, Dad!" Okay, Jameson, you need to be responsible for yourself.
Now, I think that you should come back to Pastiches with me like you promised.
But if you wanna go to your dad's house, all you have to do is steal Dathan's car, and I heard Michele with one "L" is about to jump naked into the pool, so everyone's gonna be distracted, which means this is the perfect time.
But is that really what you want? [car engine revving.]
[Jameson.]
Bye, BoJack! Thanks! What the God damn it! [grunts.]
Stupid [mumbling.]
Oh.
[touch tones beeping.]
[buzzing.]
[sniffs.]
Hello? I need you to find the address of some rich guy.
BoJack? All I know for sure is that he's the father of a girl named Jameson, who's super annoying.
I'm going to assume you have a good reason to locate a girl in the middle of the night, but I can't help you.
Fine! Be that way.
Todd'll help me.
Can you patch me through to Todd? What? Call him yourself.
I don't know his number.
I only remember your number because it was such a dumb number with all those fours.
Four, four, six, four My phone number has a normal amount of fours.
You are not gonna make me self-conscious about And it ends with a three! Talk about an anti-climax! What kind of phone number ends with a three? Shut up about my phone number! Hold for Todd.
[beeps.]
Todd's phone.
Your one-stop shop for all your Todd-related needs.
Todd, I need you to track down an address for me.
You're the world's best hacker, right? Yeah, but not the kind of hacker you're thinking of.
Funny story Okay, I gotta go.
I'm at Coachella Uh-huh.
Put my name on the wrong list, suddenly I've entered into a hacky sack competition! Right.
Prior to these events, I've never hacked a sack in my life.
Uh-huh.
But the only other contender is the Russian ringer they flew in special, so I'm thinking, "I've gotta win this for America!" Uh-huh.
Long story short, the Russian had a heart attack, so I won by default! Uh, does that answer your question? I don't remember my question, but I'm gonna guess no.
Oh, hold on, I'm getting another call.
[beeps.]
Todd's phone! Spare the Todd, spoil the child! Did you get the black market porcupine milk? Yeah, I'll bring it right over.
Although, I'm not looking forward to getting on a crowded bus in Porcupine Town.
[grunts.]
Hold on.
Getting another call.
[phone buzzes.]
Hey, superstar! How are things goin' on set? Well, the movie itself is coming together beautifully, but when I was on break playing with my model helicopter, it crashed into the studio water tower.
Oh, no! It gets worse! It flooded the set of former VJ Downtown Julie Brown's new puppet show.
What? Completely ruining her vintage goose feather dress she just bought, and disrupting the big finale where her wooden puppet plays Beethoven's fifth on the bongos! Wait.
You're telling me your dumb drone downed a tower and drowned Downtown Julie Brown's dummy drumming dum-dum-dum-dum, dousing her newly found, goose-down, hand-me-down gown? Yes, that is exactly right! I'll be right down.
Todd, I gotta go.
[beeps.]
Hmm.
[beeps.]
[muffled music playing over speakers.]
So, sounds like rehab's goin' well, huh? No! [groaning.]
Hey, give me my phone back.
I'm expecting some timely feedback on an important dick pic.
Hey, do you know where Jameson lives? Jameson H.
? Or Jameson Q.
? Ugh, I don't know.
Or Jameson M.
? Where is the nearest Jameson? [door closes.]
[BoJack.]
Whoa.
Is that the car from Ferris Bueller's Day Off? Yeah, my dad loves movie memorabilia.
And this car is his baby.
At least No, it was his baby before the new baby came.
Now the new baby's the baby, which means the car is the new me, so where does that leave me? Nowhere.
What are you talking about? He threw out all of my stuff and turned my room into the baby's room.
He got rid of my softball trophies, but he loves his stupid bat, naturally.
And his dumb stupid car! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [crying.]
Parents are terrible.
But destroying things isn't gonna change them.
All you can change is you.
Ugh.
Fine.
If I'm gonna get lectured anyway, I may as well go back to rehab.
[glass shattering.]
[woman moans.]
Dad, you there? Mom said since you didn't come home I should bring you your dinner.
And she said to tell you she hopes you like cold, burnt pot roast that was spit on.
[woman moaning.]
Huh? Dad? There it is, coax it out of my sheath.
[gasps.]
BoJack! What the devil! [stammers.]
I'll get right on that memo, Mr.
Horseman.
Okay, let me Oops, oh.
[chuckles.]
Okay, let me just Oh, you look so cute.
Bye-bye.
All right.
What were you doing, Dad? Oh.
It's fun to have you at the office, BoJack.
You're really turning into a man.
I am? I think you're old enough now to have a Jack and Coke.
Mm, nice and sweet.
Here's to our first drink as father and son.
[car horns honking.]
[groans.]
Huh? Did I fall asleep? I feel sick.
[laughs.]
You went a little wild.
You made a mess on my carpet, BoJack.
I think your mother would be very disappointed in you.
I'm sorry.
Maybe it's best if we both just forgot about everything that happened tonight.
Okay, buddy? Okay.
You know what? Screw your dad.
Whoa! Hey! That's the titular club from The First Wives Club.
You're just a kid.
Why do you have to be responsible for all the ways he screwed you up? Yeah! [grunts.]
It's not my fault I was born! He's the one who got my mom pregnant! Yeah, and I bet your mom sucked, too! [gasps.]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Chick ch'ka Oh, no.
Oh, my [thuds.]
[both sigh.]
[car squeaks.]
[glass cracking.]
Wha Oh, boy.
[door opens.]
[baby crying.]
What the hell are you doing? That's the giant window from The Graduate! Oh.
Daddy, I didn't wanna leave rehab, but this scary old horse made me! Hi, cutie! Mwah! Okay, I'm ready to go back to rehab now.
I'll go wait in the car! Jameson [sighs.]
Listen Are you drunk or high? What? Are you drunk or high right now? No.
[sighs.]
I'm sorry she roped you into this.
You're not the first guy to help her break out of that rehab.
They always end up at my house.
And then they want me to keep quiet to the press, so they give me a souvenir from one of their movies.
I could send you a swag bag from Felicity Huffman's Booty Academy, but you should probably wash the thong before wearing it.
I don't know what to do with Jameson.
I've tried everything.
I thought she would change after she had her baby, but [baby cooing.]
Change is hard.
Takes a long time.
[sighs.]
Let me guess, she wanted to see her boyfriend? Actually she told me she just wanted to come here to see her baby.
[sighs.]
Wouldn't that be nice? Bye, Daddy! Love you! Ugh.
Sorry my dad's so embarrassing.
Jesus Christ.
You have no idea how lucky you are.
I wish I had someone when I was your age who cared about me enough to put me in rehab.
Yeah, maybe.
Well, anyway, thanks for keeping me out of trouble tonight.
Really? It was a worth a try.
Ready to sneak back in? I'm getting too old to sneak in and out of places.
All right.
[bell dinging.]
Checking in? No.
I just snuck out and I'm coming back, so, you know, put me down for kitchen clean-up duty or whatever the punishment is for sneaking out.
No, I don't think you've been here before.
Everyone who's been here before is humble enough to take a picture with me.
[sighs.]
Yeah.
Okay.
Sign me up for six weeks.
Starting now.
And a picture? Sure.
Cheese! [camera shutter clicks.]
If there's one thing I've learned from this crazy mambo called life, it's that anyone can be a birthday father, but it takes a heart full of birthdays to be a true Birthday Dad.
Got a heart full of birthday [Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Stop! Go back! There it is.
[snoring.]
Please tell me you guys see that.
[stammers.]
Oh! Looks great! Uh, love it! What's wrong with your face? I just don't buy it, Director Flea Daniels.
That just doesn't look like the honest, trustworthy face of a Birthday Dad.
What? This is clearly the face of a guy who did something terrible, like, I don't know, cheat on his girlfriend with his ex-wife a couple of times and instead of confessing to his girlfriend, asked her to marry him, so now they're engaged, and she still has no idea.
Can't you see he's racked with guilt? It's all over his very handsome face! Did Birthday Dad cheat on his girlfriend? No, I'm just saying he looks like he did.
We have to re-edit the scene.
No.
You've been dragging this out with your ridiculous tweaks and demands for what is the stupidest premise I've ever seen.
I gotta go prep my next film, "The Diary of Anne Frankenstein.
" "Birthday Dad" is over.
Huh? No, I'm over! Over the moon about continuing to work on this project! Go home.
[door opens.]
Wha [sighs.]
Hey, do you wanna keep hanging out? Let's go raid a greeting card aisle and come up with our next project! "Detective John GetWellSoon," "Officer Mike Condolences," "President Blank Inside"! Uh, I should probably get home to my baby.
Oh! Congrats on your new baby is another great idea for a movie! [exhales.]
Yeah.
Sounds like fun.
[toy squeaks.]
[baby crying.]
[sighs.]
[baby crying.]
Oh, Renata, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Third time this week.
I quit.
Oh! No! Renata! Who will take care of Natalie or Needles or whatever her name ends up being? Would you stay if I named her Renata? I understand you are very respected in your field, so I ask you this.
Would you work for a client who has no regard for your time, your personal boundaries, and your general well-being? Yes, that's all my clients.
Well, she is your client now.
Good luck.
[coos.]
[crying.]
Oh.
[grunts.]
Come on.
[echoes.]
Ooh, there ya go.
There ya go.
[echoes.]
[shushing.]
[crickets chirping.]
[sighs.]
[coos.]
[sighs.]
[baby crying.]
[groans.]
Mommy's coming.
[shushes.]
Okay.
Nanny quits.
No sweat.
It just so happens it's "National Take Your Infant Daughter To Work While You Desperately Try To Hire A New Nanny And Neither One Of You Has Slept A Wink Day!" That sounds fun.
I gotta go to a bunch of meetings today.
Or as I call it, Todd-Day.
Todd-Day, yes, I'm aware.
What meetings? After I got fired from "What Time Is It Right Now," suddenly everyone else wanted to meet me.
That's marvelous! Have fun failing upwards! I always do! [grunts.]
[lullaby plays over speakers.]
Come on.
[groans.]
[engine starts.]
[ringing.]
[crying.]
[gasps.]
[phone beeps.]
Hey, there! Shh.
Here ya go.
Sorry, I can tell I'm interrupting your meeting with David O.
Russell, so I'll make this quick.
I'm making a list of people I need to apologize to.
Oh? Yeah.
And I don't wanna waste your time with another apology.
How thoughtful.
But do you remember the name of that assistant from, like, 20 years ago who I screamed at for bringing me a room temp Capri-Sun and told to quit the business? Whatever happened to that guy? Derek? I think he quit the business.
So, I gave him good advice, then? Hey, what do you think of Riley for a girl's name? No good.
I slept with a Riley once.
Didn't end well.
How about Maybe you should not ask me about any women's names.
[elevator dings.]
[baby crying.]
[indistinct chattering.]
Ooh! Loud baby.
Stuart! I need you to clear my schedule for the day.
My number-one priority is finding a new nanny.
Uh-huh.
Also, I was supposed to remind you about the "Manatee Fair" photo shoot for the "Hollywoo Women Who Do It All" issue.
Oh, yeah.
When is that happening? Right now.
What? I was supposed to remind you yesterday.
[groans.]
Princess Carolyn, why am I not looking at your pretty kitty face at my photo shoot, so I can decide later which parts to retouch? I don't think I can make it, Amanda.
Too bad.
Vanessa Gekko's here.
Gekko? Well, that's fine if Vanessa needs to get the word out about her struggling business, but I'm too busy doing it all to pose for a photo of "Women Who Do It All.
" Well, sure, I know that, and you know that, but does the industry? I've got two words for you, Karen Kitada.
[Princess Carolyn.]
The creator of "Med School Nights"? [Amanda.]
Karen Kitada created the number-one show on network television, and its spin-off, "Med School Nights: The Day Shift.
" Everyone wanted to work with her, everyone! She had more overall deal offers than an OshKosh B'gosh outlet.
Then a baby fell out of her! [Princess Carolyn.]
Well, that's [Amanda.]
She took three weeks off.
Three weeks! And when she came back, "Tumbleweeds", "Crickets" And those are just two of the projects she wasn't offered because the studios were dubious about her priorities.
Do you have the right priorities? Of course I do! Then prove it! Leave your work and get your picture taken for my magazine.
If not for you, do it for Karen Kitada.
[Amanda's voice echoes.]
Kitada, Kitada, Kitada [line ringing.]
[ringing.]
[phone beeps.]
Hello? Todd, I have to go to a photo shoot.
I need you to take the baby for an hour or so.
[Todd.]
Well, you know how much I love hanging out with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project Sure, I'd be happy to.
Great.
I'll see you at VIM in 15 minutes.
Um okay? [Amanda's voice echoes.]
Kitada, Kitada, Kitada, Kitada How do you do it all? I just think of myself as having multiple apps running at the same time.
I have my mom app, and my career app, and my wife app, and my yoga body app, and they're all just constantly going, all the time.
Princess Carolyn.
Amanda! Vanessa! You've met my oldest, Yancy Charlemagne? 'Sup.
Charmed.
And where is your little precious ball of wonderful? I didn't know we were supposed to bring our kids.
It's a photo shoot for "Women Who Do It All.
" The kids are part of the "All," otherwise we'd just be "Women Who Do.
" [sighs.]
[phone dialing.]
[phone rings.]
Hello? Todd.
Change of plans.
[Amanda's voice echoes.]
Kitada, Kitada Come on.
Shh.
Please, not now.
And who is this adorable pin cushion? [baby crying.]
I haven't even had a spare minute to think of a name.
It's a lot of pressure.
I don't want my daughter to resent me for the rest of her life because I named her something stupid like [stammers.]
Light Socket.
Aw Don't listen to her, Light Socket.
She's just jealous.
Uh-oh.
Sorry! And what have you been working on that's been keeping you so busy? We just locked picture on "Birthday Dad" with Mr.
Peanutbutter.
That sounds awfully masculine.
Dad, mister Nut? Pean? Right, but I'm producing it, so Strong independent woman.
Doing it all.
Oh, it sounds like you're doing it all for yourself, but the new doing it all is doing it all for other women.
Oh, yeah, well, the twist about "Birthday Dad" is the women have equal screen time to the men in the movie, and the same number of birthdays! Very subversive.
Less man.
More Leslie Mann.
Cut out what you need to.
If it makes sense, that's a bonus.
Gotta go! Ladies, we have got to find time to connect like this more often.
This is so empowering.
We could put together a kind of low-key salon where women exchange ideas and support each other.
With bagels! I'd be more than happy to host, and take care of the caterer, and emcee.
You know, it all! I'll co-host! In that case, why not blow it out? Let's make it an event.
Oh, well Princess Carolyn, VIM has that massive foyer that never has anyone waiting in it.
[gasps.]
You could finally put it to use! We could.
Move that.
That's too close to the wall.
And I happen to know The Fugees have been looking for the right time to do a reunion concert.
Should I call Lauryn? Hill? I call her Lauryn.
A concert? Well, that'll take some time to put together.
Bring it on a little bit.
Move it up a quarter of an inch.
Do you mind? Since it's on your turf, I'll focus on the big-picture stuff and leave all the organization and planning to you.
I wouldn't wanna step on your toes.
We wouldn't want that.
Thanks for stepping up, Princess Carolyn.
Uh-huh [photographer.]
Okay! Watch the birdie! One, two, three! [baby wails.]
[Princess Carolyn shouts.]
[baby crying.]
[Amanda's voice echoes.]
Kitada, Kitada, Kitada, Kitada Do it for Karen Kitada, Kitada, Kitada Do it for Karen Kitada, Kitada, Kitada Do it for Karen Kitada, Kitada, Kitada Do it for Karen Kitada [gasps.]
Ah! [baby hisses.]
[sighs.]
[sighs.]
[baby crying.]
[groaning.]
[phone rings, beeps.]
[wearily.]
Hello? Just wanted to give you a super quick update on all the dietary restrictions for the "Do It All Ball.
" It's a ball now? A ball, a gala, whatever you wanna call it.
It was just supposed to be a bagels.
Bagels.
Balls.
Is this really the Lauryn you want to die on? What? Sorry, I meant hill.
I call her Lauryn.
[giggles.]
Maybe I should call you back when I can write this down.
I'm The Fugees are in, and they love fruit, especially Fuji apples, but they're not fans of Fiji water.
Fuji for The Fugees, but no Fiji.
Got it.
[shushes.]
Marian is a vegetarian, Meagan is vegan, and Carrie and a few other luminaries, like Gerwig and Larson, won't eat dairy.
Cloister the oysters, say "ta-ta" to the tartare, make sure there's no feta for Greta, or brie for Brie! Perfect.
Is that a fussy baby I hear? Here's a little trick I learned.
[clears throat.]
Bye [coos.]
[phone beeps.]
[groans.]
[Amanda's voices echoing.]
Kitada, Kitada, Kitada [phone ringing, beeps.]
Diane, hey! Look, now isn't really the best time.
I came up with a bunch more great baby names while I was interviewing this boring senator.
Huh? Okay, but Jacinda, like the New Zealand prime minister who had a baby while in office.
Or what about Ravital, which is Hebrew for an abundance of dew.
Is it weird I haven't picked a name yet? Ah! Don't worry about it.
My parents didn't name me until I was four and I turned out great, right? Right? Listen, I gotta go.
Bye! Wait! What about Lucretia? [sighs.]
So, you were saying your wife went missing in this wheat field? [groans angrily.]
Oh, there she is! [woman hums.]
Move the vase over there.
Those flowers are dead.
Princess Carolyn, the band changed their mind about the apples.
They'd prefer sweeter ones for this event.
But they're okay with Fiji if it's frigid.
Okay, I follow so far.
For this gala, Gala apples over Fuji for the Bee Gees I mean, Fugees.
But we have to keep their Fujis frigid.
Got it.
No, their Fijis frigid.
Right.
That's what I meant.
Also, it turns out Marian is pescatarian, and Meagan is no longer vegan, but she is refusing to sit next to Chrissy Teigen.
And now Carrie eats just dairy.
Okay.
Marian, pescatarian.
Meagan, not vegan, but does hate Teigen.
Carrie loves dairy.
Got it.
[phone beeps.]
Gala for the gala, but Fugees like Fiji and frigid Fuji Fiji! Fish! [giggles.]
Oh, you think that's funny? [giggles.]
[phone rings.]
[phone beeps.]
And how's my favorite client? It's me.
I stole Mr.
Peanutbutter's phone.
I had to Wait.
Is Mr.
Peanutbutter your favorite client? Let's circle back on that.
What's goin' on? Your "favorite client" just showed up at my rehab for the "Friends and Family Meeting.
" The what? Not important.
But can you please come collect your "favorite client"? Yeah.
Hang tight.
[phone beeps.]
[groans, sighs.]
Okay.
Thanks.
Fuji koojee koojee, Greta feta, Brie brie.
[phone rings.]
Oh, hi, Brie I-I mean, Flea.
[shouts.]
What did you do to my film? We had to make some edits.
You mixed all the flashbacks together with the present-day scenes, the relationships are incomprehensible, we don't even know how Birthday Dad dies! Audiences are sophisticated.
We don't need to spell everything out for them.
It's 42 minutes long and it ends in the middle of a sentence! Leaving room for a sequel! I ain't got time for this.
I'm prepping a sensitive coming-of-age movie about a young girl in hiding, built out of the reanimated corpses of other young girls in hiding.
In spite of everything, me still believe people good, fire bad! Not now, ChloÃ« Grace.
So, "Birthday Dad" needs another pass.
You can still No.
Deuces.
I'm outta here.
As the Nazi scientists learn in my new film that I'm just now realizing is in possibly poor taste, there are only so many times you can take something apart and put it back together.
[Flea's voice echoes.]
Put it back together, put it back together Gala for the gala.
Fuji So here I am, digging a hole Fiji Oh, excuse me.
I have to pick up my Peanutbutter at Pastiches and get back to Fiji for the Bee Gees I mean Fuji for the "Mujis.
" Your arm looks pretty ripped up.
Is that all from needles? Yeah, my baby's needles.
Uh, listen, we're about to go have some chamomile tea and do a little guided meditation.
Why don't you join us? Well, I guess a quick break couldn't hurt.
[camera shutter clicks.]
[sighs.]
Hey.
[Princess Carolyn groans.]
Hey.
[yawns.]
Hey, you okay? You've been asleep for a really long time.
Huh? What? [gasps.]
[groans.]
Why am I here? Mr.
Peanutbutter? Oh, yeah! Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Who's that dog? "Birthday Dad" is over.
Huh? No, I'm over! Over the moon about continuing to work on this project! Go home.
[Pickles.]
And I was like, "Ilana, you have to be my maid of honor.
" Um And then my other friend Ilana was like, "Were you talking to me?" Typical Other Ilana, always assuming she's the Ilana I'm talking about.
[sighs.]
Okay.
Hello, darling! [pants.]
He's home, he's home, he's home, he's home, he's home! Say hi to the Pickle Pack, Mister! [chuckles.]
Hello, internet! Keep up the good work with all those charming memes! I love the one where the boyfriend is looking at the other lady.
And his girlfriend turns to him with this expression of tremendous pain.
How could this man, who claims to love her, betray her so flagrantly? That is a very sad meme.
Uh okay.
Bye, Pickle Pack! [phone beeps.]
What is going on? What do you mean? You've been acting different.
I first noticed it the night of the "Philbert" premiere, when you came home late, smelling like Diane, and then after a while, things went back to normal.
But then you got real weird again right around that time BoJack went to rehab.
Right before you proposed that day, you also smelled like Diane.
[sniffs.]
Oh, my God.
I get what's happening.
Pickles You feel guilty.
You're right.
I feel so guilty because I chea Because your good friend's in rehab.
Chiefly feel guilty because my good friend's in rehab, like you said.
Why don't you go visit him, if this is the thing that's been weighing on you.
It is.
The one thing.
BoJack Horseman [gasps.]
and Mr.
Peanutbutter in the same room? Oh, God, no.
This can't be happening.
What is this? Hello! Are you here for the "Friends and Family Meeting"? You're the first friend that BoJack's invited.
I don't even remember getting invited.
I did not invite I'm proud of you, BoJack.
Hey, I'm Doctor Champ.
Mr.
Peanutbutter.
[BoJack groans.]
Hey! Your name's Mister? My name's Doctor! How about that! Wait, is Doctor Champ just your name? Are you not a doctor? Five-minute warning everyone.
Five minutes.
Come on, BoJack, let's get some good seats! [chuckles.]
We're sitting in a circle.
They're all good seats.
How can I make up for all the lies, the stealing, the cheating? She says we can make a fresh start, but is that even possible? Hmm [indistinct chattering.]
I'm sorry, can we go back to the cheating? Did you tell her about that? Oh, Mr.
Peanutbutter, we don't interrupt when others are sharing.
Just looking for a little context.
Why don't you go looking in your car? Maybe you left it there.
BoJack, don't interrupt Mr.
Peanutbutter, he's sharing.
No.
But he But, but, but.
Butts are for cigarettes.
Thank you, Doctor Champ.
As I was saying, I think Doug needs to be honest with his wife before they can move forward.
[all.]
Ah.
You're right.
I need to tell her.
But on the other hand, maybe that's just your guilt talking.
Isn't it sometimes better to let sleeping dogs lie? I-I assume your fiancÃ©e is a dog? She's my wife, and she's human.
Okay, so your fiancÃ©e.
Let's say her name is Pickles.
Wait, uh She doesn't know, and she's happy not knowing.
Wouldn't telling her now just cause additional pain? [all.]
Uh-huh.
So, it's better not to tell her? Oh, well, that's really convenient for you, Doug! No, I didn't Hey, everyone, look at "Doug" deciding that the best option just happens to be the one where he doesn't get in trouble! Mr.
Peanutbutter But that's just Doug all over, isn't it? Classic, stupid, selfish, inconsiderate Doug! [indistinct chattering.]
Wow.
Those are harsh words.
But I needed to hear them.
Thank you.
Uh [sighs.]
Look, I don't know what's going on with you, although I'm pretty sure either you or Doug cheated on Pickles.
But I understand that feeling of needing to bottle up your guilt, not burden other people with it.
Yeah? You think you're protecting them from your toxicity, you convince yourself that you're being selfless, but it comes out in other ways and it infects everything.
[sighs.]
I could use a drink.
Is there a bar in here? Mr.
Peanutbutter So, then I said, "No.
It's rehab.
" And then he left.
That was two days ago.
Two days ago? Oh, my God, the gala! Yeah, and you're probably worried about your baby, too, right? Oh, my God, my baby! [line ringing.]
Come on, Todd.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Hey! I was wondering if I'd hear from you Todd-Day.
Yes-Todd-Day, I thought, "Maybe I'll hear from her Todd-Morrow!" Is Untitled Princess Carolyn Project okay? She sure is.
Oh, thank God.
Wait, you're talking about Untitled Princess Carolyn Project, the baby, right? Who else would I be talking about? Well Mr.
Knickerbocker will see you now.
Great! [phone ringing.]
Oh, hold on one second.
[phone beeps.]
Hello? Todd, I have to go to a photo shoot.
I need you to take the baby for an hour or so.
Well, you know how much I love hanging out with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project, but I can't Todd-Day because of all these meetings I have.
[snores.]
But if my schedule weren't so busy, I'd say [pops.]
"Sure, I'd be happy to.
" Great.
I'll see you at VIM in 15 minutes.
Um okay? [phone beeps.]
I'll be right back.
[pants.]
Sorry about that.
[phone rings.]
Hello? Todd, change of plans.
Bring the baby over to me at SmashFox Studios.
Okay, he had to cancel another meeting but he will see you now.
I'll be right back.
[baby cries.]
I'm going to level with you, Todd.
You making me wait made me angry, and that made me respect you.
Sorry, things have just been a little hectic since I've been helping out with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"? I'm intrigued.
You think the project has legs? Yeah, she has legs.
I'm thrilled to meet you.
The whole town is buzzing about "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.
" Weird, but okay.
We need something big.
Is "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project" the kind of thing that makes a lot of noise? She sure does! I'm in.
Name your price.
Um Jonathan? We took a big swing with Dick Wolf's Milwaukee shows.
Turns out audiences are not interested in a whole night of Milwaukee, so now we've got some slots to fill.
Do you think "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project" could live for several seasons? I don't see how those things are related, but I certainly hope so! Well, how can I help? You wanna help? Let's start with a two-season pick up.
Yeah, sure, pick-up, drop-off, whatever works best for you.
That would be great.
Great! [baby giggles.]
Well, here she is.
What time do you want me to pick her up? Wait, it's a baby? And she has legs! [coos.]
I already canceled "Milwaukee Waste Management.
" I told the shareholders this was gonna save the network! We designed the poster! [coos.]
Todd, we need a show.
We can't air a baby! [blows raspberry.]
So, long story short, Pinky canceled the baby, but now we owe him a TV show.
Huh? So, the show is called "Birthday Dad.
" The pilot was directed by Flea Daniels, and the show will be run by Karen Kitada.
The creator of "Med School Nights"? And "Med School Nights: The New Class, Med School Nights Goes to Law School"? Uh This show's about a dad who died on his birthday, and every episode, his spirit visits a different intersectionally representative person on their birthday to help them work through their own issues.
But how are all these characters related? When does the show take place? How does Birthday Dad die? Those are mysteries we'll tease all season! Uh-huh.
"Birthday Dad," you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll Birthday Dad! What do you think? Yeah, like I said, we'll take anything.
[phone ringing, beeps.]
Yeah? [BoJack.]
Hey.
Um, so, I don't wanna waste any more of your time.
I just wanted to say that I know you're really busy and I'm sorry for making your life more difficult this week and also always.
Also, I know that my apologies are pretty much meaningless at this point, and I'm sorry for that, too.
Why didn't you tell me about the "Friends and Family Meetings"? I don't know.
You got so much goin' on, I didn't wanna bother you.
I would have come.
Okay.
Thank you.
[elevator dings.]
[pants.]
Did I miss it? Is the "Do It All Ball" all done? Yes.
We did it all.
Good of you to show up, by the way.
Oh, yeah? Well, it's good of you to, uh Shut up! [sighs.]
Are you okay? You're not your usual medium-clever self.
Can I ask you something? So, there's work, right? I mean, work makes sense to me.
And I'm good at it.
I don't feel that way about my baby.
I don't think I'm feeling what I'm supposed to feel.
What I thought I would feel.
I mean, I love her, of course I do.
Of course I love my daughter.
But [sighs.]
But I don't know if I love her.
I know I'm a terrible person for even thinking it, but what if it never happens? Do you love all your clients' projects? Of course.
No, you don't.
But you take care of them and you keep them alive because that's your job, right? Yeah.
So, now you've got a new job.
And it is a ruthless one, and I mean ruthless.
You don't have time to waste second-guessing how you feel about it.
You just have to do it the best that you can, and know that that's the best you can do.
You know, [scoffs.]
we have so much in common.
I don't know why we've spent so many years hating each other.
I never hated you.
Did you hate me? Uh no.
[cries.]
Hey.
[shushes.]
Hey.
Please.
Listen.
Did you get the Fijis for the Fugees? [giggling.]
Yeah.
Is that silly? The Fugees were egregious when they got interviewed by Regis.
[both giggling.]
Isn't that right Ruthie? [blows raspberry.]
[mellow music playing.]
The series is called "Crooshin' USA.
" [man.]
What does that mean? Crooshness is hard to define, but I also don't know it when I see it.
Oop.
Pardon my reach.
Well, I'm always trying to get more girls interested in agriculture.
You might say I've got my eyes on them.
Potato eyes, that is.
Guy? [Guy.]
Mm-hmm.
Hey, girls! It's Diane, outside Idaho's largest potato supplier, Starch Farms.
Hello! Let me get this straight.
Your farm harvests five types of potatoes, two types of onions, and is also a front for a local sex trafficking ring? [gasps.]
How'd you get started in sex trafficking? Uh [panting.]
I don't think I'm getting that microphone back.
This is the second straight year this Michigan resort's food has tested positive for avian botulism.
Wow, two years in a row.
It's like the Tom Hanks of poisoning people.
They said the jewelry is safe for humans now, but I've been wearing this for a week, and [groans.]
Can we get more B-roll so we have something to cut away to when I have to scratch my nose? I thought scratching your nose was your way of saying hello to me.
Don't you find it a little convenient that the mayor has yet to restore clean drinking water to this part of No, it's quite inconvenient.
You think this is convenient? The East Side is a lower-income area, ergo the residents are not huge campaign donors, ergo No, the mayor didn't target that neighborhood, he was just that stupid when it came to water filtration.
He was just stupid enough to think he wouldn't get caught, ergo Say "ergo" one more time.
Ergo.
Nah.
No, no, no, no.
[Diane giggles.]
This is Diane Nguyen This is Diane This is Di This is Diane Nguyen, and that's the Croosh! [Guy mumbles.]
Let me see.
Did you hear about Philip Morris Disney Fox AT&T AOL Time Warner PepsiCo Haliburton Skynet Toyota Trader Joe's? What about them? They got acquired by Whitewhale.
Oh, shit.
Well, how many companies are there now? Four? [gasps.]
What is it? I'm sorry, Diane.
Look, I asked for two beds, I swear.
Huh.
I mean, this is unprofessional.
One bed! What are we supposed to do with just one bed? Quite a pickle.
I should march right back down to that front desk and tell them [both moaning.]
Thank you [chuckles.]
for helping me with my one bed bit.
[both moan.]
It's a good bit.
[theme music playing.]
[BoJack's voice.]
Dear Diane, hello.
[Guy snores.]
This is a letter.
Rehab is making me write a letter to a friend because I guess letter writing is therapeutic? I hear it did wonders for the Zodiac killer.
Anyway, rehab's going fine.
A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga and I think next week we're doing a color war.
And it's good that I'm here, and it's good that I'm not drinking or taking pills, but I keep thinking about how this isn't real life.
It's summer camp.
Temporary.
Easy.
As nice as this is, I know that someday I'll have to go back to the real world.
Hey, Lady, listen, can you put him on the phone, please? I don't care if he doesn't wanna talk to me.
I'm his father.
No, Lady [Guy groans angrily.]
[BoJack's voice.]
Anyway, that's my letter.
I probably won't even send it, but if you're reading this, I guess I did? Your friend, BoJack.
P.
S.
Horseman.
I'm only in Chicago for a week.
I don't think it's selfish to wanna see my son.
Yeah, but you gotta give your ex notice.
Whose side are you on? Uh Hey, look out the window.
[Guy.]
Wow, there she is! The second windy, muddy, big-shoulders city by the lake.
Look! Willis Tower.
Oh, and look, the new Whitewhale building! You cannot be excited about a giant corporation like Whitewhale setting up shop in your hometown.
I'm just excited we got a new big building.
In your face, Dubai.
[chuckles.]
[man gasps and pants.]
Hmm Ah Not bad.
It's because the bread is made from lake water and lard.
[phone buzzes.]
From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.
Today, your phone is ringing.
Here's what you need to know about people who still use their phone to call people.
Hey, Stefani.
Hey, girl! No, no, it's Guy.
[Stefani.]
Hey, Guy! I got you on speaker.
Diane's eating the best sandwich of her life.
It's okay.
[Stefani exhales.]
Diane, I love that you still eat sandwiches.
Flaws like that are what make you relatable to regular women.
[gulps.]
What? Meanwhile, I am adoring your cross-country exposition of the ugly underbelly of American capitalism.
So croosh.
But I wonder if you could make room in the rotation for a few feel-good stories? Stefani, our videos are making a difference.
Yeah, a difference in how bummed I am.
There's gotta be some good news out there.
[sighs.]
We'll see what we can do! Why'd you say yes? We can do feel-good stories.
What about that girl who opened up a lemonade stand to pay for her dad's cancer treatment? How is that a feel-good story? "Hey, America! We're the only developed nation without subsidized healthcare, so this child joined the workforce in a desperate bid to keep her father alive!" Okay.
How 'bout this? Local cameraman has a pretty good thing going, where he gets to travel all over the country, and fool around in hotel rooms with his beautiful, smart, feisty producer and he's pretty sure this passionate, intelligent, warrior for truth likes it, too, so maybe these two knuckleheads should swallow their pride for a second and make some feel-good videos.
Hey, girls.
Hey, Diane.
Hey.
Tell me about the Every Animal Girl Company.
We are two best friends who got tired of seeing dolls promoting unrealistic beauty standards.
Take Ginny here.
Most giraffe dolls have necks one inch shorter by scale than the average girl giraffe.
Not our Ginny.
Her neck is long and proud, for all our necky gals out there.
As a necky gal, I love that.
And is it true that all your dolls are made out of recycled material? Uh No.
Yes! Sorry? Well, traditionally [overlapping dialogue.]
The first batch, um The important thing is we're two best friends.
Okay, what's going on? Uh [giggles nervously.]
Okay.
We are excited to announce that as of today, the Every Animal Girl Company has been purchased by Toys Galore, a subsidiary of Whitewhale Consolidated Interests.
Yay! Toys Galore! Uh Huh? "Yay" A small, independent start-up bought out by a huge conglomerate.
It must be so empowering to see your success grow.
What a happy story for two best friends.
Now, about the recycled materials? Well, it's unclear what role recycling will play in the future of this company.
Right now, we're mainly focused on empowering young girls, and closing the main Chicago factory so we can relocate overseas for cheaper labor.
Right before the holidays! [clears throat.]
Feel-good.
[strained.]
What an exciting, empowering time for you! I know.
You think you can edit that down into something feel-goody? For sure.
It'll have to go up late, though, because I'm having some friends over to watch the game tonight.
God, I'm freezing.
Aw.
So, you, uh You wanna watch the game with us? Are you asking me to meet your friends? No, I just figure, since you're staying with me anyway I would be delighted.
Wait, it's not the Chicago Baby Humans game, is it? It's just a mascot.
[reporter.]
And there goes Waa-Waa, the Baby Human, stumbling around like the furless featherless dolt he is.
What's he got there? Don't drink that poison, you crazy human! We don't drink poison.
Diane, he's not a literal human.
Waa-Waa is a tribute to your proud human heritage.
I'm very flattered.
Anyway, meet the gang.
Everyone, this is Diane.
My, um Ah You know, my The woman that I work with.
[all.]
Hi.
[man.]
'Sup, dude? Hmm You okay? Yeah.
Sorry, just I'll be right back.
[doorbell rings.]
[sighs.]
Diane, I'm really sorry, but It's fine.
I wasn't expecting, ya know, in front of your friends.
He just showed up.
We haven't put a label on us.
I'm not looking for The speech and debate tournament was canceled on account of cyberbullying.
Wait, what are you talking about? My son is here.
He surprised me.
Oh, shit.
I usually don't bring women around my kid unless it's serious.
I get it.
Do you mind staying at a hotel? Oh, yeah.
Totally.
He'll be gone first thing tomorrow.
What if he sees me go out? Is the coast clear? You should maybe go out the window.
[grunts.]
This makes sense.
But what about my stuff? I'll pack your bag and throw it out to you.
Okay, good.
Bye.
Thank you for inviting me to your party.
You have a lovely home.
[BoJack's voice.]
Dear Diane, hello.
I am writing you another letter.
Today sucks.
There's this new lady here, Beverly, and she took my snack kit.
And that is so classic Beverly.
Probably.
I just met her.
The whole point of the snack kits is they're communal, right? They're these bags full of snacks that we take on our morning hikes, and we put them together the night before, as like a team-building thing.
Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bag of candied nuts into a snack kit, something just for me.
And I marked my bag with a "B" so I'd know which one to grab in the morning.
"B" for "BoJack.
" [groans angrily.]
But then today, I see Beverly, who, again, just got here, waltzing around the house with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebody made a special kit just for me! B for Beverly! I must have a secret admirer!" Again, just got here! [shivering.]
The story of my life is that I never get anything nice.
You'd think that I'd learn to adjust my expectations by now.
But, no.
Once again, I was the idiot who got my hopes up about candied nuts and now I am disappointed with no one to blame but myself.
[sighs.]
Anyway, what's new with you? [scoffs.]
Just kidding, you can't say anything, this is a letter! Okay, talk soon.
BoJack.
[crickets chirping.]
[phone buzzes.]
From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.
Today, your Hello? [Stefani.]
Diane, your last video Okay, I know it wasn't as feel-good as maybe you wanted Are you kidding? I feel great! You made a big impression with the guys at Whitewhale.
Really? I'll say.
They bought Girl Croosh! What? Well, technically they bought Fuddruckers and merged it with Dow Chemical to create a new media venture called Spronk! [Diane.]
Hold on Spronk acquired Univision, which will incorporate Girl Croosh into the Gizmodo-branded mist of advertorial.
That's terrible! Not for me! I'm gonna be rich! You already are rich! Oh, yeah! [giggles.]
Oops.
Well, anyway, good luck with Spronk, which is currently rebranding as Content Spew.
So spew that content, girl! [giggles.]
Bye! Oh, "spronk" me.
[sputters.]
Pardon our dust while we finish construction.
Can I get you a Pepsi Cola? Or anything else from the vast Whitewhale agglomeration of fine beverages? [sputters.]
Uh, I think we're good.
Hmm.
[beep.]
I'm sorry about last night.
It's fine.
Let's just watch the movie.
Welcome! Here at Whitewhale Consolidated Interests, we do it all through the free-market magic of the Whitewhale Way! [both.]
That's right, Mr.
Whitewhale! Who? Why? Where? Whence forth are you two, and how did you manifest in my office? Be gone, ghastly ghouls! [giggles.]
We're no spooky specters! My name's Vert! Vertical Integration! And I'm Ollie, the Oligopoly.
You summoned us here to tell your new employees about the Whitewhale Way! Well, best be quick about it, you unholy apparitions.
The Whitewhale Way was developed by Ezekiel Whitewhale, who started small with a modest petroleum refinery he inherited from his father.
[Ollie.]
One day he looked around and said, "Wait one minute! While I'm refining this oil, someone else is getting rich drilling it, and another someone's sellin' it to the common commuter!" So, he bought his own rig and opened a chain of gas stations.
By controlling both the means of production and the delivery system, Ezekiel cornered the market, and choked out the competition until they had no choice but to sell to him, too! And that's vertical integration! [burps.]
[giggles.]
Pardon me.
F-f-f-f-fast forward to the 1980s, when Jeremiah took our company to the next level.
[Vert.]
He bought a telephone company, a sports team, and when he didn't like the way the newspapers were talking about him, he bought his own newspaper! [Ollie chomps.]
Well, I must have been a hungry whale because I just kept gobbling up companies.
Fast forward to today, and it looks like I gobbled up you! [chuckles.]
Are we supposed to be charmed by this? Welcome to the Whitewhale family.
Everywhere you are, that's where we'll be.
Here's a list of your new sister companies.
Please be mindful of them as you spew your content.
[sputters.]
So we can't make videos about any of these subsidiaries? Monsanto, JP Morgan Chase, Marie Osmond? Oh! There it is, the Every Animal Girl Company.
You don't really think Whitewhale bought Girl Croosh just to kill our video? And you couldn't just tell a feel-good story about two friends who started a business.
Maybe this is for the best.
You can get a new job in Chicago, spend more time with your kid.
Yeah, and you can go back to LA, where you won't have to borrow my coat all the time.
[giggles.]
Didn't you wanna write another book? I have this book of essays I've been brewing in my head.
It's called, "One Last Thing and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up About This Forever: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the War on Women: Arguments, Opinions, Reflections, Recollections, The Razor Tax" Is this still the title? I kind of got lost in the middle and couldn't find a way out.
No, no, it's good, I just think you want to save some of it for the inside of the book.
[sighs.]
I guess that's it for us, though, right? I guess so.
Unless it isn't it for us? What do you mean? What if we did one more video about anything we wanted and posted it on the website before they realize we still have all the passwords? We could do a story about Whitewhale.
Oh, yeah! Now, there's a feel-good story.
Me feeling good about takin' those assholes down! Diane, this is Isabel, star reporter at The Tribune.
She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.
Call me Isabel.
Okay.
All my days, the beast has haunted me.
The hunt consumes my every waking moment.
You might even say Whitewhale is my green light at the end of the dock.
What? That's a Gatsby reference.
Read a book.
Isabel, be nice.
I wish I had the energy, but my obsession has ruined me.
Destroyed my relationships, obliterated my career.
And for nothing.
I had one contact on the warehouse floor, Matt Minnowman.
Hmm.
Then he disappeared.
Maybe there's your story.
Not your story? Mm.
My editor thought I was getting "too invested" in the Whitewhale beat, so he moved me to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.
Now the search for the season's hot toy torments my waking days.
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners? The answer eludes me at every turn.
[Diane.]
I can't believe it.
We got a lead.
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place? Are you kidding? It's so cold.
How is it snowing in October? There are basically two seasons here: bitter winter, unbearable humidity.
You'll learn to love it.
[giggles.]
[Diane gasping.]
[both giggling.]
[BoJack's voice.]
Dear Diane, I'm sure you are dying to know how this Beverly secret admirer situation is going, so I'll cut right to the chase.
[Guy.]
Oh! I started writing "BH" on my snack kits to clear up any confusion about who the extra nuts are for.
But now Beverly thinks "BH" stands for "Beverly, here-ya-go.
" "Beverly here ya go"? Why would the "H" stand for [Guy and Diane moan.]
You know what? Doesn't matter.
The dumbest part is that Beverly doesn't even eat candied nuts.
[Diane moaning.]
She's allergic.
So she usually just ends up giving her nuts to me.
[Guy snores.]
Doctor Champ would probably say that means something.
That the universe has a way of looking out for us if we just stop fighting it, but I don't know.
Anyway, I guess it's working.
Hope things are working for you, too.
BoJack.
[keyboard clacking.]
Were you up all night? I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.
Turns out there was an "accident" at the warehouse.
What? He stayed late to finish some work.
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.
It's no big deal.
" Next morning, they found him dead.
Oh, shit.
This guy was trying to get the word out about working conditions, and then he died in the warehouse.
I got the names of some coworkers, let's get our hands on the security footage.
Did you know your cereal was made by Whitewhale? I threw it out to be safe.
Microchips Oh, my God, you're looking at me like I'm crazy.
You think I'm obsessed.
Am I totally scaring you off right now? No.
You're glowing.
Hmm.
[keyboard clacking.]
We were working 17-hour days.
We were spread thinner than a shitty New York slice of pizza and working harder than the '96 Bulls.
[Guy.]
Okay, so Matt's stationed here So, what, he walked to the other side of the room just to die? That's where he died, all right.
Management left his body out there on the floor.
Almost like it was a warning to the other workers.
Wow.
I just don't think you can attribute it to intentional cruelty.
It's callousness.
Can't it be both? Whitewhale's not evil.
They're just capitalists.
What's the difference? From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.
Today Hello? Mister Whitewhale would like to meet you at the Chicago Whitewhale building tomorrow at 2:00.
Bring your camera.
[sputters.]
Oh, shit.
If they know what we're doing, why would they wanna talk to us? I guess we'll find out.
I'm kind of weirdly excited.
Hey.
I got you something.
What? Shut up! Huh.
Ah.
You don't like it.
No, I love it.
It's just I won't get much use out of a coat like this in LA.
No.
It's for here.
Is this your way of asking me to move to Chicago? No.
[chuckles.]
Not everything is some kind of secret underhanded conspiracy.
Sometimes a coat's just a coat.
Okay.
But I also don't know why it's so obvious that you go back to LA.
I live there.
But there's nothing for you there.
Excuse me? I just don't understand why you're so into punishing yourself.
I am not And it's not just yourself, because every time you get cold, guess who has to give you his coat.
Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you? No.
[sighs.]
I just don't know why I should suffer because you have this ideological objection to feeling good.
Are you I would love to feel good.
What a luxury.
How nice for you that you can do that while the world burns around you.
This is not even about the world, this is about you and me.
"You and me"? What's "you and me"? Don't No, no, tell me, Guy, please, because I would love some clarification.
Am I your girlfriend? Am I the, um, "you know, woman that I work with"? Come on, Diane.
What is this? I Just take the coat.
I think I should go back to the hotel.
[sighs.]
[Diane shudders.]
[birds chirping.]
I didn't know if you'd come.
Well, we got a job to do, right? Could get chilly up there.
I don't know what kind of video you're putting together, but I wanted to let you know I don't mind.
You're not gonna stop us.
I don't want to stop you, I just said that.
See, when you put out stories about us being "evil" or "callous" or whoever the bad guy in Harry Potter is, people think our business is uncompromised by morality and our stock goes up.
So, it doesn't bother your shareholders that one of your employees died in a work-related accident? What accident? Matt Minnowman's body was found in your warehouse.
Oh, him, sure! But that was no accident.
I killed him.
What? I murdered him! Like "murdered" murdered him? Well, I didn't murder of crows him.
He took too many bathroom breaks and encouraged the other employees to take bathroom breaks as well.
And you're not worried it's going to get out that you killed an employee? Like in the video we're shooting right now? Didn't you hear? Congress just passed a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.
No, they didn't Oh, my God, they did! What? Hold on.
Just because it passed the House doesn't mean the Senate will Really, Diane? Okay, but the president could still veto Really, Diane? All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.
Okay, I get it.
Look, don't take it so hard.
If you wanna do something about it, just make a billion dollars and murder me! [both cackle.]
Barbara, let's make sure they get a nice Whitewhale Company gift bag on their way out.
[sputters.]
Well, we can still post the video.
Why? Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.
It's been real.
Yeah.
It's been real.
I'm not gonna beg you to stay, if that's what you're waiting for.
I'm not waiting for anything.
I'm not that guy who says, "Diane, please don't go, I'm in love with you.
Stay here in Chicago and write your book of essays and come with me to baseball games.
They've got a pretty good theater scene here and a big shiny bean and you could [sighs.]
You could be so happy in your warm winter coat.
" I don't need you to say I'm not gonna be that guy, all right? But if you wanted to stay, I could make things so good for you, Diane.
Listen No, no, I get it.
No, listen.
Guy.
I feel so shitty all the time.
I feel like the whole world is pushing in on me, except for when I'm with you.
You have been such a good thing for me.
But I can't be with you if you're the only good thing in my life.
It's too much pressure.
I'm sorry.
Diane! Don't get on that train! [scoffs.]
Guy, I just told you I know, but you're going to the airport.
That train's going to Cottage Grove, you're gonna get screwed! Oh, no.
[BoJack's voice.]
Dear Diane, it was Beverly's last day yesterday.
Everyone is real excited for her, but she spent the whole day sulking because she never found out who her secret admirer was.
Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying, so finally I just say, "It was me! I'm in love with you!" And she goes, "Oh.
I was hoping it was Mario.
" And then she starts crying.
And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go, you made Beverly cry on her last day".
So, the thing I keep thinking about is was it worth it for Beverly to be happy for a little bit, even though it ended up sad? Or would it have been better if the whole thing never happened? Every time someone leaves rehab it makes you think about your own progress.
Some days it feels like you're not progressing at all, other days you think, "Well, maybe a little.
" The main thing I think about is how stupid I am that I didn't do this sooner.
I wasted so many years being miserable because I assumed that was the only way to be.
But I don't wanna do that anymore.
Also, am I crazy or have I gotten really good at writing letters? [sighs.]
This is BoJack, by the way.
[phone beeps.]
[line ringing.]
Hey.
Hey.
I was thinking about these grilled cheese sandwiches I used to make, back when I first moved to LA.
What? I was dirt-broke and I had no friends and no job, and I got obsessed with perfecting the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.
Makes sense.
Partly because it was cheap, but also because while I was doing it, I wasn't thinking about how depressing my life was.
Okay.
So, on the plane I was thinking, I should make another grilled cheese sandwich because I haven't in a long time, but I love them and they always make me feel better about things.
Look, Diane, I gotta And the thing about making your own grilled cheese sandwich is you can do it anywhere.
You know? Yeah? Yeah.
So, I guess that's another good thing.
Okay, guys, that is my cat eye tutorial.
It probably works better if you're not a dog, but anyways, like and subscribe.
Oh, and RIP Nelson Mandela and Paul Walker.
[icon pops.]
Love you, sassy boys! I just don't feel like doing a makeup tutorial today.
[whirring.]
Dad! I'm shooting a video! [Franco.]
Demi! I really thought me and Buzzy were built to last, like Brad and Angelina, or Gwyneth and Coldplay Man, or America and its current love affair with Rebel Wilson.
[sighs.]
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking about my personal life.
I just feel so alone.
[icon pops.]
Aw! Thank you.
Hey, Pickle Pack! Gettin' ready for another job interview.
I think I'm just gonna lie about having experience.
Right? I got the job! I'm a systems analyst? I got fired my first day as a systems analyst, but then I got a job as an air traffic controller! I got fired my first day as an air traffic controller.
But then I got a job as a waitress! So, I've been seeing someone.
[icon pops.]
He's a yellow lab, and he's so handsome and friendly.
[barks and licks.]
Mister asked me to move in with him! [icons pop.]
Hi, Mister! Oh, are you taking a video? [laughs.]
Thank you, queefburglar69, for that lovely cartoon heart! Get a load of this cool house, Pickle Pack! Lights, off.
Lights, on! [giggles.]
Thank you, Robot House! Check this out.
The Thunder Room.
A place to wait out thunderstorms and Fourth of July celebrations! Thunder door, close! [automated voice.]
Closing.
[clunks.]
Thunder Room secure.
Cute! He got down on one knee and everything! He was so nervous before he asked! Of course I said yes! [icons pop.]
I think Mister is still in shock! Engaged! That's what we are now! Ring filter! So, I guess I liked the play.
I was just surprised at how different it was from the movie.
I kept waiting for the baseball part.
And so many dysfunctional relationships! All the cheating and lying! [sighs.]
I'm sure glad we're not like that, right, Mister? Um, Pickles, would you mind turning off the livestream? There's something I need to discuss with you.
Privately.
Ooh, I hope it's something good! [beeps.]
[sobbing.]
The wedding is off! [crying.]

[exhales.]
Hi, I'm here to see BoJack.
You're [hisses.]
too late.
What? He's [hisses.]
gone No! to a party for the night.
Here's the address.
Sorry for all the wincing.
I put too many jalapeÃ±os on my [hisses.]
sandwich.
A party? With alcohol? No, a lame party, without alcohol.
Uh Don't worry.
We sent him with a trained sober companion.
He'll keep him out of trouble.
This is Eduardo.
He's here to keep me out of trouble.
[chuckles.]
Say, aren't you one of those fainting goats? [laughs.]
Only if I panic.
So, what makes you panic? Nothing.
The whole point is he doesn't panic.
Sober companion.
You know what makes me panic? Most of the time I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy, but sometimes I like to dwell on the fact that there will always be invisible walls between myself and those who claim to know me.
[chuckles.]
That sure is nerve-racking, but the only thing that makes me panic is the thought that I might someday drink again.
A toast to that never happening! [whimpers and thuds.]
Very helpful.
Thank you, Eduardo.
Oh, I'm just Greg, a guy Mr.
Peanutbutter met at a gas station once.
I honestly don't even know why I got invited to this party.
[Ruthie crying.]
You know, I got a few TV ideas myself.
[chuckles.]
Franco, nobody wants to hear your time-travelling orthodontist pitch! Demi, you are lighting a long fuse on a short stick of dynamite.
Oh, whoop.
And a big one at that.
[inhales, exhales.]
Diane! Didn't think I'd see you here! [screams.]
Could you go tell BoJack to come out so I can talk to him? What? I don't have time for your classic Diane wackiness.
We gotta get these to the balloon room! [coos.]
[screams.]
Hey.
Hey, look who's back in town! [groans.]
Wow! Baby! Cute! [giggling.]
She's crawling all over the place.
I wasn't gonna bring her out, but another nanny quit on me.
Carlotta quit, huh? I assume she resigned in disgrace for not making good airplane noises when she feeds Ruthie? No, she said she felt she was being watched all day.
Impossible! I'm there around the clock, observing her every move.
If she was being watched, I'd know! Uh-huh.
Uh, where do these balloons go? Hello, Pickles' best friend Ilana.
Pickles' other friend Ilana.
Didn't think I'd see you here.
And then of course, there's always the looming fear my spleen could up and re-twist itself.
How are we back in a conversation? It's like I'm trying to canoe out to sea but the current keeps washing me back to the same shallow backwater.
Hey, there you are.
Thank God, I'm so glad you're here.
Never leave my side.
I have to tell you Okay, everybody get to your places! What's happening? Mr.
Peanutbutter's and Pickles' surprise wedding! Surprise wedding? The wedding planning was stressing Mr.
Peanutbutter out, and Pickles loves big romantic surprises.
And I'm not doing much except for sitting at home watching Princess Carolyn's terrible nannies, so naturally I thought, "Ooh! Surprise wedding!" Where are they now? I got them two tickets to Angels in the Outfield.
The movie? The play.
It's like six hours long.
Do you mean Angels in America? Whatever it is, after that feel-good comedy, they'll be in a great mood for a wedding! Wow.
Okay Look, I cannot be here.
Just I'm moving.
Great, your apartment's a dump.
Where are you moving to? Uh, not Echo Park.
I'll never see you.
Chicago.
Chicago? "Chicago" Chicago? Ooh, they just pulled into the driveway! Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Why Chicago? Everybody hide and stay quiet.
[slapping and groaning.]
Remember, as soon as the lights go on, just jump up and yell, "Surprise!" Lights, off! [lights beep.]
Um, Pickles? Would you mind turning off the livestream? There's something I need to discuss with you.
Privately.
Ooh, I hope it's something good! It's not.
Lights Wait! Before Robot House assaults us with the harsh unforgiving glare of our energy-efficient bulbs, I need to tell you this.
But it's so dark in here.
What I'm about to confess is so shameful, I can only admit it in the cover of shadow.
Don't be silly.
Lights, on! I cheated on you! [man.]
Surp! [man shushes.]
Did someone just say something? Don't change the subject! [voice breaking.]
You cheated on me? I am so sorry.
How could you do this? It was the worst mistake of my life! And I once played Twister with Bryan Singer at Kevin Spacey's party for Andy Dick's early parole.
I've been in the Thunder Room every night for months trying to swallow my shame.
But I can't.
And I've apparently been so racked with guilt I left the door open.
Thunder door, close.
[automated voice.]
Closing.
[clunks.]
Thunder Room secure.
[muffled voice.]
Help! Please! Just because you feel guilty, that doesn't make it okay.
Are you the time I went to see Lady Gaga in concert and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"? Because I am hurt, and I am confused, and I am angry, and nobody told me there was going to be an encore, so I just went home and [groans.]
Why am I even talking to you? I need my best friend.
I'm calling Ilana! [gasps.]
But, honestly, can Ilana even relate to me anymore? Since she got that new Sunday-to-Thursday job she's turned into a real See-You-Next-Friday.
I never thought I'd say this, but sometimes I feel like I prefer my other friend Ilana.
Sometimes it's just easier to talk to a person who has nothing else going on.
What? Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.
I'm a Gemini.
No! Think of my family! They need me to be strong right now.
Poor Captain Peanutbutter.
He recently confided to me he feels trapped in a loveless marriage with Mrs.
Captain Peanutbutter.
[laughs awkwardly.]
Well, can you blame her? Excuse me? Every time I get trapped in a conversation with Captain, I think, "If I was married to this guy, I would gnaw my own hand off just to get the ring off my body.
" At least no one in my family has anger issues.
My father has come so far with his anger management classes! I'm sorry, but your father is a hot head with a little pug complex.
Everyone makes excuses [snarling.]
for his outbursts.
"I don't know what's gotten into Franco.
He's not usually like that.
" [shushes.]
Trust me.
He's like that.
How dare you.
And the way your mother provokes him! I think they get off on it, and they're making us unwilling participants in their kinky foreplay.
Ew! Those are my parents! And don't even get me started on Greg.
[shushes.]
That guy that I met once at that gas station! Why are you bringing him up? I don't know, but he sucks, too! Oh.
There, I got it off my chest.
I know who I need right now.
No, Pickles.
Please don't TweedFeed this.
I understand your Pickle Pack is part of how you process pain.
Wrong, Mister Mister.
The Pack isn't part of anything.
They are everything.
When I stabbed myself in the eye with a boba straw, they all sent me photos of themselves wearing eyepatches.
And when my Grandma Piccolino died, stickyvicki was the first person to say "LMAO.
Sorry for your loss.

And they have never strayed.

My God, thank you, not even.
[knocks.]
Hi.
I know you are quite upset, but Are you not listening? I told you to leave me alone.
Right, but Oh! You want a makeup tutorial? Here's a makeup tutorial: We are never making up! Wha Door, slam! Okay.
Here's how to look like a crying, pugly freak! [Pickles.]
So, you're gonna want a mascara that really runs So, why Chicago? What? What's the draw? Is it the rampant gun violence? Or do you just like seeing improv actors who aren't good enough for LA? Or is there a guy? Uh What's his name, your suitor? Your gentleman caller? Guy.
Fine.
What's your guy's name? No.
Guy is the name of the guy I'm not moving to Chicago for.
What's the name of the guy you are moving to Chicago for? I think we're done here.
[cooing.]
Ruthie.
This is all your fault.
If you hadn't creeped out every nanny I hire I wouldn't have to monitor them so closely if you hadn't hired a bunch of quacks! Ooh! Duck! [grunts.]
[Mr.
Peanutbutter whimpering.]
What's with all this mid-century furniture so close to the ground? No one had to hide in the '50s? Close to the ground, that's it! We've gotta think like a baby! I'm a baby.
I don't have a job.
I love being wrapped up in soft, red hoodies.
And when I'm feeling low, I like to get high.
[gasps.]
Ruthie's a climber! [panting.]
Just as I suspected.
[licks.]
Fresh drool.
It's Ruthie.
Todd! [coos.]
[BoJack grunts.]
[sighs.]
So, I obviously can't marry him, right? What do you guys think I should do? Hey.
Give me that.
[text pops.]
"You should make Mr.
Peanutbutter take you to the park, far away from this mouse.
" What mouse? [groans.]
[text pops.]
Great idea! Door, open! [both gasp.]
Hey, Mister! Take me to the park! [giggling.]
[Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Can do! I'll be right down! Okay, Pickle Pack, let's pick out an outfit.
What says, "I am going to survive this because I am strong, but you should still feel very bad"? Uh Go, baby! Go to mama! Oh.
[giggles.]
But what if we go for a walk and he says all the right things and I forgive him? I can't make it so easy for him, can I? Oh, my God.
That is an even better idea, MarciFartz.
Hey, Mister! Cancel the park and come here.
What? Stay out of my shit, MarciFartz! [Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
On my way, darling! Kitty up.
[grunts.]
[Ruthie blows.]
[Princess Carolyn sighs.]
Bring me my favorite drink.
Exactly the way I like it.
Then we'll talk.
Of course, right away! [BoJack grunts.]
[groans.]
Of course he'll make my drink perfect.
Because he's perfect! I mean, look at him! And and Look at him! [BoJack groaning.]
Um Oh! And him, as portrayed in this boardwalk caricature drawing! I didn't know he liked tennis and skateboarding.
What else has he been hiding from me? [sighs.]
I mean, is it me? Was I not good enough? [text popping.]
Yeah, I'm not the problem! In fact, why am I even in his house? [pops.]
I need to pack! [groans.]
I'm going to a fancy-ass hotel.
And [gasps.]
I'm gonna try to get my room comped in exchange for social media promotion! And then they'll say no.
And then I'll pay for the room and drag them online.
Hate to leave you hanging.
[grunts.]
[coos.]
Yeah.
Wait a minute! Why should I leave? He's the one who cheated! [exhales.]
[grunting.]
He can live in the dog park for all I care! [text popping.]

Impossible.

It's not because of me that you're moving to Chicago? No.
I need to go.
[Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Pickles? Precious? Possible point of complexity Son of a bitch.
[grunting.]
I know your favorite drink is boba, but just the other day, you said, "Whipped cream is the best thing in the world" immediately followed by, and this is a direct quote, "So, keep it as far away from me as possible!" I just wanted to circle back.
[music playing over earbuds.]
Yeah.
Don't get me wrong, I love the challenge of trying to square two irreconcilable positions.

I'll be right back with your drink prepared exactly the way you want it! [Princess Carolyn grunts.]
Here.
You know how in AA they give you chips? But no salsa? Using that.
But they're a big deal, the chips.
Sure, they brainwash you into thinking they're more important than they are, but when I got my two-month chip I thought, "I wish Diane could see this.
" I see it.
It's amazing.
It would not be improved by salsa.
[Pickles.]
Door, open! [both gasp, grunting.]
No! No! [BoJack scoffs.]
[Pickles humming.]
Hmm.
Sunshine, I have your boba.
[Pickles.]
No whipped cream, I hope.
Of course not.
You always know how I like it.
Is there any chance we could talk IRL? Intimately, rigorously, lengthily? [inhales, exhales.]
You know, what's funny is now I actually want the whipped cream.
Well, good news, because, uh Hmm I don't want to be mad at you.
That's great! No, it's not I know I caused you pain, but we can get through this.
I still wanna marry you.
Do you still want to marry me? Promise me you'll never lie to me again? I promise.
Then I guess we could put it behind us if it just happened the one time.
It did! One time! One unit of cheating.
Comprised of two separate instances.
What? But the spirit of it was once.
Well, at least you told me right away.
It happened a few months ago.
What? But I'm being honest with you now! Okay.
At least it wasn't with someone I know.
It was Diane.
Diane, the nice lady from the chew toy store? Diane, my ex-wife? That's so much worse! You are a bad dog! No.
No.
No! [shrieks.]
[shattering.]
[Mr.
Peanutbutter groans.]
[Pickles crying.]
[crying continues.]
Come on, Eduardo.
Hold it together.
You're not just a fainting goat.
You're a trained sober companion.
Just do what the sign says.
No! [thuds.]
[music playing over earbuds.]
[sighs.]
[whirring.]
Vacuum, stop.
[automated voice.]
Stopping.
Coin sorter, sort.
[tinkling.]
Oh, Coin Sorter, I'd love to toss my problems in a tray and say, "Here, sort these out.
" I know it doesn't work that way, but if only this smart house could give some advice to this stupid dog.
[BoJack imitates robot.]
Go to her.
Coin Sorter? Go to Pickles.
Go now.
I don't know, Coin Sorter.
I've already screwed everything up so bad.
I should sit here and wait for her to come to me.
No.
You go to her.
Leave this room.
Okay.
[imitates robot.]
But don't talk so much! What? It is I, the robot, uh, thermostat.
Thermostat, I should have known.
I can always count on you to cool things down when they get too heated.
You were saying? Sometimes you try to fix problems or make them go away, which comes off as dismissive.
If you want to solve this, listen.
Really hear her.
Beep-boop.
Seventy-two degrees.
Okay.
[both sigh, grunt.]
[normal voice.]
Is this mess why you're moving to Chicago? [normal voice.]
I told you, I'm moving for me.
I get it.
Are you gonna be okay? Yeah.
I mean I don't know.
You seem okay.
But the reason I had to tell you I was leaving, the reason I came to my ex-husband's house, was because I need to know that you're gonna be okay.
I need to hear you say it.
I can't leave if I don't know you're going to be okay, BoJack.
I'll be okay.
Promise? Because if something happens, and I'm in Chicago That's not a friendship, that's a hostage situation.
Go to Chicago.
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
[Todd gasps.]
[balloons popping.]
Hey! Ruthie? Ruthie! [groans.]
[both grunting.]
[balloons popping.]
There you are! [giggling.]
Let's get you away from these delightful choking hazards! You know, Todd, you have a knack for this.
Would you wanna be her nanny? I do know her routine and all of her favorite foods and how to do funny voices for bedtime stories, unlike Carlotta who does voices like Cameron Diaz "did a voice" for the Shrek movies.
[giggles.]
So, that's a yes then? [music playing over earbuds.]
[sighs.]
I don't want to be mad at you.
It sucks that I have to be mad at you.
This should be the happiest time of my life, but now because you did something stupid, I have to feel bad.
That's not fair.
And I still love you and [sighs.]
I still wanna marry you.
But you can't do things that hurt me like that.
It's not okay.
And if we just go back to the way things were before and pretend nothing happened, I'm gonna feel stupid.
We can't just go back.
How can we make this right? Don't just stand there! I'm talking to you.
I'm sorry.
I want us to stay together.
I want you to trust me.
I wanna make us even somehow.
Even? The only logical way to be even would be if I got to sleep with somebody else.
Okay.
If that's what needs to happen.
Really? Yeah, we just have to think who Buzzy.
My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.
Very quick with that name, but okay.
Fine.
No, you don't even know him.
Knowing is what hurts the most.
What if I sleep with Buzzy and Tyler from Soul Cycle? Two people? Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.
If we put our heads together, I know we'll find the perfect guy for you to cheat on me with that makes it totally even, so things can go back to normal and we can get married.
Thank you.
[doorbell rings.]
Hey, guys.
Diane? I'm just here to randomly apologize for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.
It was a big mistake and it was my fault and it will never happen again.
Also, I think I left my wallet here when I came to your party a year and a half ago.
If you find it, probably under the bed in the master suite, could you mail it to me? I live in Chicago now.
Thanks.
This is Eduardo.
Don't mind him.
He's just keeping me sober.
Found the baby, had a blast, gotta go.
And here's your boba.
Thank you.
Odd.
[phone buzzing.]
Oh, my parents are calling.
Fun! Put 'em on speaker!
In my line of work, I meet a lot of big names.
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s.
Nick Nolte.
Mickey Rourke.
Literally, here we are in the '90s, and these are the guys we think are sexy, right? And my daughter couldn't care less.
But when I told her I was meeting BoJack Horseman Do me a favor.
Make her day.
[sighs.]
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.
Angela Diaz, head of the network, calls me, working schmuck, Danny Bananas, and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin', and I want you to run 'Horsin' Around.
'" So, here's me, thinking, "What an opportunity to write for the most finely-calibrated ensemble cast on television!" It's like a bowling alley with you people.
Setting up pins and knocking them down.
I should be so lucky.
Uh.
I know it's no secret that you and Herb had some friction, and he left the show under not-great circumstances.
Now I'm coming at this from a place of: This is your house, and I'm a guest, all right? The magic of "Horsin' Around" is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.
I know why people buy the Big Mac.
I'm not here to change the recipe.
You're the special sauce, BoJack.
Me? I just wanna be the bun.
And not even the top or the bottom bun.
I'm fine being the middle bun.
You already told me this story.
I did? Yeah.
Danny.
Sharona.
The buns.
We've been over it.
Well, did I tell you about Gina? Yes.
And Sarah Lynn? Multiple times.
Yes.
What about the time I sneezed on Marisa? You've told me everything.
You told me about that dream where you go to a dinner party.
I even went down that strange detour with you about the three-nippled woman in the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.
Who was she? I think we're done here.
What do you mean, done? Well, you've been here six months.
It's time to go home.
[theme music playing.]
[Shannon.]
Oh, sorry.
Uh, not this way.
My boss is gonna kill me if I don't deliver these flowers to his mistress.
Well, we're filming an episode of "Birthday Dad," and my boss is gonna kill me if I let anyone through.
Great, when they discover my remains scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park, my loved ones will take solace knowing I died so they could shoot an episode of "Birthday Dad.
" I'm sorry.
It's a really good show! I know I couldn't always be there for you, birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.
I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.
You really don't get it, do you? This is the real world, okay? And I'm a career gal.
I don't have time for birthdays.
But what about the birthday spirit? Everyone knows there's no such thing.
This is the real world.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to drink my coffee.
Cut.
Let's move on.
[bell rings.]
Great take, Melodie.
Chills.
Are we Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline, and all of the greatest Motown singles collected on one [groans.]
[chuckles.]
"Big Chills.
" Hot herbal tea? Yes, that would be Ooh! Ha! Oops.
[chuckles.]
Got me again, Audrey.
Donna, we're gonna need another scarf.
Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you? No, what they're turned onto is hating me on account of I cheated on Pickles.
Ever since the story went viral, the public has really mashed the thumbs down on old Peanurino.
Especially young women.
Oh, no! "Especially Young Women" is one of our show's eight target demos.
We gotta juice your Q! Right now, the only juice I'm interested in is Pickles' juice and making things kosher between us, which is a task I relish.
So, you wanna have sex with me? Yes.
And your fiancÃ© is gonna be in there watching, or Oh, no.
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
This is not a fetish-based cuckolding scenario.
He had sex with his ex, so to level the playing field now, we have to boink, so Mister and I can be even and everything can go back to normal.
You understand? Not really, but I get to have sex with you? Yeah.
Correct.
Then, cool.
I'm in.
But what about your reputation? I'm not too worried about it.
I feel like people generally want to like me.
And if I just don't do anything, eventually, the universe will realign and the public will go back to loving me again.
[grunts.]
Ugh.
Mm, thanks for making breakfast.
Thanks for calling it breakfast.
Not everyone appreciates the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.
Are you starting your memoir today? That was the plan.
But I got these dishes now.
That'll take all morning.
And once the morning's over, basically the whole day is shot, you know? Better to start clean tomorrow.
Look, I know it's hard to start a new thing, but the hardest part is starting.
You're right.
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman who pays child support, so I'd encourage you to get an advance.
Hmm.
[indistinct chattering.]
Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone? I just wanted to raise a non-alcoholic toast to Denise.
[laughter.]
Ha-ha! [man.]
Ow! My gluten intolerance! We've all been through so much together, and it's never easy to say goodbye.
Remember when Doug left? [all.]
Hmm? Or Jameson? [all muttering.]
Or sweet, sweet Bongo? Sorry, who are we talking about? To Denise! [all.]
Denise! [man laughs.]
I didn't realize we're the last of our original group.
God, we had some good times, huh? I mean, no, mostly.
Yeah.
But you're ready, right? Ready or not, here I go.
Yeah, you're ready.
Have you given any thought to what we discussed yesterday? About you transitioning to a version of yourself that is no longer here? I don't know.
Things are kinda working for me.
Staying out of trouble, got the fancy room, finally perfected my egg-white omelet order.
The secret is egg yellows.
I might do another six weeks.
[chuckles.]
You've already re-upped three times.
This place is for people in crisis.
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.
Right, Karmen? I-If I say yes, I can see my baby? Karmen, no.
You sold your baby to a den of leeches to pay for crack.
The leeches have your baby now.
Oh, yeah.
Ah.
Classic Karm.
It's natural to be hesitant.
When I first checked out of rehab, I was terrified.
I knew a single drop of alcohol would send me down a ruinous path.
But I found my way.
Found your way back to rehab.
Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.
"Our?" A lot of people leave this place, and I think, "They're not gonna make it.
" Like Denise, for example.
But you? You've done the work, and you're ready.
You're a special case, BoJack.
I am? Of course you are.
Huh.
[Sharona.]
Oh, boy, did he do a number on you.
He was actually very nice.
You know, I want things to be easy on set.
And I think Danny represents a fresh start.
Is that why you got Herb fired? Hey, I'm not the one who I can't do your hair if you're gonna move your head so much.
There was nothing I could do about Herb.
If it wasn't for me, they would've canceled the whole show.
And then where would you go? Who's gonna hire a hair and makeup lady with shaky hands? My hands only shake when I don't drink.
Be sure to put that on your rÃ©sumÃ©.
You're just bitter because I'm the only person who can drink as much as you do.
[giggles.]
Ruthie! Here comes the airplane [tires screech.]
[car crashes.]
Oh, a kerfuffle! [people clamoring.]
Hey! What's going on out there? An ice cream truck crashed into the root beer factory! Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.
Five people are dead! Oh, no! And there's worse to come, unless somebody can slurp up all that ice cream! Oh, I'd love to help slurp, but I just started a new nannying job.
I don't care! Hmm Wow, BoJack leaving rehab.
Truly the end of an era.
[crying.]
Sobby Bobby.
Gonna miss your excessive crying.
Can't believe it.
Last time I'm gonna stop at this vending machine.
What do you say, B-7? One more hike down Funyun Canyon? [inhales.]
Whew.
Oh, wow.
Hello, the public.
Didn't think I'd have to address this so quickly, but I am not ashamed.
Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab Uh, keep it moving.
We wanna get a clean shot for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.
Joey Pogo? Yeah, he's checking in today.
We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.
Fancy room? He's gettin' the fancy room.
It's time to go home.
What? Ready or not.
I got the fancy room.
He's gettin' the fancy room.
You're a special case, BoJack.
Stay cool, man.
Have a good summer.
What does it all mean? Sounds like they're kicking you out to make room for Joey Pogo.
Huh? Sounds like they're kicking you out to make room for Joey Pogo.
Oh, my God.
I think they're kicking me out to make room for Joey Pogo.
I just feel like if I knew the source of my addiction, everything else would just click together.
Playtime's over.
BoJack! What the hell? This is my time.
Shut up, Brad.
The source of your addiction is wanting to impress your old babysitter who stole beer from your parents' fridge.
She's dead.
You're free.
No, that's not Oh.
Oh I thought you were checking out.
Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you? Yes.
I've been very clear on that matter.
Well, check this out.
BoHo go bye BoHo go bye-bye for What is he doing? I think he's trying to get out a zinger.
We better let him finish.
You have to imagine that I just said it.
It's only funny if it feels extemporaneous.
Don't waste your breath setting it up, just say the thing.
Why don't you start over? Check this out.
BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo Pogo? That's a no-go, bro.
Worth it.
[car horns blaring.]
I'm sorry.
Please, go around.
I worked on it all night.
The thing that's gonna save your career.
Ha! What is it? It's a meme! For posting online! Teacher gave you too much homework? "Sad Dog!" Your favorite sports outfit lost the match? "Sad Dog!" People are gonna love it.
And that love will transfer to you.
But I'm not a sad dog.
I'm a happy dog.
Everyone knows that.
So, it needs some massaging.
[phone rings.]
Hold on, I gotta take this.
Conversation over? "Sad Dog!" See how easy it is? [phone beeps.]
Pickles! How was your date with Carl? I don't know, Mister.
The sex was good, like, really good, but I didn't feel an emotional connection.
Don't beat yourself up about that.
You just met the guy.
But part of the betrayal of you sleeping with Diane is the fact that you share an intimate history.
If we're really trying to even things out, I don't think Carl counts.
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have to keep having sex with people until you find someone with whom you have an emotional connection.
[sighs.]
That might be a lot of guys, but if that's what it's gonna take to save our marriage, I will keep riding the express train to bone-town until that happens.
That's my girl.
Oh! Thank you.
[phone ringing.]
[beeps.]
Hello? Hey, it's Diane.
Oh, yes, I thought I heard retired dads in the distance, praising the '95 Chicago Bulls.
Maybe you could give me some advice.
I'm writing a new book, but I shouldn't even get started until I sell it to a publisher, right? What is it? I'm still in the loose idea phase.
Half essay, half memoir.
The working title is, "One Last Thing, and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up About This Forever: A Definitive Retrospective of the Choices We Make, People We Hurt, The Places We Go: Part One.
" How could it be part one if it's definitive? I'm getting another call.
[phone beeps.]
Hello? Hi, while you were blabbering on, I had our lit assistant take care of everything.
A navel-gazey book of observations.
Sounds fun.
No, I I sold it.
You have six months.
Enjoy the process.
Oh.
[groans.]
Wha What happened? You're packing your things backwards.
What happened is you said I was special.
You gave a whole spiel, just trying to get rid of me to make room for a high-profile new client.
I thought we'd made strides on your jealousy issues.
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel.
" I'm not jealous! And I've definitely seen it written out as "spiel.
" I think it's spelled "spiel," but it's pronounced "shpeel.
" Not now, Joey Pogo.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting? I was told I was in the fancy room? We're moving some things around.
Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow? Oh, tomorrow is jammed.
I'm shootin' a video for my new single, "Lace Up," which is spon-con for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.
Could we just do it now, real quick? You wanna do rehab real quick? Life is precious.
God is religious, or merely the idea of human connection.
Don't do drugs.
Say you're sorry.
Powerful stuff.
Feels like I just got a new lease on life.
Stay cool, bro.
Don't ever change.
That's the problem.
When you say it in here, it all sounds easy.
But I know that out there, it's hard and confusing.
And it's just I-I don't But you're not alone.
You have a wonderful support system.
Think of all your amazing friends, just waiting to love you as you love them.
[groaning.]
[vibrates, beeps.]
Todd's phone.
What if Todd was one of us? Um, okay.
Is Todd there? Please hold for the next available Todd.
[beeps.]
Okay.
["Ode to Joy" tune.]
Todd, Todd, Todd Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd, To-Todd Ugh! Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd Todd, Todd, Todd Hey, buddy.
Hey, listen, I'm You're probably wondering about Georgette, the newest member of Team Chavez.
Nope.
Since I've started taking care of Ruthie full-time, that hasn't given me a lot of time for regular Todd business, and stuff's been falling through the cracks.
So, you hired an assistant? Well, yes, but assistants are like Deadpool movies.
I couldn't just stop at one, even though I probably should have.
Now I have 12.
You hired 12 assistants? To assist you? Yep, I've got Bella trying out new goofy dances, Pedro's monitoring all the Five Guys franchises to make sure each one has the right number of guys, and Silvia's in charge of checking [clock ringing.]
All About That Ace every 15 minutes.
What is "All About That Ace?" My asexual dating app.
I think I might be the only one on it.
[Ruthie giggles.]
But another ace could join any day now.
And when that happens, two of a kind.
Well, I guess that makes about as much sense as the rest of it.
Listen, um, I might be getting out of rehab soon BoJack, that's fantastic! and I wanted to talk to you because I, uh [sighs.]
can't do this by myself.
Hey, I got you, buddy.
You just wait one jiffy.
[sighs.]
Hi.
Ah! I'm Casey, the assistant.
Todd hired me to be your friend.
Okay, that's, uh, you know I think I'm good.
Thank you.
He said I would be perfect for you because you could be mean to me and you wouldn't feel bad because you're paying me.
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be very discreet, whatever you need.
Marc Cherry used to dress me in the outfit Natalie Wood drowned in and scream at me for hours on end.
It was very therapeutic for him, and I didn't mind because he wasn't screaming at me, he was screaming at death.
Stars really are just like us, huh? Do you mind if I have a sip? Don't drink that! Right, of course.
I must earn hydration.
So sorry.
No, it's just That's vodka.
You think it's a good idea to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab? Because it is if you think it is.
It's not for drinking.
I just, I I don't know why I keep it.
As a reminder, I guess.
Of what? [BoJack.]
Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn! What? Are you almost done? I need Sharona to work that magic on her mane man.
Yeah, I'll get to you in a minute.
Cool your jets.
Why can't you do this in Sarah Lynn's dressing room? My stepdad's in there, and he's being weird.
Why is that my problem? We appreciate your hospitality.
Hey, BoJack, what do you think of the new guy? Danny? Yeah, he's okay.
Right? I miss Herb.
We all do, sweetie.
Herb.
Danny.
What difference does it make? We got a job to do, right? I'm just saying I miss him.
And I'm just saying it's not my fault he got fired.
I dunno why you're complaining to me.
I'm sorry.
Nobody said it was your fault.
I actually think Danny represents an opportunity.
For a new beginning.
You don't think it feels weird to do the show without Herb? If Herb really cared about the show, maybe he shouldn't have What? Been gay? No, that's not Obviously I put my ass on the line for you people.
Ugh.
BoJack.
Do you know how lucky we are to have this? Herb was gonna throw that all away.
I made the tough choice.
What did you do? I I don't know.
BoJack, she's ten! Yeah, which is basically an adult in Hollywood years.
I'm trying to make this situation work.
Enjoy my dressing room.
[sighs.]
Hey, I know you feel shitty, but don't take it out on a little girl.
[BoJack.]
I don't feel shitty, I feel great! Okay.
You know why this is here, Casey? It's because I think I'm special and the rules don't apply to me.
And I keep thinking that over and over again.
Well, you are special.
No, shut up.
[gasps.]
That's the problem.
I'm an asshole.
All your bosses are assholes.
And people like you indulge us.
And you soothe our egos, and you let us abuse you.
You're right, I'm terrible.
No, God damn it.
That's not my point.
Have some respect for yourself.
Okay, sorry.
I'm just happy to be a part of things.
Yeah, and that's how they get you.
[sighs.]
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Can you run downstairs and grab me some Funyuns? Mm No.
What do you mean, no? Huh.
I don't know.
I'm not going to do that.
Uh, what's happening? There's an "I" in assistants.
And this time, the "I" is us.
I like your energy, but what? And lo and behold, my sandwich has onions [phone beeps.]
when I specifically meant to tell you I didn't want onions.
Where are you going? So, this lawyer's got attitude.
[phone buzzes.]
And that attitude? Autism.
I don't understand, why is this person moving now? Wait! What's goin' on? The Hollywoo Assistants are unionizing.
This is a walk-out.
No! I've grown too dependent on you! I can't perform basic Todd functions anymore! I'm like a toddler, but a Todd version.
A Toddler! I know you got a job to do, but is there any way [phone beeps.]
Joey Pogo could get through? Just got out of rehab, I'm trying to get home.
Knock yourself out.
All right! Don't die on me, Ileanna.
Not on your birthday, of all days! Year after year, the only thing I wished for was a dad.
[sobs.]
And now you're here, and it's like [coughs.]
paging Doctor Birthday! But if you just told me your wish, that means it won't come true! You really don't get it, do you? It already has.
[gasps.]
I love you, Birthday Eric.
No.
Birthday Dad.
[groans.]
[crying.]
[director.]
And cut.
[bell rings.]
Wow, Melodie.
Are you Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Lady Ga Drop dead.
Star is Born.
[car honking.]
Huh? [gasps, grunts.]
Whoa! Ah! Buddy, what the hell are you doing? Get out of the way! Uh I saw the whole thing.
Mr.
Peanutbutter said, "I'm a sad dog," and jumped right in front of the car.
I think he's a really sad dog, you guys.
You know, like the meme.
[all gasping.]
Oh, my God, I had no idea.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, life is precious.
That's something you hear a lot in rehab.
Hey, why'd you try to kill yourself, you stupid idiot? Um I'm no psychiatrist, but it's probably because he's such a sad dog! [gasps.]
Mr.
Peanutbutter, we didn't realize you have a mental illness.
Thank you for getting the word out about depression.
You are truly a hero for destigmatizing this all-too-common affliction.
Yes, a hero! And to see more of this hero in action, tune in to "Birthday Dad" this spring on MBN! Uh-huh.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I think I sing for everyone when I say Don't hurt yourself, we love you [all cheering.]
Oh, so I guess this all worked out.
Huh? Oh.
Depressingly, that is.
[chuckles.]
[truck beeping.]
I saw your new assistant leave.
Why aren't you packed? I can't.
Please don't make me.
You don't know what I'm like out there.
Let's find out.
Hey, that's I won't coddle this anymore.
You're scared? Good.
Go to AA meetings.
Go to a psychiatrist.
But what pisses me off is when you take a bed that someone else could be using to get better.
Isn't it possible I'm one of those people that would benefit from staying here indefinitely? No.
You're not that special.
And you don't belong here anymore.
Pack your things.
[huffs.]
[inhales.]
Don't belong here, huh? [sniffs.]
[spits, gags.]
God, what am I doing? [grunts.]
[whistles tune.]
No! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[panting.]
[Bobby crying.]
Nobody drink any water! [gulping.]
[belches.]
Ooh.
[gasps.]
[door opens, closes.]
Wow, look at you go.
You can't look at it yet! Okay, okay! Sorry.
I was just kind of in it, you know? Yeah? It's going good? Yeah, you were right.
Once I got started, it was easy.
So much of my career has been writing for and about other people, and how terrible everything is.
It's actually really refreshing to just focus on myself, you know? Well, I don't want to interrupt your flow.
Please, write on.
[Doctor Champ.]
Oh, this is a fine how do you do.
Brad was like, "It's difficult to have a hot name, but not be that hot.
" Can you believe that? He's extremely attractive, no? I don't And honestly, is Brad a hot name? Brad Pitt, yes.
Ugh.
But like, name one other handsome Brad.
Bradley Cooper.
Damn it! Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
That was vodka you drank, not water.
Uh, duh! Jesus.
I'm drunk! Shh! Shut up.
If anyone hears you, there's gonna be I forgot how fun this is.
Just settle down, okay? Ah! You're gonna spend the night here and sober up.
Oh, so it's easy to be sober all the sudden.
[slurring.]
Look who thinks it's easy sober, hmm? Shh! Doctor Champ! It's so easy.
Everything, very easy.
[snores.]
[sighs.]
[elevator dings.]
[laughter.]
[grunting.]
Hey, Horse.
Bad news about the Manzanita lawsuit.
You think he'll settle? Settle? Manzanita? I'd say that's about as likely as my daughter Sabrina skipping school and sneaking into the office with me in my work luggage! [audience laughter.]
Uh Uh [director.]
Cut! [bells rings.]
Listen, you're doing great.
Slight change of plans, though.
Sarah Lynn had to go home early.
So, we need to change the episode to being about you not bringing Sabrina to the office.
Is she okay? Uh, only reason I'm telling you this is you're my main guy here, and I know you want what's best for everyone.
Of course.
Sarah Lynn got her hands on some alcohol.
Oh, my God.
Her mother is apoplectic.
She wants to sue.
I think it's just big talk, but someone needs to be held accountable.
And as the guys in charge here, we're responsible for figuring out who that's gonna be.
What are you I need you to be straight with me.
That wasn't your alcohol, right? Oh, I don't It wasn't, right? Because if it was, we're all in real trouble.
You get what I'm saying.
Y-Yeah.
So, you don't know where she got the alcohol from? Yeah.
I have no idea.
Okay.
But someone's gotta answer for this.
Well, don't look at me.
Hmm What? Nothing.
Just a little uneven, is all.
Oh.
I'm screwed.
I'm so screwed.
It's gonna be okay.
No! I'm drunk.
Not okay.
You can't let anyone know about this.
Shush! Yeah.
Shh.
You gotta stay with me until I sober up.
I can't be alone here like this.
It's okay, I'm here.
Yeah, be here.
You need to stay here, BoJack.
Please.
Stay.
and they even let the birthday boy pilot the airplane! There were no survivors.
In other news, the newly formed Hollywoo "Guild of Assistants" is meeting with industry power brokers today to negotiate terms for a standard agreement.
I'm optimistic about the coming talks and confident we can avoid a strike.
Our demands are reasonable, and our services are crucial to this industry.
All right, you little pishers, let's wrap this up quick so you can all go back to getting me wrong coffees.
What do you want? We have one request.
To not be treated like garbage.
It appears we are at an impasse.
[people clamoring.]
Where's my dry cleaning? Where's my car? I don't know any of my passwords! What's my mother's maiden name? I'm going into labor! You need to call my doula! Will somebody please make me a reservation at Little Dom's? [car alarm blaring.]
[theme song playing.]
[birds chirping.]
[groans.]
Oh, no.
Did I really drink last night? Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
I [stutters.]
Did anyone see me? You were in here all night.
Nobody can know about this.
There are 20 struggling addicts in this building who are counting on me.
[stammers.]
Of course.
I'm gonna go home, take a shower.
This never happened.
Agreed.
But how do I get out of here without anyone seeing me? [sighs.]
Whoa! Okay, okay, easy.
This requires a surprising amount of upper-body strength.
Stop swinging.
Just slide down.
Am I being inconspicuous? Yes.
Plus or minus the yelling.
I'm just gonna let go.
Don't [both scream.]
[BoJack groans.]
Thank you, BoJack, for being there to catch me.
Up! [engine starts.]
Ew.
"I looked in that case first chance I got and there was that note still tied there.
That line hadn't touched water in its life.
" "Doesn't mean nothin', Alma.
" "Don't try and fool me no more, Ennis.
I know what it means.
Jack Twist, Jack nasty!" [knocking on door.]
The sock puppet players tribute to Ang Lee will continue after this.
Oh.
Hello, Jorge.
I have some news.
It's about your mother.
Oh, is the news that you're marrying her, inserting yourself into our family and ruining my life? Because I already heard that news like 25 years ago, Jorge.
I didn't come to your home to fight.
Then joke's on you because you didn't come to my home at all.
I just sleep on the couch [Jorge sighs.]
since you and Mom gave me the boot.
That was ten years ago.
Which, by the way, is the only thing you ever gave me.
I gave you my name, and you have clearly wasted it.
Do you know what the Chavez name stands for? Yes, Jorge.
Chavez! C for cerebral! H for high-minded! A for analytical! V for veracious! E for efficacious! And Z for zealously practical.
Feels like a cheat on the Z.
Todd, your mother needs your help.
Well, then instead of sending her husband, she should have asked me herself, if it's so important to her.
She's in a coma.
A rudeness coma? No, a regular coma.
Oh, my God! Why didn't you open with that? Please.
Your mother needs a kidney.
I put her on the donor waiting list, but if you're a match Oh.
I'm sorry.
Of course I would give Mom my kidney.
Then there's no time to waste "Would" give her my kidney.
"Would.
" You need to work on your listening skills.
I sold my extra kidney just last week.
Why? I wanted to buy these sock puppets.
You sold your kidney for [groans.]
I'm sorry I came.
If you'd like to visit your mother Wait.
What if instead of visiting my mother, we got my kidney back? Come on, Ruthie! Field trip to the organ market! [Ruthie coos.]
[groans.]
[wind howling.]
[dial tone blaring.]
[thunder rumbles.]
Princess Carolyn, this is a catastrophe.
You know it.
This strike has shut down the whole city! Assistants want respect? If we respect them, how are we supposed to work through our rage issues? On our spouses and children? That doesn't seem fair.
There's gotta be a better way! Uh, maybe we could circumvent giving the assistants what they want by giving them what they think they want.
You know, like how we satiate TV creators by giving them little vanity cards at the end of episodes, then sell the shows to streaming networks that auto-skip the end credits so no one even sees the vanity cards! Yeah, yeah, that's good.
But what do assistants want? iTunes gift cards? Amazon gift cards? I honestly can't think of another thing an assistant would want.
When I was an assistant, the only thing I wanted was not to be an assistant anymore.
[gasps.]
Princess Carolyn, I'll say to you what I said to David Levy when we were developing The Addams Family and brainstorming ancillary characters, like cousins and whatnot: That's It! [man.]
Hey! Sad dog! Ha-ha! You know it! Wow.
Mr.
Peanutbutter and Joey Pogo in the same room? What is this? Two days ago when I almost hit you with my car? [chuckles.]
No! That was outside! Listen, I've been trying to get in touch with you.
I got a call from this mental health advocacy group.
Those guys are jizzin' their pants over your heroic admission of your struggle with depression, and they wanna help you share your story with the world.
The world, huh? I wanted to set up a meeting, but my assistant went on strike, and phones, for me, are, like, what? Even if you had your assistant, it wouldn't do any good.
My reps' assistants are all on strike, too.
Oh, bummer.
Guess there's no way to get in touch then.
Too bad.
I'd love to get together.
Goodbye, fancy room.
Goodbye, chair.
Goodbye, Stinky Susan.
Huh? [sniffs.]
Where to? Um Home, I I guess.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! Stop the car.
Let me out here.
Wow, already stopping for a drink? Thank you, your commentary is very helpful.
Five stars, though, right? [groans.]
[slurps.]
[inhales, exhales.]
[sighs.]
Doctor Champ, what are you doing? Okay.
This mood about "never have another drop of alcohol again?" Are we sure about this? Okay, Doctor Champ, clearly, you I'm sitting here, like, whatever happened to moderation, buddy? So, you're telling me the guiding philosophy of the six months of rehab I just paid for is complete bullshit? Hey, man, it works for you, it works for you.
As for me? Uh, check, please! No, that's a figure of speech.
I don't want the check.
Please replenish me with another mar-gar.
["Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" plays.]
[bell ringing.]
Howdy, howdy! Welcome to Mike and Morgan's House of Organs! We handle all your matters, from keyboards to bladders.
Mike, give it a rest.
What's with all the boxes? We're going out of business.
Oh, no! I told you we should just stick to the pianos.
You wanted to expand into body parts.
You printed the sign that said, "For all your organ needs.
" I was just trying to keep us honest.
Judging from the foolishness of your business plan, I assume you don't keep records, but we're trying to track down my son's kidney.
Oh Sorry, all our kidneys went to Chicago.
Jeremiah Whitewhale bought us out.
[gasps.]
[organ plays.]
Of Whitewhale Industries? Why? He's stockpiling organs because he's a rich old guy who wants to live forever.
[organ plays.]
Oh, no! Well, this was a pointless excursion.
I'm heading back to the hospital.
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
No.
It's my fault for expecting anything different.
[door opens, closes.]
[groans.]
Can we offer you anything on your way out? You want a Wurlitzer or a spleen or an industrial-sized tub of general anesthesia? Yeah, give me the anesthesia.
[Diane.]
You could sneak in during the party as long as nobody's estranged husband who's a cop is visiting.
Holiday party, huh? What? Where am I? You're in Chicago! Hi, I'm Diane.
This is Guy.
How you doin'? Oh! Are you ready for introductions or are you still processing the whole being kidnapped across state lines? I'm sorry, what? We're breaking into the Whitewhale building.
Why? To get back my kidney and save Mom and prove to you that I'm not just a wacky screw-up who engages primarily in goofy whimsical mess-arounds.
How did you get me on the plane? We did a Weekend at Bernie's.
[groans.]
As I was saying, tonight's the Whitewhale employee holiday party.
Security will be tight, but you can use my employee ID to get in, because I'm technically still on the payroll.
Wait, you didn't quit? We haven't worked there in months.
Nobody's noticed! They keep sending me checks.
Cashing them is my way of very gradually taking down the man from the inside.
Hey.
C can we sidebar for a minute? Is this really the best use of your time? You've been beating yourself up about how slowly the book's going.
So But the book is about me and my life, so by living my life, I am in fact working on the book.
You don't have to write this book if you don't want to.
Of course I want to.
Okay.
I'm just saying, since you started, you've been pretty down.
Not yourself.
Diane Actually, pretty down is myself.
Can we talk about this later? We're being rude.
Why don't you offer them one of your fancy beers? So, all we need to do is get into the party, figure out where the kidneys are, find my kidney, and sneak out, all without drawing attention to ourselves.
And be careful, because if Jeremiah Whitewhale catches you, he can legally murder you.
Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout? The barley was from Portland, Maine, but the brewery is in Portland, Oregon! This plan is ludicrous.
Hey, maybe instead of criticizing everything like you've done my entire life, you can get on board? It's gonna work out.
Things don't just work out, Todd! Of course they do! I don't know why you're so negative! Do you want to help Mom, or do you wanna just go back to the hospital and wait? [sighs.]
Okay.
I'm in.
[thunder rumbling.]
I don't feel comfortable negotiating without my fellow assistants present.
Yeah.
This is not about that.
Good, because our demands haven't changed.
Casey, it's been so thrilling to see you grow into your role as strike captain.
[gasps.]
You know, there's an opening at my company for a development exec.
I don't suppose you'd be interested? Oh! Uh I'd have to think about it.
I've never rea You'd get overpaid to read scripts, company credit card, and a parking spot in the good garage.
Um Plus, your own assistant.
An assistant? [thunder rumbling.]
That is, of course, if the strike ends.
[giggles.]
Well, that's a very generous offer, but I'd have to talk it over with my colleagues.
Why? Those are assistants.
You're not one of them anymore.
You're one of us.
It's a two-year contract.
Sign right there and your troubles are over.
[breathes heavily, exhales.]
[thunder strikes.]
[groans, shrieks.]
[both cackling.]
[Ruthie giggles.]
What's so funny? I was just remembering a funny joke, unrelated to this.
Can you tell me what it is? You wouldn't get it.
It's about Zsa Zsa Gabor, and it's no longer appropriate in today's climate.
You've made the right decision.
You're gonna love the new job.
Welcome to the team, Stacey.
It's Case [both.]
Hmm Hey! [grunts.]
Sign here to run development for Saoirse Ronan's production company, Saoirse and Rescue.
[Turteltaub.]
Mm-hmm.
I can't be an assistant anymore! Shirley MacLaine threw a cactus at my head because I set a meeting with the wrong Steve McQueen! How was I supposed to know she meant the dead one? [cries.]
Shh.
It's okay.
Just sign here and orchestrate your own great escape.
[Princess Carolyn chuckles.]
[Turteltaub.]
Ooh.
[car horns honking.]
Okay, I'm going in.
Todd, promise me you'll be perspicacious in there.
Perspicacious? I don't know the meaning of the word.
[sighs.]
You're Diane? Yes! Nguyen? That is correct! I find that hard to believe.
Wow, that's racist.
People don't always look like their last names.
For example, I'm white, and my last name is Chavez.
I thought your last name was Nguyen.
Oh! Uh, yeah, it is! Todd Nguyen.
Not Diane Nguyen? Oh, yeah! Diane Nguyen.
That's me, all right, or my name isn't Todd Chavez.
Well, that was a bust.
Okay, this time, you're Diane and I'll be Jorge.
Todd, get in the trash can.
I know I'm a disappointment to you, but I do not live in a trash can, Jorge, and I haven't for several years now! Hey! [both grunting.]
[speaking in Spanish.]
Uh What? Sorry, I Oh.
No EspaÃ±ol? [speaking in Spanish.]
Uh go ahead.
[indistinct chatter.]
Wow, that was amazing! No.
That was logical and straightforward.
Another club soda, please.
[Doctor Champ.]
Nerd! Doctor Champ, what is your plan? Just gotta drink enough to be steady.
Then, you take me back to Pastiches and keep me out of trouble.
That way, you don't have to go home and I can be a good therapy horse.
All my clients get sober, I am a winner, put my picture on a magazine.
[slurps.]
Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.
You don't care about me! You're scared of this guy.
You can't help anybody else unless you're honest with yourself.
Know what I mean? No.
I never know what you mean.
In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scared if you'd given me real therapy over the last six months instead of just plying me with folksy aphorisms.
I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse, a subtle but legally important distinction.
Besides, you wouldn't accept real therapy from me.
Oh, and why's that? Gee, I don't know, maybe because I'm a horse, so I remind you of your father, so you simultaneously resent me and crave my approval, an approval which, ironically, if granted Yeah, I would dismiss immediately and then use as an excuse to resent you even more, what's your point? My point is, you're stunted from having healthy relationships with horses, idiot! Oh, really? Well, if that were true, I would have almost no other horses in my life.
Right, it's almost as if all your friends and loved ones are humans or dogs or cats But then how do you explain the one horse I do care about, my half-sister Hollyhock, who is also a reminder of my father? If your theory were true, wouldn't I keep her at arms' length, desperate for her to love me but unwilling to be vulnerable enough to allow her to hurt me? You blockhead, she's not your father! Hollyhock reminds you of the horse you hate the most.
Yourself! Okay, you got me! My parents gave me an internalized self-hatred of horses.
So, my horse body is a prison that I can never escape.
This manifests in rotten behavior because I subconsciously believe I deserve to be punished, but being famous, I'm never punished, so I act out even more.
And since this pattern is so woven into my identity, it is unfathomable to me that it can ever be curbed, so instead, I drink! Uh Check, please! So, the only way I can progress is to return to my life as a sober man and finally hold myself accountable for my actions, past and future.
Oh, my God, is this what therapy is? Why do you keep bringing me checks? [glasses clanking.]
Uh Doctor Champ? [elevator dings.]
Wow.
Sorry, folks! [both gasp.]
This floor's off-limits.
Oh, but Oh, thank God you're here! I saw someone at the buffet putting ketchup on a hot dog.
What? Not in my town! [keys jangling.]
[elevator dings.]
Wow, you are really good at this.
Let's go.
[gasps.]
Ooh, wow.
Hmm.
Oh, look.
People who selected kidneys might also enjoy small intestines.
Just the kidney.
We don't need to be up-sold on other innards.
Yes, sir.
[beeps.]
Thank you for [clears throat.]
this.
Uh.
Once your mother is okay, we will never bother you again.
I know that's what you want.
Why would I want that? You never understood me.
I raised you as my own flesh.
I was tough on you because I expected big things from you.
You weren't tough.
You were mean.
Because the world is mean! Not my world! I wanted so much for you, Todd.
I wanted to push you to be your best self.
I see now that I failed you.
But you didn't fail me because I am not a failure.
Look [sighs.]
Okay, Todd.
Why do you need to be proud of me on your terms? Why can't you see I'm living a good life? I have friends.
I have a job You sleep on the couch and you play with puppets all day.
I'm happy, Jorge.
What more do you want from me? I want to know that you're okay! Then why haven't you called in ten years? You don't think I wanted to? I'm not the one who What? [Jorge exhales.]
She loves you, your mother.
But she's very proud.
If you called her, she would talk to you.
Well, she can't talk now because she's in a coma, right? [sighs.]
Yeah.
What are they talking about? Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
[keys beeping.]
[groans.]
Chavezes! You got company! Get out of there now! Do you read me? [Diane on radio.]
Hello? Hello? Diane? Why is there a walkie-talkie in our kitchen? God damn it! [man.]
Uh Excuse me? This garage is for shopping center customers only.
[groans.]
Okay, fine, I'll buy a pretzel.
Or you could just leave.
No, now I want the pretzel.
[Guy.]
Hey, Diane, get me a pretzel, too, please.
Love you, okay? [Jorge gasps.]
Someone's coming.
We have to go.
I'm not going until I get my kidney.
Todd, this is serious.
Yes, I understand.
You are very serious.
You read serious books and listen to Sirius XM.
We have to go right now.
Hey! Why do you always fight me? Why do you always try to make me leave places? [man.]
Hey! [both gasp.]
Stay right where you are! Whoa! [exhales.]
[grumbles.]
Um [sighs.]
[groans.]
Uh, I'm sure the other assistants will be here any minute.
Traffic's real bad because of the rain.
No one else is coming, Stuart.
Uh because of the rain? They got promoted.
Your ranks are divided.
Your leadership has abandoned you.
Face it, the strike is over.
Whoa.
Okay.
We've drawn up a new collective agreement.
You get none of the things you asked for and you start work again Monday.
Sounds fair.
If I sign this, does that mean I get a promotion, too? Sure, Stuart.
Someday.
[gasps.]
[Marv.]
Princess Carolyn, I'd love to give you a raise, but you're thinking like an assistant.
Any day now, you're gonna get promoted to agent and sign a brand-new contract, so why are you concerning yourself with these assistantly trifles? You really think I have what it takes to be an agent? Someday, sure! But for now, you're my assistant, and since you've got a similar build to the angry lady I fell on at the post office, I need you to try on these apology bikinis and report back where they pinch.
[groans.]
You got it, boss.
[gasps.]
Oh.
[Stuart.]
Um Stuart, don't sign that! I just remembered there's a typo on page 12! Instead of "billable hours," I wrote, "Billy Bob showers!" Ooh, that's not gonna fly, P.
C.
That guy hasn't showered since Bad Santa.
Man Who Wasn't There? More like "Man Who Doesn't Wash There.
" Sling Blade? More like "Please Bathe!" Monster's Ball? More like "Monster Balls.
" Great actor, though.
Let me fix up a new version and you can come back and sign it tomorrow.
I'll walk you to your car.
Well, this is my car.
Really? No.
I don't own a car.
[scoffs.]
So why did we walk three blocks in the rain? I panicked! I've never been in charge of where to go before! You're clearly out of your depth in these negotiations.
Take this number.
Wow.
This a lot of money, Princess Carolyn.
That's not an offer, it's a phone number! Oh Can you drive me home? [sighs.]
Officer, I Sir, did this man attack you? What? No.
You can tell me if he attacked you.
Hey! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Look, this is all a misunderstanding.
I'm just trying to take this kidney back to my mom.
Whitewhale's got like a hundred of these.
He won't even miss this one.
Well, aren't you a little scamp.
[both laugh.]
Oh, stop! What? Armageddon? More like "Arma-gettin' Away From This Stinky Guy!" What the ? Hey, who's in my chair? Mr.
Turteltaub, I thought our meeting was at 9 a.
m.
It appears to be 9:03.
[sighs.]
Hello.
If you're serious about negotiating, it's imprudent to send the message you don't respect our time.
To start these negotiations on the right foot, I suggest we adjourn for the day and start in earnest tomorrow.
On schedule? Um Okay? Fabulous.
Princess Carolyn.
Judah.
What the shell was that? Let the negotiations begin.
[clears throat.]
Todd, I, uh owe you an apology.
Oh? [inhales, exhales.]
I know I was hard on you when you were growing up, but I was trying to protect you.
Nothing came easy for me.
It took hard work, focus, discipline to get me where I am today.
Things didn't just work out.
But I should have realized: you're white.
I forgive you.
She's awake.
Do you wanna come say hello? I'm sure she would love to see you.
Well, she has my number.
That's cold, Todd.
What do you expect? I'm a Chavez, right? Hmm [groans.]
Huh? Where am I? You're at Partridges, the rehab clinic founded by Danny Bonaduce.
What about Pastiches? I told them I was checking you in here.
Why would you do that? Those people need me to be an example of success.
You can't help anybody else unless you're honest with yourself.
A wise man told me that.
Who? What wise man? You did.
I was being poetic and you ruined it.
Well, don't listen to me.
I'm a drunk! Yeah.
But the first step is admitting it.
You've destroyed me.
I can never go back to Pastiches now.
My husband will leave me.
I promised him I would never drink again after what happened to our daughter.
Uh What happened to your daughter? You know nothing of my life and you think you know what's best for me? The only reason I got drunk in the first place is because of your contraband vodka! Well, yes, technically, that's true.
Of course you did this to me.
Because I cared about you.
And you ruin people who care about you.
[exhales.]
Well, best of luck.
I want you to remember this, BoJack.
I want you to remember what you did to me.
I remember everything.
I'm sober now.
[melancholic music playing.]
[grunts.]
[inhales, grunts.]
[keys jangling.]
[sighs.]
I'm not kidding.
The pills.
Now! I told you, I'm on a system now.
I'm not doing drugs.
I'm not like you.
I don't fetishize my own sadness.
No, my hands are so slippery.
Damn it, Todd.
Clean up your shit.
You know I had sex with Emily.
Turns out there's a brand of heroin called BoJack.
Please don't make me go back to LA.
You can count on me, Herb.
[Todd.]
You are all the things that are wrong with you.
[Diane.]
You haven't changed.
[BoJack.]
Yes, you are the last person to get that.
I'm not gonna change.
[groans.]
[sighs.]
Goddamn [theme music playing.]
[BoJack sighs.]
Sharona? [Sharona.]
Ow! You're hurting me.
Let me go! [grunting.]
Sarah Lynn got into vodka.
Oh, my God, is she okay? Danny knows she got it from you.
It was yours.
Mine, yours.
What difference does it make who brought this particular vodka? If I take the fall for this, this whole show is over.
And that means everything I did was for nothing.
What you did? To Herb, I mean.
What I did to save the show, do you understand? All that's pointless if it goes away now.
So, what am I supposed to do? I have friends on Coach who owe me a favor.
It could be a fresh start for you.
There's no such thing as a fresh start.
It's an easy job.
Craig T.
Nelson's balder by the day.
What if I say n no? Nobody is asking you, Sharona.
BoJack Horseman, would you like to share? I [stammers.]
I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.
This is anonymous.
BoJack Horseman? Who's that? [sighs.]
Um, yeah.
Um I'm BoJack and, uh God, this feels so dumb.
And I'm an alcoholic.
[all.]
Hi, BoJack! Look, I can't go to the Galapagos.
Guy, you have to.
This is an important job.
[laughs.]
It's the National Geographic Swimsuit Edition.
They want me shooting behind-the-scenes video of turtles in bikinis.
Seems unimportant in light of what you've been dealing with.
What I'm dealing with? Your psychiatrist said you're depressed.
Okay, yeah, I've been a little depressed.
But I'm not like depressed.
I don't have depression.
You're smoking three packs a day, you've been wearing the same pajama bottoms for weeks This is all part of my writing process.
My best stuff comes out when I hate myself.
[chuckles.]
What stuff? No stuff is coming out.
[scoffs.]
I'd feel better if you just tried the medication your doctor prescribed.
Well, I'd feel worse.
They put me on Prozac in college and I was so calm and boring, I didn't even wanna LiveJournal.
And then Dawson's Creek got bad because there was no one to speak truth to power.
Dawson's Creek did not get bad.
You just started taking antidepressants, which you should also do now.
It sucks.
It made me break out.
I gained weight.
What if you leave and come back to this person you don't even recognize? I don't even recognize you now.
You're making this a bigger thing than it is.
I'll be fine.
Don't fall for one of those models.
I'm a one-woman man.
If that woman happens to be a turtle in a two-piece, that's just destiny.
[chuckles.]
[sighs.]
[knocks on door.]
[sighs.]
You're the most beautiful person in the world to me.
You know that, right? [chuckles.]
[groans.]
These strike negotiations have lasted so long, it's like Reds in this boardroom.
Remember Reds? Two VHS tapes.
That's too many tapes, I said, but no one listens to Lenny.
How's this look? Generous, but you're making up the projected loss by excising office birthday cakes.
That's unacceptable.
Everybody hates office parties.
Everyone hates the mysterious dried fruit cubes in trail mix but we still eat them after the other nuts and seeds are gone because in our undervalued, overworked existence, we're desperate for any morsel of satisfaction, whether that be cake, unidentifiable orange fruit shards or the occasional kind word from our boss.
I like cake.
They can print those pictures on them now.
What's the issue here? Fine.
But we're grouping birthdays so they only happen once a month.
We accept those terms.
We're left with one final issue.
Your insistence assistants be not treated like garbage? From this day forth, all assistants will be treated like recycling.
Right next to the garbage, but with an understanding that one day, they may be up-cycled to a higher status.
Like a bunch of seatbelts that got turned into a purse.
Or a license plate that gets turned into a purse.
Right, Lenny? Sure, sure.
I'm green.
We're amenable to these terms.
Oh.
Judah.
I meant to reach out There's no need to explain, I know you're very busy with work and Ruthie.
[chuckles.]
You have no idea.
I have some idea.
You talked about it quite often during the negotiations.
This strike has been the most time I've been able to spend with Ruthie since [coos.]
ever.
I also feel an ambivalence about the strike ending.
The negotiations have been quite invigorating.
And now you're just gonna ride off into the sunset? No, the sun sets in the west.
I'm riding east to my Atwater cottage.
[grunts.]
Goodbye.
Judah! Yes? You're the best assistant I ever had.
You don't need ever in that sentence.
It's implied.
[grunting.]
[sighs.]
[indistinct chattering.]
[BoJack groans.]
[exhales.]
Hey! Oh, uh Excuse me.
Mm.
Thank you for meeting me here.
I can't be at my house.
Just reminds me of what an asshole I've been.
Makes sense.
Your house reminds me of what an asshole you've been, too.
[camera shutter clicking.]
Uh what are you doing? I'm updating my asexual dating profile with some fresh pics.
There's still no one else on the app, but when they join, I wanna be ready.
Look at this busted photo.
It's from over a year ago.
Yeah, you gotta stay current.
Oh, man, they always ask for your job.
Oh, I actually have a job! Hype man for babies.
You've really taken to this nanny thing, huh? I love it.
It's so amazing to hold a baby and look at it sleep and think, "This is a perfect thing.
" I can't imagine.
It's weird to think that at one point, someone held me in their hands and thought, "I'm going to love this kid forever," you know? What happened? What happened to what? I don't know.
Moms are weird, right? Um Yeah, moms are weird.
So, what are you gonna do now? Just keep getting lunch with your friends? There was a stewardess in the meeting.
She was talking about how every day, she wakes up in a different place.
I thought, "That sounds perfect.
" Every city a clean slate? Stewardess? I think the preferred term is flight servant.
[soft music playing.]
To us! And depression! [chuckles.]
Yes, but before I drink to that and then depart with you on a cross-country tour of speaking engagements as the quote-unquote "Face of Depression," there is something I feel I must get off my chest.
As it says on the cover of my last single "You Can Tell Me Anything," you can tell me anything.
I am not depressed.
[gasps.]
Wait.
How can you know that? Well, I feel very happy.
Oh, I know.
[sighs.]
Just as I suspected, half-full! Hmm.
That is a troubling development.
And right before our tour! I would be quite upset by this if I were at all prone to depression, which, as we've just established, I am not.
But isn't it possible that you are depressed and just don't know it? Well, I do frequently not know things.
According to the literature for this tour that I did not read but had my mom peruse and then paraphrase for me, people who seem happy can actually be the most depressed.
Oh, no! I seem very happy! I know.
But wait! You seem happy, too! Oh, no, does that mean I'm also depressed? Oh, good thing we're going on this tour.
We gotta get the word out.
A cinnabunny and a coffee, please.
3.
25.
Four and five.
As Gandhi says, "Make the change you wish to see in the world.
" Goodbye, change.
Good luck out there.
I'll miss you.
Uh, what? It's for the best.
Go.
Just go, please.
Don't make it harder than it has to be.
Okay.
[birds chirping.]
[thunder rumbling.]
What is depression? Depression.
Who is depression? You or someone you love.
Where is depression? A grassy field, perhaps.
If any of these words describe you or your feelings, you may suffer from Depression.
depression.
[doorbell rings.]
BoJack? Surprise! Uh, is this a bad time or ? No.
It's just Heat's broken.
Let's go for a walk.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I didn't know.
I was in LA and I didn't want to be, so I'm glad you're here.
You doing okay? I'm doing great.
I have this wonderful boyfriend.
I got an advance on a book of personal essays.
Me, personal essays.
I mean, who am I? Sloane Crosley? Who's Sloane Crosley? Good point.
Who's Sloane Crosley? Yeah, who is Sloane Crosley? Exactly.
But the headline is you're doing great? So great.
[slurps.]
Can I crash at your apartment? No! I think I'm depressed.
Yeah? It started when I was having trouble with my book, and then it kind of snowballed into my boyfriend saying I should take antidepressants.
Are you going to? What's the point? Of antidepressants? I believe the point is to be antidepressed.
Sure.
Or you just flip over the nothing and underneath there's more nothing.
Then you flip over that nothing and there's more nothing underneath that.
So, you just keep flipping over nothings, all your life, because you keep thinking under all that nothing, there's gotta be something, but all you find is nothing.
Sure, but you flip over this pizza box, uh, and look, a couch! We're gonna break up soon anyway.
There's only so long before he gets tired of the real me.
The real you being ? Ta-da! You know, someone got really mad at me recently Mad? At you? I know, shocking.
And he said, "BoJack, you ruin everything.
That's what you are.
" Oof.
And it actually took him saying it out loud for me to realize how stupid that is, even though I believed it for so long.
I bought into this idea that I was a thing that couldn't be changed.
So, the reason I came to Chicago is I wanted to thank you for believing in me when I didn't, and for encouraging me to accept the help I needed.
Hmm.
[melancholic music playing.]
[inhales, groans.]
Hmm.
[wind howling.]
[shudders.]
Hmm.
[groans.]
Mm? [yelps.]
So, I'm really glad you're here, but a little notice next time? Oh, yeah, sorry.
I already made plans with Tawnie.
Hey.
[screams.]
Hi, Tawnie.
Why are you in the backseat? Hollyhock and I are in a fight right now.
It's both minute and massive.
How can it be minute and massive? It's a paradox.
It's Sylvia Plath wearing Saint Laurent.
[groans.]
Wesleyan.
Anyway, we're going to a show.
You're welcome to join us.
Great.
A music show? I love music.
[discordant sounds playing.]
Oh, God, is this what music sounds like when you're sober? Do I hate music? No, this sucks.
I'm just here because I wanted to cheer up Tawnie.
I thought you were in a fight.
Yeah, but I still don't want her to feel bad.
She's my best friend.
They cancelled all the drama classes.
What? Why? The acting professor quit.
He got cast in a regional commercial.
And he quit? Wow.
So, yeah, now Tawnie's gotta change her major, which I get why that sucks, but don't take it out on me.
I'll bet a lot of actors would love to teach at a place like this.
They're not looking for a replacement? Maybe they are.
I don't know.
What do I look like, the Wesleyan Argus? Okay, I don't wanna be fighting anymore, so can we just drop it? You always do this.
I'm trying to move past it.
You said we were gonna meet at Pi CafÃ© for dinner.
I forgot.
Yeah.
That hurt my feelings.
Now we're just supposed to move past it? Ah, I see.
A teachable moment.
Hollyhock, people will disappoint you.
You're always mad at me.
There's nothing I can say.
Yes, some wounds will never be healed.
You could say sorry.
Would it even matter? No, words are meaningless.
Yes.
You do this thing where you don't think you can ever be forgiven, so you don't apologize, but I can't forgive you if you don't say you're sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
That's all I wanted.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Come here.
Mm! That's it? Come on, let's dance.
[chuckles.]
Yeah! Uh [groans.]
[Hollyhock.]
BoJack! I'm really glad you came to visit.
Where are you going next? I don't know.
Where is not winter? California? No, I can't go back there.
Not yet.
Florida? [groans.]
Arizona? Some parts of Texas? [groans.]
I'm telling you, people come to the airport just to eat these things.
But if their houses were made of cinnamon and dough, they wouldn't have to go anywhere! They could eat and live happily in their Cinnabungalow.
Well, I think it's a great idea and this customer thinks so, too.
Right, Lonely Horse Guy? Sure.
He loves it! You better get in on this before there's a bidding war.
[sighs.]
No, I'm not dating anyone.
Stay on topic, Mom.
And Amelia Earhart flew through the skies until one day, she made it to the sun and everybody cheered.
The end.
[knocking on door.]
[Princess Carolyn.]
Oh.
Hey.
I'm out of rehab and I realized I never got you a baby shower gift, so here.
I'm registered at Cubs 'R' Us and Baby Hole, but thanks.
If I'm gonna live in that house again, I wanna get rid of the things that remind me of my old life.
Look what Uncle BoJack brought you, Ruthie.
It's a 1970s pop art interpretation of the Narcissus myth.
How appropriate for a baby.
Narcissus? I thought the painting was about me.
But enough about your baby, I also have a favor to ask.
Of course you do.
There's this drama professor job at Wesleyan.
They need a reference to tell them that I know what I'm talking about, that I'm dependable and passionate.
So, I thought that you could do what you've been doing for 20 years and lie about me.
I'll be back at the office tomorrow.
But have them call my cell because my assistant is terrible.
[cooing.]
Oh, shit, it walks already? She started a few days ago.
[sniffles.]
Oh.
It's okay, she sucks at it now, but she'll get better at it.
I'm gonna miss everything.
We have this connection now.
What if that goes away when I go back to work? So don't go back.
What? I'm dying here, BoJack.
I need my job.
I love my job.
Okay.
It's just There's always so much stupid bullshit to take care of there.
Aren't you the boss? Why are you doing the stupid bullshit? I don't know.
Hey, my only responsibility right now is to not drink and I'm barely getting by.
You are producing a show, running a company, catering to your clients, raising a child, a Todd.
You need your own Princess Carolyn to take care of you.
[Ruthie babbling.]
[both gasp.]
Oh, no! That thing was priceless.
Ah, we'll tape it back together and call it a Rauschenberg.
I've been back in LA two months.
When am I gonna hear about this job? I have other offers, you know.
UCLA, USC, UTI.
[groans.]
Mr.
Horseman, we have to allow other applicants time to apply.
Raven-SymonÃ© is circling.
Raven! She's circling around, portending my doom? Is she gonna swoop in and peck out my chances? That is so like her.
I still can't get comfortable in my house.
It's huge and perfect, but it feels like the worst place on earth.
No offense, Benny, living in your storage locker sounds pretty rough.
Every day, it just keeps getting better.
God, you're killing me, Benny.
My house reminds me of the horse I was before.
I don't wanna be him again.
But it's the same house, the same city, just nothing's changed, so how am I supposed to? Hey.
Sharona, I We don't need to do whatever your sad eyes are asking for.
It was a long time ago.
I'd like to try to The last time I saw you was my rock bottom.
I've been sober ever since.
So it all worked out, okay? Please, just let me say it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It was nice of you to bring Panda Express for everyone.
Right.
Everyone.
[chuckles.]
What do you say? Once more for old time's sake? [scissors snipping.]
I can't believe you have been dying your hair for 20 years.
What color is this? Sharpie? Okay.
I dye my hair.
Nobody makes fun of Dennis Rodman.
They don't? Huh.
What do you think? I look old.
[cell phone ringing.]
Hello? [grunts.]
Raven's out.
She taught a workshop at Spelman and to quote Raven, "Nevermore.
" Spring semester starts next week.
Can you be here? I'll be on the next plane.
Welcome to Wesleyan, Professor.
Is it like a Jesus thing? No, it's not that.
I told you.
I'm just confused, is all.
Because I thought you liked me.
I do, but I was very clear there are certain things that I'm not interested in.
[man.]
So, why did you go out with me in the first place? Because I like you! But it's complicated.
And you're sure it's not a Jesus thing? Fine, if it helps end this conversation, yes, it's a Jesus thing.
Hey, I admire your devotion.
What would Jesus do? Not this guy.
[chuckles.]
It's not a Jesus thing.
I figured.
I don't wanna presume anything, but there's an app you might be interested in.
An app? [snoring.]
[tires screech.]
[groans.]
[woman on PA.]
Welcome to Dulles International Airport.
Looks like it's so icy, all connecting flights have been grounded.
We are happy to offer all passengers a complimentary hotel stay until we can get you on your way.
And the luggage doors are iced shut, so your bags are probably gone forever! Ugh! Thank you for flying with us and enjoy DC.
Huh.
[clears throat.]
Hmm.
[camera shutter clicks.]
[BoJack.]
What? Is that ol' BoJack Horseman? Oh, no, it's old BoJack Horseman! 'Cause your hair is grey.
What are you doing in DC? Addressing Congress, of course.
Getting the word out and raising awareness and so forth.
You're looking at the National Face of Depression! You're the National Face of Depression? Yep! This face? Uh-huh.
You're depressed? Hey, I wanna show you something.
Hey, partner, sit tight.
I'll be right back.
You got it, SD.
Sad Dog.
[chuckles.]
[sniffing.]
Jackpot! You're in a museum! Pretty cool, huh? Huh, that is pretty cool.
Doggy-doggy, what, now? Knick-knack, patty whack Give a dog a bone! [sighs.]
That makes sense.
[panting.]
Well, looks like you finally got your crossover episode.
What? Oh, my God.
Okay.
Is this real? Is this happening? Yeah.
Okay, you knock on the door here.
Excuse me, are you Zachary's father? I think our adopted teens go to school together! Yeah, yeah.
Our teens.
Our adopted teens.
Like you said, they're [in high-pitched voice.]
It's a crossover! They sure have been spending a lot of time together, huh, our teens? [in normal voice.]
I hope they're not having S-E Excuse me.
[sobbing.]
It's just I'm so overwhelmed.
This is the best day! [crying.]
Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh.
He's the National Face of Depression.
[woman.]
We have rescheduled your flight to Connecticut for 8:45 a.
m.
tomorrow.
Please stay on the line for a survey that directly determines whether or not I get fired [phone beeps.]
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
["Take Me Down Easy" playing.]
[knocks on door.]
Come in.
Pardon my state.
I was mid-trek up the Los Angeles Crest when I received your text.
You had a question for me? Yes.
Would you be interested in interviewing for a job here as VIM's Chief of Operations? You'd be a partner with a stake in the company, and a birthday cake just for you.
I would be interested in that interview.
Do you want the job? Yes.
Great.
Interview done.
Your first task is to clear my schedule every third Friday.
I'm taking them off to be with my daughter.
And there's a weird burnt smell coming from the copy room.
I'm familiar with that smell.
I'll investigate right away.
Thanks, Judah.
My pleasure.
[sighs.]
[cell phone chimes.]
Oh.
Huh.
[cell phone buzzes, beeps.]
Hi, Mister! Pickles! Other than being away from you, I gotta say I am having the time of my life being depressed! I'm so glad.
I sense a sadness in your voice, my gherkin.
But maybe not? At this point, I really don't know the difference.
You sensed correctly.
I thought it'd be easy to get even, but I've slept with 32 guys now, if you count the two sets of twins as two and not four.
I do.
And the truth is, none of them are like my Mister.
I just wish I could cheat on you with you.
Mm.
[muffled grunting.]
Hmm? [Joey.]
Whoa.
Uh-oh.
[laughs.]
Hanging in there.
[grunts.]
Hmm I think I may have an idea.
'Cause there was no sunlight Just ask my mother When I treated myself hard Huh! [chuckles.]
I crumble and fall So take me down easy Huh.
Take me down easy Let me land softly [bells tolling.]
Back in your arms My fellow horses, are we doomed to die in the shadow of our sins? [all.]
Nay! Does thy Lord turn His back on His colts? Nay! Nay.
Nay, for to forgive is divine.
Unless thou art a witch, then God wills ye be burnt at the stake.
[clears throat.]
There, Goody Oats! Seize her! No, no, no! [screaming.]
[door slams.]
If God forgives thee, thou must also forgive thyself.
"Though thy sins be like scarlet, they shall be white as snow.
" It is only when we show ourselves forgiveness and mercy that we truly live a life of grace, that we are reborn.
Turn to the horse next to you and offer a sign of grace and peace in the name of the Lord.
[man.]
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Uh, peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
[man.]
And also with you.
Peace be with you.
And that concludes our reenactment of an early Horsey service! Thank you.
[sighs.]
Looks like you found some solace in our show.
Stay if you like.
In 30 minutes, we start over.
A hummingbird smiled at me on my walk this morning.
In small pleasures such as this, I'm reminded of the presence of the Lord.
As you ought.
And yet No.
Out with it, Sister Marguerite.
To hesitate is to waste time, which is a sin when time could be elsewise spent in prayer, or handwashing Monsignor Toscani's 1962 Alfa Romeo, which is itself a form of prayer, is it not? Of course.
Yet I find myself consumed by thoughts of my past.
You have no past.
You've confessed.
Your sins have been washed clean.
This is like day one stuff, what are we talking about here? The people I've hurt, the lives I've ruined, are they washed clean as well? Your regrets are of no benefit to the Lord.
Ruminating so is a solipsism unbefitting a sister of the cloth.
Is it solipsism to be concerned with the fates of others? Perhaps one could argue cloistering oneself from the world is itself a form of solipsism.
[stammers.]
If one were being ungenerous.
Remember when you first arrived here and you didn't talk for like two years? I will trouble you no further, Mother.
Lord, how you challenge me with so vexing a pupil.
[car engine starts.]
Hmm? [shouts.]
What dereliction is this?! When you get to Heaven, look up Margo Martindale! I won't be there, but my movies will! [tires screech.]
[Margo shouts.]
[theme music playing.]
I wanna know what's changed since the strike.
Are assistants treated better or have things reverted to business as usual? Yeah, give me ten inches.
I also want a roast beef sub.
Six inches.
[intercom beeps.]
[woman.]
Paige Sinclair is on her way up.
Ah, shit.
She's the best reporter this building's ever seen, but, goddamn, is that woman a pain in the ass.
[Paige.]
Colleagues! Your eyes do not deceive! You may find my gown overly formal for the workplace, but that is because I am, as of today formerly a member of this vaulted institution.
As I'm to be wed tonight and the newsroom is no room for a domesticated woman, I bid you farewell.
[man screams.]
Okay, goodbye.
Yes, mine was a storied run as the star reporter for "The Reporter.
" "Front Page Paige," they called me! Well, we'll miss you, Paige.
Indeed.
My shoes don't fill easy, my left foot striking a more robust silhouette than her starboard sister.
But I cannot prolong my engagement.
After all, time, as they say, is a river without banks.
Time may not have banks, but this periodical certainly does.
Maximillian Banks, at my service! [scoffs.]
Maximilian Banks.
I may lack your nose for news, but I've got an eyeball for a highball! Why, this man couldn't string together two clauses without ending on a preposition.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You could fill a library with all the things you don't know.
In fact, they do.
They call them libraries.
Guys, we're trying to work here.
No matter, I shan't be staying.
My sweet betrothed, Baxter Bellamy, awaits with champagne to chauffeur me directly to my nuptials, and I didn't think I'd visit long, so I left him in the car with the windows up.
[chuckles.]
Good, I've got business to attend to as well.
I'll have you know it's almost time for my mid-morning confabulation with a former stage mother to the stars, Mrs.
Carol Himmelfarb-Richardson.
You've been taking those phone calls?! Yes, she is as loony as a Canadian dollar, but she is a scintillating conversationalist.
Oh? What about the conversation scintillates? She calls every day to see if we have any information on her dead daughter.
The answer's always no.
Sounds like a scoop.
It's not.
It's a pop star who overdosed.
Open-and-shut case.
All the better for opening and shutting.
Why do you have that? Baxter, my boy, my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom, best put the champagne on ice.
I've got a story that simply demands my attention and I just couldn't marry you before it's settled.
I'd only be distracted, which isn't fair to you or me.
Oh, darling, I've already committed to being your wife.
What, you need to hear a few measly words? Well, "I do.
" Does that satisfy? I do, I do, I do, and I do want you to wait for me to ring you again shortly.
[snorts.]
I knew you'd understand.
Oh.
Mm! [snorts.]
Now, as to the girl.
I smell beans.
Spill 'em.
The girl's name was Sharon Lynn.
It's Sarah Lynn.
Hmm Don't you touch my prickly muffin Did you ever notice that this music video takes place in a planetarium, and Sarah Lynn died in a planetarium? Huh.
Uh Hey, Tawnie.
[music stops.]
Are we going to this party? I didn't come all the way down to Manhattan to just watch you watch your boyfriend be on the internet at his parents' fancy house.
Don't parent-shame him, Hollyhock.
It's not Trey's fault he grew up in an Upper Westside brownstone.
Also, I'm not her boyfriend.
We're uncomplicated like that.
Come on! We're missing the party.
What? No.
If we show up before 2:00, everyone's gonna think we're losers.
Fine.
But can't we do something else while we wait? [gasps.]
Let's explore the city! [sighs.]
[siren wailing.]
The Big Apple.
There she is.
Apparently, there's a bar around here called Hartigan's.
My cousin and his friends call it "They-Don't-Cardigan's.
" I don't get it.
Wow, a real New York bar.
That could be cool.
Yeah, a bar! But how often are we in New York? Let's go to the top of the Empire State Building, like the big ape in that movie, Sleepless in Seattle! All right! Big building! [thunder rumbling.]
Lord, we thank You for this bounty Ella? That place you sent me didn't fix me.
Because I am not a thing to be fixed, Daddy.
Have a seat.
We're havin' bacon-blasted chicken fingers from Chicken-4-Dayz.
I'm not staying.
I'm going to a place where the people accept me.
You sit your ass in that chair, Ella, because that place is right here.
Oh, Daddy! That's what I wish I'd said.
I haven't seen Ella in four years, but every night I bring home dinner, I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted chicken fingers just for her, so that if she ever comes home she'll know that she's welcome at our table.
Huh? Kelsey Jannings, our little indie film darling, I think I speak for both of us when I say gooba, gooba, hey, yah, yah! Tears.
Feel my cheeks.
Damp cheeks over here.
I do notice it's not as Chicken-4-Dayz-focused as maybe it seemed in the outline stage? Talk us through your journey there.
What do you want? You want a close-up of the bucket? Ooh, I think that would make it feel like a commercial, and what's so innovative about this content is that it's not a commercial.
Right, I forgot about the innovative part of it.
Excuse me.
Our target demo responds poorly when they feel they're being advertised to, but they love stories that engage them on their level, utilizing themes of inclusivity, as well as dunking on the olds.
Ah, yes, teens love dunking on olds, is there any way to get more of that in? Well, we already shot the ad.
Not an ad.
The immersive product placement journey.
But maybe I can find takes that are in more of a dunking tone, as well as shots that highlight more prominently but do not feature the bucket of chicken-bacon finger-blasters.
Thank you for letting us help you share your beautiful vision with the world.
No.
Thank you.
[bicycle bell rings.]
[scoffs.]
I'm sorry, it's bullshit.
A gig's a gig.
And Vassar doesn't accept indie cred in lieu of my daughter's tuition.
I just don't believe it.
You're a way better director than I am.
If you'd told me that one day you'd be doing chicken commercials Not a commercial.
That you'd be doing sponsored content pre-roll for Beverly Hillbillies reruns on Gronkle while I'm directing another action-adventure blockbuster, this one set in the world of competitive ballroom dancing, working title, "Balls to the Wall," if you'd told me that You'd be super-stoked? Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked, but then eventually, I would get around to being outraged.
[coughing.]
[groans.]
It is fun that we're both working on the same lot, though.
Right? Yeah.
[cell phone buzzing.]
Sorry.
What now? [man speaking indistinctly.]
Again? Okay.
Yeah.
I'll talk to her.
[phone beeps.]
What are these new pages? Why do I have new pages? You don't like the new pages? [groans.]
The content of the pages is not the issue, Justin.
Yeah.
I spent time preparing the other pages.
You understand? I rehearsed them.
I studied them.
That's precious time I'll never get back! And then some person I don't know this person And by the way, I don't like strange persons knocking on my door and then letting themselves in.
The knock is so I can tell you to enter.
If you just enter, what is the purpose of the knock? You're right, of course.
My point is about the pages.
Why are you throwing new things at me? The insurance guys are nixing the car chase.
We had to think fast, so we put together a new hand-to-hand combat scene we're gonna throw on top of the meringue number.
So, it's a stunt? I thought you'd be excited.
I'm excited! It's more time spent on your face.
Ever since I directed you in that episode of "FBI: Female Body Inspectors," I thought [chuckles.]
"I gotta give this woman her close-up.
" Don't produce me, Justin.
[sighs.]
Is there choreography? When am I learning this stunt? April's gonna be on set.
She'll make sure you understand the stunt.
And it's gonna be safe? We are taking every precaution.
And we are not gonna shoot until you are 100 percent comfortable.
Thank you.
I didn't mean to bite your head off.
I just don't like being surprised, okay? Totally my fault.
I should've warned you.
Is there something else going on that I should know about? I'm fine.
I'm actually being really cool here.
I'm not some kind of monster just because I don't like surprises.
I'm number one on the call sheet.
I'm entitled to a little respect.
No, you're right.
I mean, I've worked on projects where the number one on the call sheet was like an actual crazy person, so I think I'm being really cool.
You are being so cool.
Yeah? Mm-hmm.
[sighs.]
[Gina.]
Can you wait until you're out of earshot to make your exasperated sighs, please? Yes, sorry! [jazz music playing.]
[all.]
Huh? [dogs panting.]
[chuckles.]
Kelsey! You can't compare yourself to Justin Kenyon.
What's the difference? The difference is he has a great agent.
[chuckles.]
That was a joke, but I see you're in no mood.
I'm a good director.
Yes, but Justin's movies make actual money.
The last big movie you were on, you got fired off of.
Explain this to me.
I didn't break into the Nixon Library alone and yet I'm the only one whose career has suffered.
Why do you think that is? Kelse, I don't know by what fancy the fates push us about in their great cosmic dance.
I am but an agent.
What about these stories I keep hearing about how people wanna hire more female directors? Oh, they want to, they want to so bad.
Just not for this particular project.
Which particular project? Anyone.
I mean, you name it.
Whatever Paul Feig's doing.
You need to get me out of director jail.
Even Roman Polanski works more than I do, and he should be in actual jail.
[laughs.]
Yeah, for his last couple of movies, at least, right? Woof! No.
Not for his last couple of movies.
Carol, be a doll and tell this dame what you told me.
I just don't understand why my daughter would start using again.
She was sober.
She was going to AA meetings.
You suspect foul play? Listen to this, the last voicemail I ever got from her, a month before she died.
[beeps.]
[Sarah Lynn.]
Hey, Mommy.
I got out of a meeting and we're making amends, so I just wanted to say I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.
[chuckles.]
I'm sorry my platinum records clashed with the chic minimalism of your new sun room.
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce you as my older sister when we met David Hasselhoff at the Kids' Choice Awards.
And I'm sorry I've never been enough for you, Mommy! What an angel.
She just wanted me to be happy.
What is the "we"? What? Yeah! At the beginning.
She says, "We're making amends.
" Who's this "we"? [camera shutter clicking.]
You know, we don't have to go to this party if you don't want to.
What? I'm the one who keeps saying, "Let's go to the party.
" The only reason I came down here was so we could go to this party and get drunk.
Come on.
I've gone to like a hundred parties with you.
You always say you're gonna drink, and you never do, which is fine, by the way! No one's ever offered me a drink.
I keep waiting for this famous peer pressure I've heard so much about and it never happens! You wanna go have a drink? Here I am, your peer, pressuring you.
[chuckles.]
I'm nervous about losing control, you know? I think drinking alcohol might not be for you.
But I don't wanna be scared of something that's supposed to be fun.
That's why I wanna go to that party with a bunch of strangers.
Because if I'm gonna lose control, I don't want it to be in front of people I know.
Okay, weirdo.
[chuckles.]
You're a weirdo.
Because I am not a thing to be fixed, Daddy.
Do you think we should ADR her saying "Daddy-o"? Is "Daddy-o" more of a dunk? [groans.]
[cell phone rings.]
Hello? Um, hello? Am I speaking to the future director of "Fireflame"?! What's that? "Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie! Ugh.
Another one? Yes, but the difference is this one's about a lady superhero, which means this one you could actually get hired on! I don't want them to hire me just because I'm a woman.
Ugh.
You think Justin Kenyon says, "I don't want them to hire me just because I'm a man"? Of course not! He says, "Money, money, money.
Nom, nom, nom.
" I have heard him say that.
Besides, they don't want this to be just another superhero movie.
They're looking for someone who can make a superhero movie with a twist! So, what, they want me to pitch the twist? No, the twist is that it's a woman.
Oh.
But they do wanna hear your take, by which I mean they want you, as a woman, to tell them their take.
Hmm [man.]
I've been saying for years as soon as we run out of popular male characters and we've given them each two sequels, we have to make a movie about Fireflame! I think that's really edgy and outside the box.
Outside is exactly where we're trying to be, in relation to the box.
We really think Fireflame can connect with today's Yas Queen culture.
Yeah, I got a real Yas Queen vibe from her.
She comes in, she saves the day, everyone loves her! Wow.
Oh.
Didn't I tell you this would make a great movie? Uh, pretty sure I told you, Nancy.
I have always loved Fireflame.
I'm sorry.
I remember now, you did tell me that.
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.
We're obviously gonna hear a lot of takes, but it seems like you have a special connection to the material.
I do.
[elevator dings.]
[chuckles.]
[sighs.]
[Paige snorting.]
Aw.
Aha! I'm famished.
Let's find a place where I can get a glass with an olive in it.
Try to stay on task, won't you, Maxy? If Sarah Lynn was going to meetings here, someone must have seen her, and if someone saw something, then I wanna know it, particularly as it pertains What crime have I committed to deserve so long a sentence? I've got a point.
Once you arrived at it, send me a postcard.
The starlet was alone when she died, right? But there was someone else with her while she was blotto.
Who was that person? What'd they see? And why weren't they mentioned in the police report? There's your who, what and why.
Get a when and a where in there, and we've got ourselves a story.
Bully for you, you're almost caught up to where I was an hour ago.
Let's chat again in an hour when you've gotten to where I'm at now.
Sounds good.
In the meantime, someone in this building might just offer the key that opens the gate to the garden with the tree that bears the fruit that is our scoop.
Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting? I do believe one "A" of the two stands for "anonymous.
" The other "A", I could not possibly fathom.
I envy your faith in the honor and discretion of other people.
Let's see how that honor stacks up against the desire to dish on celebrities so as to appear swank by association.
Excuse me, kind stranger.
I'm writing a story on the efficacy of your program.
Uh-huh.
I understand one of the pillars is anonymity, but if you could I once saw Craig Ferguson here! I don't know why I said that.
[gasps.]
Oh.
I really shouldn't say.
It's anonymous, but I have seen Robert Downey, Jr.
Jamie Lee Curtis winked at me once.
Colin Farrell, Russell Brand, the Ikea Monkey.
Sarah Lynn, I've seen.
Really? About a month before she died.
It was pretty clear she was using.
Well, how do you figure? Did she say something? She didn't, but her friend did.
Her friend? Large fella.
I think he was a horse or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.
Kind of like a rounder Brad Garrett type, but with a very forgettable face.
He told a story, though, I remember that.
It was about a trip he took to New Mexico.
Oh? Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.
Oh, this is so long ago now.
I think he had sex with the girl, or maybe he had sex with the mother? Well, do get your story sorted, but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.
And this man left with Sarah Lynn? Do you recall anything else about this man, his name, perhaps? No, but I remember the girl's name.
Yes, Sarah Lynn, now we're all up to speed.
No, the girl from his story.
The one in New Mexico.
He was weirdly proud of it, said her name was Penny Carson.
Carson, eh? "Penny Carson," he said.
"And that's her real name, you can look her up!" I remember thinking, "Why does he want us to look her up?" [both.]
Hmm.
So she's sexy, but don't you call her sweetheart.
[laughs.]
Boy.
Oh, that is so Fireflame.
[yelps.]
Oh, wow! Stop! What? I'm sorry, I can't let you Uh, excuse me.
Are you already Sorry.
I'm sure she's got a great pitch, but the movie you want, it's just not realistic.
Sure it is.
Wendy Wiggum ate fire as a baby and now she holds the power of the Fireflame.
It's all very logical.
No, I just mean you're doing this all wrong.
She saves the day, and everybody loves her? I mean, yeah, that makes sense if she's a man.
But it's never worked like that for me.
Well, this isn't about you.
That's right! It's about an exotic dancer who's also interdimensional.
No.
I mean the rules are different for women.
If you're a woman and you save the day, nobody loves you.
People take you for granted, or worse, they resent you.
They punish you.
The more powerful you are, the more they'll take your power away.
And I just think if your movie is smart, you'll acknowledge that.
Ooh, yeah, sounds like a bummer.
Yeah, it's a bummer.
Being a superhero is hard.
Otherwise, everyone would do it.
Okay, well, thank you for Maybe that is a bad superhero movie.
Not aspirational enough, I don't know.
But it's real.
And it's different.
Also, in my version, she's gay.
Okay, bye! [door closes.]
[elevator dings.]
[sighs.]
[chuckles.]
[tango music playing.]
You're not bad for a beginner.
Wrong on both counts.
I'm no beginner.
And I'm very bad.
[both humming.]
[groans.]
[shouts.]
Whoa! Ow! What the hell? Cut! Is everyone okay? I don't know.
Do I have a concussion? You fell like a foot.
[groans.]
Why did you drop me? Why'd you scream at me? Hey, guys I didn't know he was gonna dip me.
That's not what we rehearsed! You said to have fun with it.
I meant fun energy.
I didn't mean change the choreography.
I can't do this.
I am number one on the call sheet [overlapping dialogue.]
and all I ask for is a modicum Breaking news! She's number one! of respect and professionalism.
Okay, let's everybody cool down.
Do not tell me to cool down like I'm the crazy person here.
I'm just trying to have a safe workplace environ I had you.
What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm I'm going home.
Gina, we need to get this sequence, and we are already behind.
Not my problem.
I get that you're mad, and you're totally right, but everybody else here Not my problem.
[Gina sighs.]
[grunts.]
You got that dip, though, right? [dance music playing.]
Okay.
Trey and I will be in the coatroom, doing hand stuff.
Otherwise, you don't know anybody here.
[chuckles.]
[indistinct chattering.]
[grunts.]
Hey! Sorry.
[gulping.]
[laughing.]
[groans.]
[snoring.]
[breathing heavily.]
[muffled noise.]
[heart beating.]
[man.]
Oh! What do you see? What? You're having an anxiety attack, so look around the room and tell me what you see.
I-I see people partying and passing out! What else do you see? Um, books.
Pizza boxes.
I see light fixtures.
I see an odd amount of floor poofs.
Okay, now say your name.
Hollyhock.
Last name too.
No, we'll be here all night.
You feel any calmer? Yeah, actually.
A little bit.
It's a trick my psychiatrist taught me.
It's supposed to help you ground yourself.
Thanks.
Except for the saying your name part.
That's not really part of it.
I just wanted to know your name.
Oh.
Okay, cool.
I-I'm Peter, by the way.
Just so you don't have to wait for me to have an anxiety attack too.
[chuckles.]
Hollyhock.
Yeah, I know.
Oh.
[chuckles.]
Right.
So, this party's kind of crowded.
You wanna go get some air? Yeah.
But it's pretty cold out.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
But we're wearing jackets! Also true.
Darling, you must keep the cake cold and the flowers fresh for just a moment longer.
This story has revealed itself to be thornier than a rose bush and just as sweet.
[chuckles.]
When shall I return? Well, I haven't sorted that out yet.
It seems I've gone to New Mexico for a spell.
[wind howls.]
Whoa! Well, we're here.
So I wanted to talk to you because I'm directing a new movie: "Fireflame"! "Fireflame"? Get that money.
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom! Yeah.
So I need an actress.
Someone tough, but vulnerable.
I know you're working with Gina Cazador.
What do you think of her? [stammers.]
Look, if you've seen her work, you know what she can do.
She's very versatile.
Really talented.
But personality-wise, what's she like? Is she good to work with? I can't risk any drama on set.
There's too much riding on this for me.
[sighs.]
If I'm being honest, I can't recommend her.
No? Especially if you have a lot of stunts.
I mean, don't get me wrong, she's great on camera.
She just Uh She can be a little difficult.
What do you mean? I don't know what happened.
I worked with her a couple years ago, she was great, but, um [inhales sharply.]
Oh, you know who'd be perfect? Courtney Portnoy! Oh! I love her.
I've heard nothing but good things.
[gulping.]
[coughs.]
It's fine.
You're not even supposed to like it yet.
It tastes okay-er over time.
Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er over time myself.
You know, I actually didn't even drink for like all of college.
I had some shit go down in high school, and You know, there was this girl in my town.
Anyway, it's a long story.
No, I wanna hear it.
Okay.
She had this man living in her house.
You mean like more than one dad? No, no, she had just the one dad, but then there was this other guy.
Weird.
Totally weird, right? Okay.
So this girl was best friends with my girlfriend.
We all went to prom together: me, my girlfriend, the girl, and the man.
Wait, the man went to prom with you? Yeesh.
That's not even the yeesh-iest part.
This guy bought us bourbon and practically forced us to drink it, and then when my girlfriend got alcohol poisoning, he just ditched us at the ER.
Was your girlfriend okay? Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it was scary in the moment.
We were there all night and they pumped her stomach.
And I was pretty traumatized for a while.
[stammers.]
But things are good now.
Things are good.
Because at some point, I realized it wasn't the alcohol's fault, or Maddy's fault, or my fault.
It was just some shitty dude, you know? Totally.
But you know the craziest part of all? The guy, he's actually kind of famous.
Really? Yeah, I never heard of him, but it turns out he's kind of a movie star.
Who is he? [exhales.]
Um Who is he? 
What is acting? Anyone? Anyone? [grunts.]
Acting is about leaving everything behind, and [clicks tongue, sighs.]
And becoming something completely new.
What is acting? Anyone? Acting is about leaving everything behind, and becoming something completely new.
[exhales deeply.]
[classical music.]
[pants.]
Becoming something completely new.
[sighs.]
[both.]
Huh? [exhales.]
Hey-o! [chuckles nervously.]
Oh What is acting? Anyone? Anyone? Acting is about leaving everything behind and becoming something completely new.
Nailed it.
[grunts.]
And that's a Sharpie.
[theme music playing.]
[clears throat.]
Good morning, my name is Professor Horseman, which will remain on that whiteboard forever, and this is Intermediate Scene Study.
What is acting? Anyone? [all.]
Ooh! Oh! Okay.
You.
According to Stanislothski, acting is the desire to create inside of oneself another, deeper, more interesting life than the one that actually surrounds him or her.
Oh, okay, yes, but also Yes? [girl.]
Oh! Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving truthfully under imaginary circumstances.
" Acting is behaving truthfully under imaginary circumstances.
Uh, okay, wow.
So, that's acting.
But what is? Guys, I'm concerned this class is getting very theory-qua-theory I was about to say that.
when technique should be a means toward a more engaging art.
Well, quite astute.
Sorry, horse professor.
What's acting? Um Acting is the, um [grunts.]
Acting is Uh I don't know what acting is.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I shouldn't be here.
[boy.]
Wow.
[girl.]
Oh! No, I don't want to quit.
I'm acting! That's acting.
Oh! Class dismissed.
But we still have an hour and 20 minutes left.
Yes.
Again, I was acting.
You sounded serious.
Instead of judging my acting, how about you act and I judge you? For real? Yeah.
Good point.
We could show you the scenes we were working on last semester.
Uh, sure.
This is from "Kablammo, Mother.
" Whenever you're ready.
Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II grenade with the pin still in it? [in British accent.]
Why would you want an old thing like that? Tonight, I intend to explode myself.
Where are the extra towels? Okay, okay.
Stop, stop.
What? Does this play take place in England? [normal voice.]
No.
So why are you talking with an English accent? I'm acting.
Just as an exercise, maybe use your normal voice.
And Tawnie, when you're telling your mother you're gonna kill yourself, the next line is, "Where are the extra towels," right? And the character's being very casual, so maybe she should also be casual when she says she's gonna kill herself.
Like it's a big deal, but it's not a big deal for her.
Like that's the irony of the scene.
Whoa! That's really smart.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Okay, let's see it again.
So, darling, what fun and games shall we play? Shall we play Scattergories? [raspy voice.]
I detest Scattergories! Whatever the prompt, you always answer in vague allusions to the baby we never had! Stop.
You're both talking to the audience.
I want you to talk to each other, you're having a conversation.
Hey! Who's you? Who's me? Screw you is who's me! I got the leads.
The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads.
Mm! Them's them good leads.
Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads! Okay, here's my question for you.
Does your character know he's horny for leads, or is he discovering it? Who's next? Great.
What's the scene? The scene is I'm late for my next class.
We were supposed to get out 20 minutes ago.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
See you Wednesday.
Great work today.
Way to go, team.
We did it.
That was great, huh? How good was I? [sighs.]
[door closes.]
Whitfield, we've been here six weeks.
How do you think this is going? I think I'm crushing it.
Wow, okay.
Well, I admire the confidence.
I know you're an acting major.
And I guess I just I wanted to make sure that you're taking other classes.
Like, Economics, or maybe a plumbing course.
Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.
What would you want to do if the acting thing doesn't work out? Hold up, do you think I'm not a good actor? Whoa, whoa, whoa! You said "Not a good actor.
" But now that you've said it Some would say there are no bad actors, only bad teachers.
What about Jason Segel? He was a bad actor in Bad Teacher.
I am a wonderful actor.
You'll see.
[door closes.]
Okay.
She knew I was drunk, but she still let me drive off with Jonathan.
Whoa, oh! I'm a drunk! Jesus, I had no idea, I Booze has taken everything from me.
My job as an airline pilot, my wife.
Huh? What the? Those two things.
[sighs.]
Okay.
I see what's happening.
Sorry, everybody.
This is one of my acting students.
He's trying to, um Who's Whitfield? Nobody said "Whitfield.
" My name is Whip Whitaker.
Did you follow me here? I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.
Drove the plane upside-downsy.
Yeah, I'm drunk now.
Wow.
No, don't We've all been there, man.
He hasn't been there.
That's the plot of the movie Flight.
Glug, glug, glug.
That wet the ol' whistle.
So sorry, everyone.
Now I'm completely over the 0.
8 percent blood alcohol level.
I'm in trouble.
I am wasted.
This is very disrespectful.
Hammered We work hard to create a safe space here.
tanked, blitzed So sorry about that.
I recognize that.
Irish, canned, smashed I value this room, just know that.
annihilated, laced, faded.
Really sorry about all of this.
So sorry.
In conclusion, I am a drunk.
The big D.
Fine.
Shut up.
You're a drunk.
Aha! Wrong, I was acting! It appears the student has become the student-er.
[sighing.]
Wow, an actor.
Uh [grunts.]
[crowd cheering.]
[panting.]
[both grunt.]
Foul! That fowl fouled, ref! Where's the whistle? Ugh! There are women tossing women everywhere! What is this, the Running of the Brides at Filene's Basement? Who's with me? [slurps.]
Okay.
Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby.
What? Really? Also, nobody knows what Filene's Basement is.
That's a shame.
You definitely paid too much for that coat.
[whistle trills.]
Oh, is it over? Did we win? [exhales.]
Hey, you're really good.
I think.
Don't feel like you have to come to these things if it's not your thing.
No, I liked it.
Look at us.
Doing college.
I'm just saying you have your things and I have my things.
It's okay.
You wanna get something to eat? I-I can't.
When we win, we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate.
Sounds fun.
Can I join you? I don't think you should.
It's a bar, and there will be alcohol there.
That's okay.
And young girls.
What's that have to do with anything? Nothing.
Just stating a fact.
Okay.
Well, then, I guess I'll see you.
Wouldn't wanna be you! But I would.
You're cool.
Thank you.
Hmm.
Yes, good.
Keep doing what they're doing.
[sighs.]
Tawnie, you're Hollyhock's best friend We're actually in a fight right now.
Again? Our fights are like Adele songs.
All kind of the same one, but with different specifics.
Well, do you understand this rugby thing? Uh, honestly? No.
She came back from winter break super aggro, but that's Hollyhock, right? Suddenly, she decides, "This is what I'm all about now, and everyone else just has to get on board.
" What are we supposed to do with that? Whoa! I guess get on board.
[whistle trills.]
Get it out, get it Yes, nice.
Nice run! Very nice! Touchdown! That's my sister! Good try! Try? She did it.
She scored.
It's called a try.
Try to keep up.
Hey! Hey! [sighing.]
Yeah! Yes, Cardinals! All right! All right! [both grunt.]
The two teams applaud each other, and then the referees.
As is customary.
See footnote.
We know.
What's up, rugger? Two tries, two conversions, and a drop goal? Jonah Lomu over here.
Great game, Hock.
Oh, Hock.
I like it.
Can I get a nickname too, Regina? How about, "Professor Horseman, adult faculty member"? We have to go.
Yeah, go.
Go.
See you.
See you on the scrumming pitch.
[whistle trills.]
W-E-S-leyan! We will rock and maul and win! Wait.
Where's Hollyhock? You mean Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero Hey.
What the hell? You quit rugby? God.
You sound like three of my dads.
The other five were relieved.
You were good.
I need to focus on my studies.
I'm not just here to get my ya-yas out.
Yeah, but rugby's our thing.
[sighs.]
Okay, then I guess we'll just We'll find a new thing.
How about my thing is reading Gender Trouble by Judith Butler, and your thing is being a teacher? Are you okay? [sighs.]
I'm just busy with school stuff.
You got your showcase in a couple weeks? "An Evening of Modern American Scenes"? Yeah.
I'll I'll go to that.
Great.
I'll see you then.
Yeah, see you then.
Not if I see you first! [phone ringing, beeps.]
Hello? Hey, listen.
It's your very good accountant, Gaz.
Hey, Gaz.
I just noticed you spent a lot of money last year.
Did you go to rehab? Like, a lot? You just noticed that? I've got a ton of clients, okay? And this was a big cocaine year for me.
But we're fine.
Just make another movie, and you'll be fine.
You're working on a movie? No.
Actually, I'm a college professor now.
[sputters.]
What, do you hate money? Gaz Ah, no, no, no, it's fine.
Basically, we're fine.
As I told my wife before she left me, I'm not worried, and you shouldn't be either.
We may need to unload some assets, though.
You still own that restaurant? Elefante? I'd love to dump that money pit, but what idiot would buy it? Sold! On this arrangement.
Of course you're sold.
It was your idea.
Explain it to me one more time? Okay.
You'll spend a lot of time with international superstar sex symbol, Joey Pogo, building a close emotional bond.
After you've established that connection, you'll share one magical evening of intimate sexual congress, after which, we'll finally be even.
You'll marry me, and the two of you will never see each other again.
Well, I guess it's worth a try.
Who's that dog? Mr.
Peanutbutter Excuse me.
[phone beeps.]
Hello? No? Really? Wow, hold on a sec.
Pickles, should I buy Elefante? Ooh! Then you'd be my husband and my boss.
Like Ike and Tina Turn No.
Well, I'm sure there are good examples.
There must be.
But buying a restaurant's a big commitment.
What if I went in on it with you? I like food.
Great idea, Joey Pogo.
I'm in! On you being in.
On it.
With me.
I've got big ideas for this place.
One word lazy Susans.
Hold on.
Before we make any rash decisions, should we maybe consider the long-term [stammers.]
Pickles, this guy on the phone is waiting, and I don't want to be rude.
Sorry.
Of course.
Finish your conversation.
Sold! [phone beeps.]
Now, you were saying? ramifications.
Lazy Susans.
[raspy voice.]
Oh, Heidi, you'll never bag a man with all your talk of feminism, and your grandfather in Switzerland, and all your little goat friends Stop.
Terry, this character is 28.
Is that what you think a 28-year-old sounds like? [normal voice.]
I mean, yes? You do the same old-man voice for every character.
Gotta have a gimmick if I'm gonna make it in the show business.
In "the show business," when they have old man characters, they cast real old men.
I'll show you.
Please don't.
You'll see.
We still have 20 minutes of class left.
I'd driven across that bridge drunk hundreds of times, but never on black ice.
[door opens.]
[Terry in raspy voice.]
Back in my day, we called that "the hidden slipperies.
" Oh, no.
But we didn't go to meetings and talk about our problems.
No, we made moonshine in bathtubs.
Please leave.
Now.
Who's Terry? Nobody said Terry.
Mind if I sit a spell? These old bones need a rest.
Sure, take it easy.
Everyone, this is another one of my students.
I'm very sorry, I have no idea why they think this is gonna impress me.
I just relieved myself in my adult diaper.
Terry Here I am, in the twilight of my years, having drunk it all away.
My job as an airline pilot Wow.
My son You don't have a son.
Not anymore I don't, because I abandoned him.
I abandoned my boy! [Whitfield.]
Papa? My boy! Oh, my God.
Papa? Is that you? I've gone blind, me has, from working in the distillery! Oh, my sweet child! Ugh.
Todd, why don't you and Ruthie go for a stroll while I talk to these acting students? She's just a baby, and I don't want to expose her to too much desperation.
You got it, boss.
[Ruthie giggles.]
Today, we have a very special guest.
This is my friend, Princess Carolyn, who was nice enough to come here to talk about the business of acting.
So, please do not embarrass me.
Oh, no.
How many months until people get discovered, usually? One? Two? [gasps.]
Three? This is more of a comment than a question, but I've seen every Robert Altman movie.
What's the best diner to be discovered in drinking a milkshake? [sighs.]
What if I want to do nudity? Do I still have to sign a waiver? Huh! [yawns.]
Whoo! Hey, who's the kid that didn't ask a question? The brooding kid in the back.
Oh, that's Stan.
That kid's got it.
The look, the sauce, the power to make me feel like a 13-year-old girl, and to make a 13-year-old girl feel like a woman.
I wanna cast him.
You haven't even seen him act.
Is he good? [sighs.]
He's the best actor I got.
I had my doubts when he did the scene from Proof, but when he did the scene from Doubt, I thought, "There's the proof.
" I have to sign him.
No.
Stan needs to finish school.
He's a sophomore.
Great! A legal adult but he looks young.
He can play all the roles that other young, impressionable actors can't because they keep ODing, or going to prison, or going to rehab, or killing themselves.
No, he's not ready.
Why don't we let Stan decide? I want to be your manager.
And I can get you Brooding Birthday Boy on "Birthday Dad" right now.
Stan, LA's not going anywhere.
But you need an education, something to keep you grounded.
Stan, look at me.
You have an opportunity now.
What do you need, a piece of paper? You're done with this place.
Stan? Stan.
Stan, Stan.
One day, you're gonna look back and realize these days on campus, they were the last days you were truly free.
You want "free"? Check out the Smirnoff Ice gifting suite at the Emmy Awards after-party! My whole career, all I wanted was to get to a place like this, and I didn't even know it.
Out there, there's nothing to protect you.
No, but there's a Patagonia jacket that says "Birthday Dad" on it that you get from being on "Birthday Dad.
" We're safe here, Stan.
Please, don't make the mistake I did.
Come on, you'll get your own chair with your name on it! [sighs.]
Damn it.
Oh, good boy.
Yes, he's a good boy.
Okay, first thing, we're gonna get these teeth fixed.
[air horns blaring.]
[vocalizing.]
Marshmallow? Thanks! [munching.]
That was for the child.
Oh, should've specified.
If she can abstain from eating the marshmallow for 15 minutes, she'll receive an even bigger reward.
An even bigger reward than a marshmallow? Remember these times, Ruthie.
Mm-hmm.
[phone beeps.]
[phone buzzes, beeps.]
Go Todd for Maude! You're sitting in front of a marshmallow, and if you don't eat it, you get a bigger reward in 15 minutes.
What do you do? Don't be a sucker, Todd.
Eat the marshmallow.
Who knows what the world's gonna be like in 15 minutes? That's all I needed to hear.
Thanks, Maude.
[phone beeps.]
[Ruthie giggles.]
Oh, no! What have I done? We've got to find another marshmallow! [phone buzzes, beeps.]
Hey, Todd.
You've got the Maude Squad.
Just kidding, it's just Maude.
I don't have a squad.
Maude? I didn't go to college.
Where can I get a marshmallow? The dining hall? Dining hall? This is Wesleyan, not Hogwarts.
What's in a marshmallow anyway? Maybe I can make one.
I think they're mostly chemicals.
To the chemistry lab! [grunts.]
You! Make me a marshmallow! [Ruthie giggles.]
I'm trying to cure brain cancer.
That's not important right now! If I don't get a new marshmallow, some psychiatrist is gonna get mad at this baby.
A psychiatrist? I am so sick of the soft sciences wagging the dog in conversations of behavioral development.
Let's teach them a lesson! I'm sorry, but the experiment's over.
What? Why? Because you ate the marshmallow.
Good day, sir.
Doctor? [gasps.]
You did it! Hello, my name is Willie Wesleyan, and you've won the school, my boy! Wesleyan University is yours.
What? Why? Somebody needs to keep that stuffy old board of trustees in check once I've shed this mortal skin.
Oh Sorry about that.
We're doing LSD research in the room next door.
Come on, Mr.
Phillips.
Time to go.
[laughing.]
The frozzleberries taste like banozzleberries! Yes, Mr.
Phillips, everything tastes like something.
So this is college.
[drum roll.]
[knocks on door.]
You wanted to see me? Amy, yeah.
Um, have a seat.
So we're nearing the end of the semester here, and I'm putting together the cast sheet for the student showcase.
Uh-huh.
This showcase is a big deal.
This might sound crazy coming from famous television star, BoJack Horseman, but in some ways, this showcase means even more to me than the very popular TV shows that, again, I was the star of.
It means a lot to me, too.
Does it? 'Cause you've been missing a lot of classes.
And forgetting your lines.
You seem tired all the time, and I can be better.
I'll prove it.
Okay.
As the water rose, I remember fumbling through the glove compartment, just praying that I could find a pin hammer so I could shatter the window.
Uh, excuse me, is this No.
Nope, no, no, no.
Get out of here.
This has to stop.
What? This is a place for people who are serious about making a change, not for desperate acting students pretending to have problems, Amy.
I was just trying to get help! Oof! [crying.]
Oh! Oops! That was Oops.
Hey, do you know what this show's about? I think it's about to start.
So keep your rugby voice on the field, okay? It turns out my hypothesis was correct.
Kids love marshmallows.
You don't say.
You still working on that memoir? Well, funny story about that Oh, I love when stories start like that! Ooh! You should put this one in your book.
Where the hell is she? Horse professor, we're ready when you are.
Lights.
[applause.]
Hello.
Thank you.
Oh, wow, thank you.
That's very nice, thank you.
Welcome to "An Evening of Modern American Scenes.
" The students are very excited to perform for you tonight.
They've come such a long way over the course of the semester.
Like, a really a really long way.
They were very bad before.
But now Well, I mean, you'll see for yourself, uh But, um, I'm proud of them.
Anyway, first up is a scene from Sam German-Shepherd's "Real America.
" [crowd whooping.]
You think real America's all about cowboys? [line ringing.]
Well, I say real America's about business! And capitalism! [voicemail.]
Hey, it's Hollyhock.
Ugh! Leave a message, if you're a hundred.
God damn it.
I'm starting to think the real America is me kicking your ass! [all gasp.]
BoJack? Oh, shit, your showcase! Tawnie's gonna be so pissed! Forget Tawnie.
I'm pissed! And it's happening right now.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I know your students just have to do a scene, but I have multiple final papers.
If you're implying acting is a bullshit major, you're right.
But people came all the way from California to see my showcase.
From Chicago.
You can't even walk across campus? Okay, let me put some pants on.
You've been avoiding me all semester.
I just have a lot going on.
I go to school here.
I'm a college student.
I thought I'd see you more.
This was mine before you got here.
This was my life, my world, and you just, like, live here now.
And you could have asked me, by the way.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I guess I thought my sister No, don't say that.
Like it means something.
It does mean something.
We don't know each other, really.
What? No, I'm just saying it's fine.
I had a life before I met you, and you had a life before you met me.
I don't want that life.
That life, that person? That's not who I am, I I'm sorry I came here without asking you first.
That was selfish.
Okay.
Thank you.
If this is too weird for you, I don't have to come back next semester.
I can get a job somewhere else.
Tawnie says you're a really good teacher.
She did? Huh.
I thought you were in a fight.
Yeah, but I still love her.
Are we in a fight? Yeah, but [sighs.]
Yeah.
I should get back to the show.
If you want to come back in the fall, that could be cool.
Yeah? Just We need to take things slow, you know? Yeah.
I know.
Thanks.
[Terry in raspy voice.]
And in that moment, I knew this was my home.
[panting.]
And as long as I was here, I'd be safe.
But then again, what do I know? [panting.]
I'm just a 15-year-old boy living in Brighton Beach.
[cheering, applause.]
[woman.]
Yeah! Horse professor.
Come on.
Get up here.
No, no, no.
Get up here.
No, no, no.
Come on.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
[phone ringing.]
[gasps.]
[phone beeps.]
Uh Hello? You need to stop this.
What? The reporters who keep trying to get Penny to tell her story.
What What reporters? Whatever they're doing, I don't want to be included, okay? I don't want my daughter to be included.
Charlotte, I swear, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, you better figure it out.
[phone beeps.]
[breathing heavily.]
[stadium organ music playing.]
[baseball bat cracks.]
[crowd cheering.]
Whoo! Come on, Baby Humans! Oh, oh.
You gotta try a Chicago-style baked potato.
Why does everything have to be "Chicago-style" here? We get it.
We're in Chicago.
Come on.
Just try it.
[scoffs.]
Look at this.
Fork and knife individually wrapped.
So much plastic! Oh! Oops.
Yeah.
"Oops.
" Or the Chicago Baby Humans are owned by the brother of the CEO of Plastico.
And we are thereby complicit in this incestuous money-laundering scheme that's, oh, by the way, killing the planet.
[scoffs.]
But what are you gonna do, right? Pick yourself right up When you're feeling down Friendly smiling faces all around The sun is shining down on you and me Happiness is there for all to see Everybody, come on And get your happy shoes on I said, "Everybody, come on And get your happy shoes on" Whoa, everybody, come on And get your happy shoes on [electricity crackles.]
Good morning, beautiful.
Oh! Wanna go try and hit a Chicago-style museum? Oh, I'd love to, but I really have to work on my book.
Next time.
Great! I've made my romantic offer.
I've officially been a good boyfriend.
I will now retreat to our living room to play video games all day.
[sighs.]
[theme music playing.]
[film reel rolling.]
Hello.
I am Diane, and I am a young girl living in Boston and ever since I was that, I wanted to write good things that were good, this is not good, fix this later.
[grunting.]
Diane, as your father, I am very unsupportive.
Come up with examples of Dad being unsupportive.
Okay, yes.
And, also, the girls from high school.
Hey, I'm Krissy Keating.
Can you use my real name? Check if it's okay to use my real name.
Anyway, I was a real bitch to you, but now maybe you're realizing I was bullied, too? Is any of this interesting? [BoJack.]
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Put me in your book.
Remember I gave you that salad bowl? And I broke the bowl! Answer your phone.
And I glued it back together with gold because I read an article about the Japanese art of kintsugi! And it fell apart again.
It kept falling apart like our marriage! [Mr.
Peanutbutter.]
Is that something? Is any of this anything? [BoJack.]
Diane.
Answer your phone.
I'm calling you right now.
[phone buzzing.]
What? [phone beeps.]
Hello? [BoJack.]
Hey, Diane.
If I had my shitty students do a night of scenes here at the end of the semester, would you come see it? It's gonna suck, so I wanna pack the house with friendly faces.
When you sell it like that, how can I resist? How's that book coming? I'm actually at the mall, writing it now.
Why are you writing at the mall? I couldn't focus at home and this is the only place I could sit and work for ten hours.
I can get lunch here, I can people-watch, all without having to endure what the Chicagoans refer to as "spring.
" Hey, Chicago, 49 degrees is not spring.
It's the non-Lachey half of a boy band.
What? Forty-nine! Half of 98? Diane, don't workshop your material in casual conversation.
Howie Mandel used to do it, too.
Like, really, Howie? You just happened to have a rubber glove in your pocket? All I need to do now is actually write my book.
I have so many stories to tell, but I can't seem to figure out what the book is.
You gonna put any stories about me in there? I think I've written about you enough.
But no one else is as good at it! I'm sure someone will rise to the occasion.
Baxter, darling, I've just a moment to update you on the progress of our Penny Carson crusade.
So far, we've been able to contact three of the four Penny Carsons listed in New Mexico.
Baxter, there's nowhere I'd rather be than on our honeymoon cruise to "Unjuga," but I simply can't stop now.
We're on the lookout for the fourth Penny, and, God willing, she'll be the lucky one.
Oh! Hey.
Caw-caw! Caw-caw! [gasps.]
Oh [stammers.]
Sorry, I didn't mean you.
Paige! [gasps.]
Kisses, Baxter dear, it appears we've found our deer.
Okay.
Book, here we go.
I grow up in Boston town because my father, who I never was close with, live in Boston.
That's not right English, I'll fix it later.
Me from Boston.
Well, you're not from Boston, but yeah.
Whatever for now.
Beantown.
To really understand what it's like to grow up in Boston, you actually have to go back 250 years to the Boston Tea Party.
Taxation without representation is wicked unjust, bro! Bro, check it out.
I'm teabaggin' the harbor.
Oh, no freakin' way.
[laughs.]
[grunts.]
Go, Pats.
Unrelated.
[Diane.]
Stop.
I'm getting distracted.
Why can't you stay focused? What's wrong with your head, Deedee? The idea behind the Japanese art of kintsugi is that cracks in an object are part of its history.
What does that have to do with anything? We have to look at trauma! Ugh.
[woman.]
We totally have to look at Trauma.
What? There's a spring sale.
Forty percent off.
Ooh! [grunting, groans.]
[Ivy.]
Did you hear security still can't figure out who's stealing wallets? Like [scoffs.]
I bet my life it's that hag Devon from the hair crimper cart.
Oh, my God, yes, that theory is beast, Ivy.
Excuse me, I'm sorry We forgive you.
You know the story about Gemberly, right? What they found in her locker? Tell me.
It was a I meant "Pardon me, I need another size.
" But I can't seem to find a number on the tag? We don't see size here at Trauma.
Okay, but can you help me? Sure.
I think it would help if you figured out why you need to put a number on your body, and let me get back to this mystery.
Thanks.
[grunts.]
[phone buzzing, beeps.]
Hello? [Ivy.]
Oh, my God, she's like taking a phone call.
Diane! Great news! "Birthday Dad" premiered last night to a 0.
006, which is the biggest network hit since the inventor of blood-scented perfume went on Shark Tank and got her arm bitten off.
Great! Meanwhile, my company's running like gangbusters.
Is gangbusters a slur of some sort? Can we still say gangbusters? I'll look into it.
And with Todd watching the baby, my work-life balance is on point.
Did you call me just to brag? I was thinking What would make my work-life balance even on pointier? And it hit me: more work! So, I thought I'd check in and see how your book's doing.
Oh.
I'm still kind of figuring out what the "is" of it is, you know? It's been six months.
Okay, I think it's about Trauma.
Trauma? Or damage.
You know, those bowls that break and then the cracks get filled with gold and then they're even more beautiful? Maybe it's like that, you know? Like, we've all been damaged, but it's good damage because it makes us more who we are.
Is that anything? Yeah, good damage.
I like it.
Send me the pages and we'll get 'em to the publisher.
Okay, but no hurry? Okay, but, no.
Hurry.
What can I get ya? Some information with a side order of revelation.
Is that a type of pasta? Oh, also a water.
I am parched.
In fact, why don't you freeze that water into a cube shape and drop it in some bourbon.
We're looking to identify an associate of Sarah Lynn's.
Sarah Lynn? Is this about BoJack? Is it about BoJack? I don't know what you're looking for, but I don't know anything about it.
Okay? I haven't seen BoJack in years.
Or Sarah Lynn.
But you have seen them? I'm gonna go ask the kitchen about your pasta.
BoJack? Wait, that's the fellow from the police report, who found the dead girl in the planetarium.
Yes? Found the dead girl.
Are you smelling what I'm smelling? [snorts.]
If he was also with her at the AA meeting Well, then why wouldn't he mention it to the police? What's he hiding? You're starting to make more sense than a change machine.
Yeah, speaking of cents, what happened to Penny? Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop! Go, go, go! Gotta stay in the loop! "So in a way, that salad bowl was me, and the cracks were also me" Ugh! It sucks, I'm sorry.
It's a first draft.
I can't remember what happened when and I keep getting distracted.
It's because of the meds.
This is what I was afraid would happen.
But isn't it worth it? You've been feeling so much better, right? I do feel lighter, and clearer, but also so foggy.
You feel clear and foggy? How is that even possible? I don't know! Because of the fog.
Hey.
Stick with it.
With the writing? Or the fog? Both.
Okay.
So, start at the beginning.
I'm a baby.
[Todd.]
Hey, baby! Isn't it great to grow up in a comfortable upper-middle class home, surrounded by love? But I didn't grow up surrounded by love.
That's the problem.
You were fine! Name one example of me being a bad dad.
Uh, okay! What about how you made me lose on purpose at Boggle so my brothers would think they were, quote, "wicked smarter than a girl.
" That's all you got? I got other things! There was lots of shit.
Constantly! I just can't express Is this what your book is? Just you complaining? As your target audience, I'm not hooked yet.
You are not my target audience.
[Ivy.]
This book is like bore me with a spoon, Diane.
You know the story about Gemberly, right? What they found in her locker? Tell me.
It was a note from the thief, saying where all the wallets were hidden.
What? What is this? I'm trying to write about my childhood trauma.
Who are you? I'm Ivy.
My mom and I just moved to Chicago from Southern California.
[Diane.]
What? No.
I can't My dad died and we needed a new start.
I don't really get Chicago yet, and the winters are cold AF, so I hang out at the mall a lot.
Malls are fun! Or "beast," which is slang that young people like me say.
You're Ivy Tran, right? Ivy T.
That's me! I-I need help.
Someone's been filching onesies by the twosies from the fourth floor Baby Hole, and if I don't figure out whodunnit, my manager's gonna mount my head on the wall! Yes, managers can be very annoying.
I'll take the case.
Oh, and, also, I'm Vietnamese-American.
[moose.]
Beast.
"Ivy Tran, Food Court Detective"? Well, I like this.
It's fun.
My book is supposed to be a profound treatise on damage.
But I can't even access my damage.
I'm too hopped up on goof-berries! What the hell is a goof-berry? I need to go to a dark place, and I can't get there.
When I'm with you, when we're out, I feel good, I feel happy, but the minute I sit down to write You were having trouble writing this book when you were depressed, and you're having trouble now that you're not depressed.
Is it possible that you just What? That I'm just a shitty writer? No.
That you just don't wanna write this book.
I do, though.
It's just hard.
But that means it's worthwhile.
Good things are hard.
I'm not writing The Mall-related Mysteries of Ivy Tran! [chuckles.]
Why not? Guy, come on.
No.
You come on.
You come on.
Diane, I'm gonna tell you what I always tell my good friend Eileen.
Don't do it.
Eileen, come on.
[scoffs, chuckles.]
More drugs, please! [phone buzzes, beeps.]
Hello? I soft-pitched your book to Brad Pitt's company, Plan B, and Craig Bierko's company, Plan C.
They're very excited about the movie adaptation.
What movie adaptation? Gee, I don't know, a new Robin Hood adaptation.
No, Diane, the adaptation of your book! What book? Come to think of it, a new Robin Hood sounds pretty good.
Judah! Maybe from Maid Marian's point of view? Directed by Sofia Coppola? I'll try Rebecca Ferguson's agent.
[Diane.]
You're still on the phone with me! Oh, right.
The town has really responded to your pitch about damage.
It wasn't a pitch! Imagine, all the little Dianes out there, just waiting to see their story on the big screen during a brief Oscar-qualifying run in New York and LA.
You don't think it's too sad, do you? It wouldn't be better if I wrote something more fun? Diane, sad is the new fun.
Besides, the sad is what makes it you! Really? Yes! Everyone's very excited.
But they wanna see pages.
So, do what you do and get me that sad! Just got back word from Sofia.
She's booked for the next year developing a new Peter Pan from Wendy's point of view, and Rebecca's doing a limited series about the female ticket-taker at the cinema where Batman's parents got shot.
Ooh, that's really empowering.
Diane, I gotta go.
Uh Ngu-yen? N-Ngu-yen? No one? [Charlotte humming.]
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Pen! What's wrong? Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.
A girl can't visit her mom? Why are you grilling me? Slow down.
Breathe.
Something happened at work.
Something? [both gasp.]
Or someone s? Did you follow me home? If you didn't wanna be followed, you should have been more judicious with the turn signal.
A lady doesn't need to always announce where she's headed.
Yes.
Who taught you how to drive? Uh, can I help you? Paige Sinclair, intrepid gal reporter.
And I'm Max! Okay.
We're circling a story on the last days of Sarah Lynn and we're trying to nail down a timeline.
We think your BoJack Horseman may have played a part.
[snorts.]
I think you should go.
Well, it was worth a try.
Actually, I did see Sarah Lynn.
Right before she died.
Oh! It was very worth a try.
She came to Oberlin.
With BoJack.
Whoa! BoJack came to Oberlin? And what happened? Nothing.
I mean Why didn't you tell me? I saw them and told BoJack to leave.
That's it.
Were they intoxicated? Is BoJack ever not intoxicated? Would you go on the record? No, she won't.
Excuse us, we are just about to sit down to dinner.
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk? Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk? Penny I'm not a kid, okay? We should tell them about Maddy.
No Who's Maddy? My best friend in high school.
BoJack was living here and he bought her booze before the prom and then she got alcohol poisoning.
I'm sorry, he was living here? Oh, what's this, a party? [gasps.]
Did you guys forget to invite Kyle? Dad [sighs.]
Ah, just kidding.
Now it's a party.
Kyle, these folks are from the refrigerator repair company.
And I just told them that our refrigerator is working fine and they were just leaving.
Quite.
If you think of anything else, please do give us a call.
Ah.
You know, the wine fridge has actually been acting kind of funky.
Two refrigerators? Ha! Give my regards to the Rockafellers.
[Charlotte sighs.]
[whistling.]
[grunting.]
Can you keep it down, please? I couldn't sleep and you're like shout-whistling at me.
Hey, I'm just whistling.
Chicago-style.
Don't.
Just please be quiet.
I need to write.
Okay.
Okay.
Write on.
[exhales sharply.]
Hey, how was the writing? What do you mean? You were gonna write today.
[Diane.]
Oh, is the day over? I was just thinking my thoughts Are you all right? [crying.]
Oh! Oh, my God! Diane, what's wrong? I [retching, coughing.]
Oh, oh, oh! It's okay.
I got it in the plant.
Oh! Not in the toilet? I'm not gonna put my face in your toilet.
Don't be gross.
Our toilet, baby.
We've been over this.
I had to think fast.
Went for the plant.
Okay, but the sink? Or the shower? There's so many drains in there.
I'm sorry.
I gotta work.
Hey.
[sighs.]
Maybe you can just go back to bed and you can work in the morning.
No.
Now.
Gotta get it done.
[keyboard clacking.]
I'm 17 years old.
I live in Boston.
Krissy Keating's a real bitch to me.
Was I? Or did you deserve it? I deserved it.
Your problem is you always blame other people, Deedee.
I know.
Who's a good baby? Not you! Where are my pages, Diane? I need pages for my beautiful celebrities, such as Stockard Channing, Tatum O'Neal, Patrick Harrison Ford Focus.
I'm trying to focus.
I'm trying to get to the truth.
I think you're afraid of the truth.
No.
Your damage isn't interesting and you're unworthy of love.
No, I'm not! Of course you are! Are you, uh, you know, one of those stupid pop culture analogies I'm always doing? Because you're charming at first, but eventually enough already! You think you're a beautiful salad bowl? [scoffs.]
Conceited much? More like garden-variety, am I right? [Diane's Dad.]
You blame everyone else for all your problems, but you're the one constant here.
Go Pats.
You're right.
[breathing heavily.]
Diane, what is going on? There's a heaviness on my chest.
And it's not just my boobs, even though, yes, my boobs are heavier now.
Hey.
Talk to me.
I stopped taking my meds.
Why? Because I'm terrible! I'm a stupid person! I deserve this! No.
You're not a stupid person, but you can't just I want to die! It's so much worse than before.
Baby, you're going through withdrawal.
Do I just have to be on drugs forever now? How am I gonna finish my book? Okay, forget about the book for a second.
I can't! It's the only thing that matters.
Now, that's not true.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just take your pills.
All right? Then when you even out we can talk about trying something else, okay? Okay.
I just-just wanna be a beautiful salad bowl.
You are a beautiful salad bowl.
How're you doing? A little better today.
And, uh, I wanted to say sorry.
For what? I don't know.
"Being Diane"? Stop.
I let the stress get to me.
I should just call Princess Carolyn and tell her I need more time.
Yes.
But before you do that don't be mad.
Don't be mad about what? If I tell you, will you be mad? From the tone of this conversation, I'm guessing probably.
Okay, what you have to remember is that you were in a really dark place.
And the pressure from Princess Carolyn wasn't helping.
I thought if I could get her off your back for a few days What did you do? [phone buzzing.]
Guy, what did you do? I sent her the Ivy Tran: Food Court Detective pages.
What? I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
Okay? I made an executive decision! You're not an executive! I-I made a boyfriend decision! All right? I made a "my girlfriend is a depressed, vomiting mess and someone needs to make a decision" decision.
Ugh! Hello? No.
[Princess Carolyn.]
Loved it! I love the protagonist, I love the world, I love that it wasn't your sad memoir about your boring life.
What happened to "sad is the new fun"? I didn't know you could write this fun! You gotta finish this thing.
I'm on pins and needles, and I'm not just saying that because I live with a porcupine.
Listen To the ka-ching, ka-ching of the middle-grade IP market? Done! I slipped the pages to a few studios.
This has franchise potential.
Franch potench.
But what I'm saying is that it doesn't, because that's not the book I'm writing.
I'm hearing a maybe.
I'm not [groans.]
Are we gonna have a Boston-style fight now? [grunts.]
[Ivy.]
Here's a mystery.
Why are you so sad-core? I don't know.
Just be fun and popular like me.
I don't know how.
Sure, you do! I'm clever and free-spirited and a little bit sardonic but not so much that it's off-putting.
I have vulnerabilities like everybody else but just enough to make me relatable.
That's the way to be.
It's not that easy.
Yeah, I know.
But wouldn't it be nice if it was? [Ruthie cooing.]
Where's Princess Carolyn? She said we should save her a seat.
You still working on that memoir? Well, funny story about that Oh, I love when stories start like that! Ooh! You should put this one in your book.
Hello.
Thank you.
[cheering.]
Oh, wow.
Thank you.
That's very nice.
Thank you.
Welcome to "An Evening of Modern American Scenes.
" Oh, excuse me.
[sighs.]
We have to talk.
Shh.
Diane! Don't be rude to the actors.
[scoffs.]
For most of them, this'll be the height of their career.
[BoJack.]
Anyway, first up is a scene from Sam German-Shepard's "Real America.
" [audience cheering.]
[Kyle laughing.]
Char, hey, you gotta get in here! This episode of "Birthday Dad" is an all-timer! Penny I wanted to get something.
[grunting.]
[sighs.]
I don't feel good about what happened with those reporters.
It's okay.
We didn't tell them everything.
I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't.
I know that's messed up, but I think I look nice here.
Oh! You look beautiful.
I don't think that's the only reason I kept the photo, Mom.
It's all really confusing.
[Kyle.]
Charlotte! Birthday Dad just got trapped in a leap year! How's he gonna wriggle outta this one? In a minute, honey! Stuff happened to us, okay? And he's still out there.
Penny If we can get the word out, if-if people knew It won't be just him in the story.
It'll be you and me.
The mistakes we made.
Mistakes I made, that I will never forgive myself for.
But if we can help other people, then it will have been for something, you know? It won't just be this thing to feel bad about forever.
You don't know what's gonna happen with the story once it's out there.
You have no power over it.
And you just got your panic attacks under control.
Yeah, I know, but I love that you want to do what's right, but please just think about it, okay? Just give it a couple days and then if you still want to talk to them, you can call them.
[sighs.]
Okay.
Thank you.
You wanna stay and watch "Birthday Dad"? Stay the night? No, I-I should go.
Okay.
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you, too.
[sighs.]
[Kyle.]
Oh! Is that the International Date Line? Don't go over the date line, Birthday Dad! Because then it won't be your birthday anymore! [laughs.]
[cheering.]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Come on, Todd, let's go.
But I wanna see if there's an after-credits scene.
[Princess Carolyn.]
Talk soon, Diane.
Hey, wait a minute.
[door opens, closes.]
Princess Carolyn.
[grunts.]
Princess Carolyn, wait.
I understand you're trying to be helpful, in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.
Oh, thank you.
But I don't wanna write a middle-grade fiction detective series.
I think you do, though.
Because when I was reading it, I could tell you were having fun.
Yeah, but I'm not writing a book to have fun.
If I don't write my book of essays now, I never will! So? Don't write your book of essays.
I have to! Why? Because if I don't, that means that all the damage I got isn't good damage, it's just damage.
I have gotten nothing out of it, and all those years I was miserable was for nothing.
I could have been happy this whole time and written books about girl detectives and been cheerful and popular and had good parents, is that what you're saying? What was it all for? I [sighs.]
I don't know, Diane.
All I know is that this book about the girl detective is fun.
I liked it.
I like thinking that my daughter could grow up in a world with books like that.
Or if my daughter's not a reader, a lucrative film adaptation.
When I was a little girl, I thought that everything, all the abuse and neglect, it somehow made me special, and I decided that one day I would write something that would make little girls like me feel less alone.
And if I can't write that book Then Then maybe write this other book.
Maybe this book does that, too.
Yeah? [Ruthie giggles.]
[toy squeaks.]
Uh Princess Carolyn? What reporters? BoJack? Charlotte, I swear, I don't know what you're talking about.
[line disconnects.]
[hyperventilating.]
Hey, man, great show.
What? Huh? Uh [groans.]
Oh, no! BoJack! Oh!
Watch out! Lift with your legs.
I am lifting with my legs.
Also lift with your arms.
[Joshua.]
Is Horse Professor okay? Nothing to see here! He just passed out from pride! Because you kids are so talented! [students cheering.]
You think he passed out from embarrassment? Because the kids are not talented.
What happened? He was getting off a phone call.
I had some constructive criticism about his play.
I tried a compliment sandwich by starting with some praise, but he passed out! Just goes to show, you never know how much time you have with someone, so you should always say the bad stuff first.
[gasping.]
BoJack! Your play sucked! They found out.
I didn't It's not true.
What's not true? I need to Air.
[students singing.]
For he's our trusty director No.
They can't know.
I didn't even do anything.
It's Slow down.
Why don't you tell us what happened? Okay, I'll tell you.
But you can't talk to anyone.
No reporters.
BoJack, it's okay.
No one's gonna talk to any Reporters? With questions about my good friend, BoJack Horseman? I'd be delighted to talk! [theme music playing.]
[music playing over stereo.]
Oh, Baxter, my endlessly encouraging enfianced.
I'm thrilled to report our return from a prolonged New Mexican exodus.
True, Max and I shared lodging to husband our expenditures, and true, too, we showered together one night when the tank broke down and the hot water was scarce, but other than those mild inconveniences, the fact-finding mission went as fine as the print at the bottom of a contract, and we're close as ever to sewing things up.
So, BoJack sold the restaurant to Joey Pogo and me, and we relaunched it with my fiancÃ©e Pickles as a themed eatery.
What is the theme? Pickles wanted small plates, Joey wanted lazy Susans, and I wanted the theme to be my face is on the front of the menu.
So, we did all three! [laughs.]
What's the big idea? I'm in the middle of eating! Huh? It's the perfect compromise because everybody got what they wanted, and nobody had to compromise! And why is it called Ele-fee-no? Ele-fi-no.
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know! I know this last story is taking its sweet time, but once we can tie down this Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynn on the night of her death, we'll know he procured the final blow, the blow being not blow but horse, a scoop in itself, but I believe the larger story is Oh, but here I am bending your ear.
Your everlasting patience inspires me.
Do return my call.
This is Paige Sinclair.
And then I took the boat back to LA.
That's it? How's that a story? You did nothing illegal, and even the not illegal thing, you didn't even do.
And yet this thing continues to haunt me, I Because it's not about the legality.
[Todd.]
Diane's right.
That story is super sketchy.
Is BoJack super sketchy? Yes, he is! [Ruthie laughs.]
[pounds on door.]
Can Horse Professor come out? We won't go to the cast party unless our fearless teacher comes with us! Why don't you just have the party here and he'll pop out when he's ready.
Here's some cash.
Go buy some nice cast party things.
[students cheering.]
[Joshua.]
This is gonna be the best night ever! Okay, okay, you're right.
I've been sketchy.
But there's no story here.
Right? Unless New Mexico isn't the story.
Uh, what? I'm just saying, if I tried to pitch that story, no one would publish it.
They're working on something bigger.
What did you do this time? I haven't done anything.
Since I got out of rehab I have been on my best behavior.
But before rehab No.
They can't get me on old shit.
I'm a different person now.
This could be anything.
Or a combination of things.
They're gonna combo me? Let's take a beat and figure out what this story is.
Todd, earmuffs.
On it.
BoJack, tell us every bad thing you ever did.
[sighs.]
This is gonna be a long night.
So, what can I tell you about BoJack? Nothing bad, though.
[laughs.]
It's gonna be a short night! Right.
I Your chair, Miss Sinclair.
Thanks, Mr.
Banks.
And thank you, Mr.
Peanutbutter, for taking the time to quench our queries.
This shouldn't take more than a half hour, max.
Yes? No, not you Max.
Then who Max? No, Max.
I'm talking to Mr.
Peanutbutter.
No, you're talking to Max.
I'm Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Now I'm talking to Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Glad we're all on the same page.
I beg your pardon.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, we have sitch in the kitch.
It's a dishwash ish.
The dishwashers all quit? It's the small plates.
If we just had bigger plates, we could get more stuff on them and we wouldn't need so many.
The point of the small plates is to curate a personalized dining experience, but because of your lazy Susans, all the plates keep getting spun around and nobody remembers who ordered what! Oof! And then there's me, putting my picture on the menu! What? No one cares about that.
Yeah, the pic's not the problem.
All right.
JoPo go, why don't you start on those dishes? You got it, good buddy.
Oh [sighs.]
Pickles, you keep manning the tables.
Those Susans aren't gonna laze themselves.
Sure.
But Could I talk to you? How much longer do we have to keep working with that guy? I thought you loved Joey Pogo! I love his music! He's my second favorite recording artist after Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats to study/relax to.
I love Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats to study/relax to! And I love you! But Joey Pogo's like your total opposite! He's arrogant, annoyingly cheerful, and fake-nice.
You are confident, refreshingly optimistic, and wryly sweet with an ironic self-aware edge that reads to some as inauthentic, but I recognize as archly sincere! Total opposites! Okay.
So, Pogo's not gonna work, but I guess we keep trying? I can proposition some young men on set.
That should end well.
No, I'm sorry.
I want this to work.
I'll try to make it work.
For us.
Now, if we're to finish this story, we need to stay focused.
The last days of Sarah Lynn.
I'm telling you, the story is bigger than just the one girl! If we pivot our perspective so we prove a larger pattern, we can paint a clearer portrait of a problematic person for a page-one profile that'll pave our path to a Pulitzer! Paige, please! At the rate we're going, we'll never file the story, you'll remain unmarried, and I'll be stuck bickering with you until the day I die! Oh, poor baby.
Sorry, where were we? We wanted to ask you about Sarah Lynn.
Oh.
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.
Oh, brother.
Would you say BoJack is a good person? Unequivocally, more or less.
More-more or more-less? Uh Yes, but back to Sarah Lynn We're trying to understand if your friend has ever exhibited certain patterns Argyle? Herringbone? That man can pull off anything! We're wasting time.
Did Sarah Lynn ac [dishes crash.]
Whoa! I told you not to spin it that fast! Lazy! Lazy! I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to be washing dishes? [both panting.]
[scoffs.]
Hey! Where are you going? Okay, let the cat out of the bag so my curiosity can kill it.
What is going on with those two? That's a personal matter.
I'll tell you all about it! [students.]
Cast party! Cast party! We are having a cast party! [cheers.]
[student 1.]
Yeah! They didn't even buy alcohol! Just a disco ball and some capes? These are all the bad things you think you did? I swear, this is all I can think of! None of these are big stories! We all know there are more things.
Jesus Christ.
What's the point of working on myself and getting sober and getting better if no matter what, there are people out there just waiting to tear me down? BoJack, no.
No, it's not fair.
If you start listing every single thing everyone's done, then everyone's a monster.
Nobody's Who are these reporters, anyway? They're so perfect? I'll bet there's dirt on them we could dig up! I don't think that's it That'll teach those bloodthirsty leeches what happens when they try to tear someone down over their past without even considering the possibility that he's changed! Have you changed? Yes, obviously.
Because this feels like old BoJack.
I like the BoJack who's thoughtful and directs plays that are emotionally resonant despite the glaring logical gaps in the plot.
It was a showcase of separate scenes! There was no plot! I need to go put Ruthie to bed.
Call me when new BoJack's back.
[door opens, closes.]
You didn't do any of the dishes? Manual labor featuring me is just not a fruitful collab.
So I just went out and bought 500 new ones.
Why did Mister think I'd like you? When I'm with him, we finish each other's sentences.
Meanwhile, you are always Interrupting, just to say the exact thing that you were going to? Yes! It's so Annoying? Thank you.
That's the word.
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.
You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.
What if we just tell Mister we've formed an emotional bond, then we can have sex, and we'll never have to see each other again! Why don't we just tell him we had sex? I can't lie to my fiancÃ© about sex! That's what got us into this mess in the first place! [scoffs.]
So, as soon as they go to bed with each other, we can put this whole thing to bed, but the problem is She loves him.
No, the opposite.
No, the opposite of the opposite.
The very thing itself: she loves him.
Why do you say that? You've got irises, haven't you? And pupils and corneas? You might even say you've got a pair of eyes.
Optic nerve? Yes.
So how could you not see the way that she follows him across the restaurant like the puppy dog she is? How they bicker and flirt? Why would she fall for a dashing cad like Joey Pogo when she's already engaged to sweet, dependable, predictable, safe, boring, perfectly adequate Mr.
Peanutbutter? Thank you.
She only tolerates that other fellow because she has to, for work.
Otherwise she finds him utterly distasteful.
Piggish even! No offense to me.
None taken, of course.
[snorts.]
No, she loves him, though she'd never admit it, even to herself.
[gasps.]
And what about the boy? Sure, he puts up a front and picks a good fight, but to just once hear those stupid words "I love you" tumble out of her foolish mouth would drop his heart down an elevator shaft and bounce it back up to his throat.
Yes? Yes.
I'm pretty sure they hate each other.
Uh I Well, that's all very [breathing rapidly.]
Back to BoJack! And Sarah Lynn.
Would you say BoJack's relationship with her ever bordered on inappropriate in the weeks leading up to her death? No! They were closer than thieves! They were thieves, actually.
They broke into my house together, like great friends do, and stole our clothes.
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back! But she was able to find another one shortly thereafter that looked exactly the same.
Pardon me.
Hello.
Joseph? Can I get an announcement drumroll, please? [beatboxing.]
Never mind.
Joey and I have developed feelings for each other.
Oh! [sputtering.]
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but No, that's wonderful.
It's exactly what we wanted.
It is! So now we make love, after which we can all get on with our lives.
Great! This is good.
Look, we're not gonna figure this out tonight.
Maybe I should just go to the cast party and try to enjoy [Diane and Carolyn gasp.]
[phone buzzing.]
[phone beeps.]
Hello? Yes.
Um, speaking.
Oh, hello, Paige Sinclair, of the "Hollywoo Reporter.
" [BoJack and Carolyn gasp.]
Yes, I know BoJack Horseman.
Uh What night? Did I see BoJack with Uh Listen, I'd love to talk more, but, uh, I cut my finger earlier in a bagel guillotine and I think I require medical attention, goodbye.
Bagellotine.
[phone beeps.]
It's Sarah Lynn.
Their story is about you and Sarah Lynn.
[exhales sharply.]
[Pickles sighs.]
Well, uh, that was Wow.
Yeah.
Well, see ya later.
[shuddering.]
Oh.
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick to you earlier.
The truth is, since Mr.
Peanutbutter has been such a good friend and chill hang, I was nervous I would feel weird smashing his fiancÃ©e, but once we were in it, it was like we were two naked hearts raw and exposed but safe in the home we found in each other.
Yeah.
Did you just come up with that? No, it's from my new song, "Two Naked Hearts (Raw Dog Remix).
" Oh.
Sounds like another banger.
Best of luck with your wedding.
One day I hope to have what you two have.
Right now, I couldn't even imagine getting married.
I can't even commit to a social media director.
Why not? I'm just having a hard time finding someone who gets my brand, you know? Sexy? That's exactly right, you totally get me.
So, if you think of anybody who could be good for the job, let me know, all right? I will.
All right.
I'm headed to the airport now for another in a series of extravagant world tours all by myself.
At least I'll have the empty seat next to me that I always book for extra comfort.
I'll be at gate six.
I'm just saying this information out loud so I don't forget it.
Gate six.
Plane boards at 10:38.
Wait, Joey! Yeah? Um, here's your jacket back.
[chuckles.]
Thanks, Pickles.
Goodbye, Joey Pogo.
So Sarah Lynn.
That's okay.
We can spin this.
Yeah? What are we spinning? You went on a bender with her, at some point you split up and she died.
That's the story, right? If you want us to help you, you need to tell us what's coming.
You know what I thought? The first thing I thought when I heard Sarah Lynn died? Poor BoJack, that he had to find her like that.
That's right.
Poor BoJack, that's the angle! But then I kept thinking.
I wish I didn't, but my stupid brain kept thinking.
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah? And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand, you kept it in your glove compartment.
Diane I didn't wanna think about it, but I couldn't help but wonder.
Did you give it to her? I Uh Yes.
And then what? You just abandoned her? No, I You just left her alone, an addict, with heroin? I didn't leave her, I was with her! I was with her the whole time! I was with her when she died! Like "with her" with her? In the planetarium.
I left and came back and pretended I'd found her that way.
I I've never told anyone that.
That's really bad, BoJack.
Do the reporters know that? I don't know how they could.
I covered my tracks.
How did you "cover your tracks"? [knocking on door.]
[gasps.]
Oh.
Hey.
Uh, what's up? [Helena.]
We're doing end-of-year superlatives, and we thought it would be cool if you came out and read some.
Oh, um Just, uh, give me a minute.
[muffled chatter.]
This was supposed to be a celebration.
We can still figure this out.
I'm tired of trying to figure things out.
Let me just have this one night.
[sighs.]
[Helena.]
It's Horse Professor! [students laughing, cheering.]
Okay, okay, settle down, settle down.
Okay.
You wanted me to read these, right? Okay.
Um, well, for Best Old Man Terry.
[students cheering.]
[Terry.]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Sit down, Terry.
Just sit down.
Sit down.
If you start talking, then we'll all be old! [chuckles.]
For Best Director Oh, Horse Professor.
[chuckles.]
That's me.
[cheering.]
[Joshua.]
Speech! No, I Okay, okay, okay! Okay.
Thank you.
I just want to say that I've loved being here with you this year.
You've shown me the type of person I didn't know I wanted to be.
And this semester, I got to be that person.
Thank you.
And I just I want you all to appreciate this time, and how special it is, and how fast it'll all go away.
Please, cherish this.
And I have my own superlative to announce.
I, um [clears throat.]
Oh.
Uh, hmm For the Best Actor or Actress Oh, my God, it's an eight-way tie! [students cheering.]
[laughs.]
Okay, everyone.
Enjoy your party.
[chuckles.]
Hi, I just gotta tell you how much I'm loving the small plates and lazy Susans.
I put my fork down and I never know what I'm gonna pull back up! You've really made dinner fun again.
Uh-huh.
And did you notice my picture on the front of the menu? Uh, sure.
I mean that part I could take or leave, but the small plates and lazy Susans work together perfectly to form a completely new kind of upscale dining experience.
Exactly like dim sum, but with white people food, so it's more accessible.
Oh, well, thank you.
Huh! Tragic, isn't it? What is? I just keep thinking about Pickles and Pogo.
They've finally acknowledged that they love each other, but she's promised to another.
Yes.
To me.
Oh, right! So, you know better than anyone.
Someone's up to something, I can tell you that much.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, does your ex-wife regularly consume bagels? Hey, why don't you two mind your own business? How about that? As payrolled journalists, our business is minding your business.
I'm not going to help you with your take-down piece on BoJack.
Oh, no? He's a good guy.
And you have no idea how torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.
In fact, he was with her in the planetarium when she overdosed.
He actually gave her the heroin! Oh? Yeah.
He told me that once when he was drunk, and then he said, "I've never told anybody that.
" Because he's modest.
So why don't you just leave him alone? [huffs.]
Oh, Max, it's all coming together! I could just about kiss someone if I had someone here to kiss! Listen, I've been meaning to discuss The story? It's cooking now.
Smell that sizzle? We've gotta build on it.
More angles, more leads, more Whoa! [grunts.]
Oh My I You know, I think our story is about as wrapped up as a mummy.
What? I'd better hightail it to the office and put ink on paper.
But what about establishing a larger pattern of behavior? We still haven't heard back from the New Mexico girl or our contact at the rehabilitation clinic.
Don't you think we ought to keep working together? No, I think I ought to get married.
You were right all along, Banks, my boy.
The story is Sarah Lynn.
It always was.
Taxi! [horn honks.]
Wait! Paige! I, uh I love you! Oh, Max.
Of course you do.
Everybody does.
I'm Paige Sinclair! [tires screeching.]
So, what happens? When the story comes out, what do I do? A statement about how sorry you are about certain parts of the story but other parts of the story just aren't true.
No, you Then in everyone's head you've apologized for the really bad stuff without legally implicating yourself.
Does that work? All the time.
No, it doesn't.
Why are you telling him to lie? Because this is good.
This BoJack here is good.
This is working, but it's so precarious.
Well, I'm not gonna lose my job here, right? The Sarah Lynn stuff, that has nothing to do with this.
Right.
No.
You're about to get pushed out of a plane, and the two of you are talking like you're trying to brainstorm ways to get back on the plane.
That's not gonna happen.
You can try to find a parachute or you can dive headfirst into the earth, but the plane is gone.
You're seeing things in absolutes.
We can wriggle out of this.
Who's "we"? Diane, I'm asking you for help.
This job is my lifeline.
I think you should do the hard thing and be honest.
About everything.
Things will get worse before they get better, but you won't spend the rest of your life waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Yeah.
BoJack, just think [phone ringing.]
Wesleyan University Theater Department.
[Paige.]
Paige Sinclair, "Hollywoo Reporter.
" Is this a Mr.
BoJack Horseman? Y-yes.
Fabulous.
We're running a story Thursday next about your relationship with Sarah Lynn leading up to her death.
I wanted to give you a chance to respond to these allegations.
I presume you will deny them, as is customary, but this is me doing my due diligence and reaching out for comment, understood? Uh, yeah.
Now, did you supply Sarah Lynn with the drugs found on her person? No.
[Diane scoffs.]
All right.
And did you use heroin with Sarah Lynn during those last weeks? No.
Uh-huh.
Were you with her when she died? Um No.
And did you lie to the police about any of these things? No.
Thank you for your time.
[line disconnects.]
What happened to being honest? I didn't think it would happen so fast.
Did she say next Thursday? That gives us a week to plan.
We can minimize damage.
"We" are not doing anything.
Diane, please.
I can't be a part of this.
I have a book to write.
[grunts.]
Oh, my God! They're all making out out here! Go to your dorms! You have rooms! Well, we did it.
And by "it," I mean doing it.
Oh-ho! Fantastic.
So, now we're even, and everything can go back to normal.
I can't wait.
First step: let's set a date for the wedding.
Joey has a job opening on his tour that I think could be a real opportunity for me.
Oh.
Only thing is, I'd have to go tonight, and I might be gone for a while.
Oh.
Oh, Mister, I'm so confused! I feel like my brain is on a lazy Susan, just spinning in all directions.
And I know I should be ready to commit to a main course, but right now I'm just so excited about all the different small plates out there, you know? It sounds like maybe this is a bad time to have my face printed on the cover of your metaphorical menu.
What? Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that part of it.
Go on Joey's tour.
Have a good time.
And we'll plan the wedding when I get back? Sure, Pickles when you get back.
Sounds like a good compromise.
Yeah? Yeah.
The best.
Everyone gets what they want and no one had to compromise.
Oh, my God, I gotta go! Okay, I love you! Hey.
Thank you, for everything.
[kisses.]
[sighs.]
Hey! Sad Dog! [camera shutter clicks.]
I think the party's over.
[BoJack.]
Yeah.
What do you got? "My relationship with Sarah Lynn was complicated, as relationships between addicts often are.
However, certain aspects of the story are inaccurate or exaggerated.
This story has started an important conversation and I look forward to continuing to work on my own progress" There's There's no way to not sound like bullshit.
[sighs.]
Yeah, well This place was supposed to be a fresh start for me.
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start.
But no matter how many starts I get, there's always the same ending.
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.
I'm still here, BoJack.
Why? I don't know.
I'm a fool, I guess.
And you were my first client, and one time you were drunk and you smiled at me and I said, "What?" And you said, "I just like being in a room with you.
You make rooms good.
" You still do.
I have loved you for 25 years, and I never loved anyone better.
That kind of love, you only get it when you're young and stupid.
I'm not gonna get it again.
And when I tell my daughter the story of the great love of my life, I want it to have a happy ending.
Is it possible you letting me go is the happy ending? I've gone with you this far.
In for a penny, in for a pound, right? Sunk cost and all that? Yeah, sunk cost.
[sighs.]
The story's coming out Thursday.
I don't think that we can get around this, or over this, or try to get under it.
Diane is right.
We need to go through it.
BoJack I need to take responsibility.
I want to.
So you can tell your daughter you helped me do the right thing.
I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.
I'm looking forward to it.
You sure? I mean, no.
[laughs.]
[sighs.]
Shocking revelations today about BoJack Horseman's involvement in the overdose of Sarah Lynn, in an explosive new "Hollywoo Reporter" exposÃ©.
Is BoJack #canceled? # Find-out-tonight when the horse himself sits down On "Braxby Means Business with Biscuits Braxby," BoJack Horseman opens up in an exclusive interview.
For the first time ever, we'll hear the real story of the last days of Sarah Lynn.
I don't believe it.
I left shoe leather in six different states and spun the scoop of my career all to get sidetracked by a sit-down with a second-rate celebrity suck-up.
Relax.
Your story's clearly doing something if they're scrambling to do damage control so fast.
That's just it, Patience, my sister and lifelong confidante.
These schmoozey charlatans will pour syrup all over this stack of Shinola and try to tell you it's pancakes.
And I'm powerless to prevent it! Don't you have enough dirt for a whole other story? You know full well once I become Baxter's bride, I'm trading board rooms for bedrooms, watches for swatches and deadlines for bedtimes.
Okay, so then get married and forget about this BoJack story.
I mean, who cares, right? Patience, you cut to the core like a classic Sinclair.
I shall miss making mincemeat of the misdeeds of mischievous miscreants, but I must focus on my new mission, as I transition from miss to missus.
Why do you talk like that? We're from Fresno.
Huh, they're really hyping up this BoJack interview.
I gotta admit I'm kinda curious.
You're gonna watch, right? No.
I can't waste my energy getting worked up about that guy, Guy.
I've done enough of that.
Like, years of that.
Yeah, but it's not like you can just I need to work on my book.
These mall-related mysteries aren't gonna solve themselves.
Spoken like a very emotionally healthy woman, productive professional writer and super-cute girlfriend.
We already know what BoJack's gonna say.
He'll admit to everything in the story, but nothing else.
He'll trot out this sad-sack routine, everyone will feel bad for him.
He'll talk about his addictions.
"Showbiz is awful.
My parents were abusive.
" He'll say he's changed.
That he's not that guy anymore.
Yeah.
You sound real done with it.
I am! I'm just saying.
They'll make you feel bad for him, without it being too sad because too sad is a bring-down.
We wanna shoot for pensive.
And this will keep you from talking with your hands, which can be construed as aggressive.
And whatever you do, don't get defensive! Don't deny anything, and don't argue.
Give me a smile.
Uh Whoa! Am I my third favorite Bruce Springsteen song because I was not "Born in the USA" nor am I "Tougher Than the Rest," but I am "Blinded By the Light"! Nice smile, buddy.
Do you need to be here right now? Since your interview is leading into the season finale of "Birthday Dad," I wanted to officially welcome you to the MBN Thursday Night family.
Thank you.
And to ask if it wouldn't be too much trouble for you to shout out "Birthday Dad" during your interview? Why would I But only if the interview is going well.
If the interview is going poorly, please do not bring up "Birthday Dad.
" Hey, Princess Carolyn, I Oh.
BoJack.
Getting ready for the interview? Yeah.
Oh! You've got your work cut out for you, because people hate you right now.
I'm aware, thank you.
That story Wow.
Really well-written, huh? Yeah, the power of the prose was not the first thing I noticed.
Haunting.
Anyway, Princess Carolyn, is it cool if I take tomorrow night off for a date with Maude? Todd, I keep hearing about this new girlfriend of yours.
When do I meet her? You can probably take this part of the conversation elsewhere.
Right this way.
We should go on a double date with you and Pickles! Pickles and I are putting our relaysh on a brief hiate at the mo, but as soon as she returns from her work trip Uh, oh! Excuse me, I'm receiving a text message and it appears we have broken up forever.
You're gonna be great.
Yeah.
Where are we doing this? I got them to take the "Philbert" set out of storage.
Why? Because we want the intimacy and vulnerability of your home.
You're saying, "This is me.
No more lies.
" But since we're pre-taping it in the afternoon, we're using the set to make it look like it's nighttime.
Makes sense.
I'm here with BoJack Horseman in his actual house.
BoJack, a story came out this morning about the last days of Sarah Lynn.
How did it make you feel? Honestly? I felt relieved that now I can stop lying.
Are the allegations in the story true? They are.
Sarah Lynn was nine months sober.
I invited her on a bender.
We spiraled together for a little over a month and then she overdosed.
On heroin you purchased for her? Well, I didn't purchase it for her There's no need to get defensive.
I'm just trying to be accurate.
I-I didn't purchase it at all.
I just had it.
You just had heroin? Lying around.
No, no, no, no, not lying around.
You're making it sound like I had extra heroin, because I do so much heroin.
I had that heroin because I wasn't doing heroin.
So, I had it.
You understand? In your original statement to the police, you said she called you, you came to the planetarium and found her.
That was a lie.
Yes.
Would you say Sarah Lynn dying was your rock bottom? I don't believe in rock bottoms.
I've had a lot of what I thought were rock bottoms only to discover another rockier bottom underneath.
That sounds dangerous.
Eventually, I decided to stop waiting for something to change me.
I had to make the change myself.
And that's why I went to rehab.
And I'm very proud to be one year sober next month.
So, if I'm understanding you correctly, Sarah Lynn dying was part of that decision? Uh, it was part of it, yes.
Uh, I've made a lot of mistakes.
Can you share some of those other mistakes? I I don't think that it would be fair to the people who were affected by those mistakes, all of whom I've apologized to in private.
Now that you're sober, do you think you'll stop making these mistakes? I do.
It's been a lot of work, but I look back at that other BoJack and I think, "Who is that?" And who was he? I came from a broken home, and I used to feel like my whole life was an acting job.
Just doing an impression of the people I saw on television, which was just the projection of a bunch of equally screwed-up writers and actors.
I felt like a Xerox of a Xerox of a person, you know what I mean? But not anymore? No.
Now I feel like me.
It must have been difficult to see those same patterns repeat themselves with Sarah Lynn.
I think that's why her death was so scary for me, why I didn't wanna confront it, because she reminded me of myself.
Some have accused Sarah Lynn's mother of exploiting her death.
When you hear "All Twerk and No Play" in a Geico commercial, or see Sarah Lynn's face on a billboard with the slogan "I'd die for a Pepsi," how does that make you feel? Sad.
Angry.
Honestly, it feels like that's what killed her.
Not the heroin? No, you're right.
It was mostly the heroin.
If you could talk to her mother now, what would you say to her? I would say I wish you could know how sorry I am.
Am I crazy or did I nail that? It was good.
Oh, man, when she brought up Sarah Lynn's mother? She was setting me up to throw her under the bus, but then I said I'm sorry? I mean, that was a sweet move, yeah? I felt like I could see The Matrix! You've definitely gotten your 10,000 hours in when it comes to apologizing.
It was good, right? People are gonna like it? Yeah, well, we'll find out in three hours when it airs.
And that's why the band Chicago is not one of the top ten Chicago bands of all time.
Uh-huh.
Hmm, it's okay if you wanna watch.
All right? He's your friend, it's a big deal for him.
You don't have to be so weird about it.
I'm not being weird.
I'm in a good place.
I don't wanna get dragged back into that other stuff.
That's great! But, you know, it is a little weird that one of your best friends is a huge celebrity and you never wanna talk about him.
Roxy's really more my "best" best friend.
But you never talk about Roxy either! I don't understand what her job is and it's too late for me to ask.
And you were also married to a huge celebrity.
And you never talk about him either.
You don't share your past life with me.
You wanna talk about weird? I've lived here six months and I still haven't met your son.
Okay.
But you don't really wanna meet Sonny.
Of course I do! All right, cool.
Let's get dinner tomorrow.
"Tomorrow" tomorrow? Huh.
I saw your interview, BoJack.
As a recovering addict myself, I was spellbound! Wow.
I had no idea.
And I see no reason why you shouldn't return to Wesleyan.
Uh, small latte? My manager told me not to charge you.
What? He said he watched your interview last night, then turned off the TV and went straight to his first AA meeting.
Huh.
No "Birthday Dad.
" So, I nailed it.
You kidding? Pinky Penguin, line one.
Pinky! Princess Carolyn! You delivered MBN the best ratings we've seen in years! You just bought us six more months of not having to sell ourselves to a larger media company that strips us for office furniture.
BoJack and I were just talking about all the buzz.
I wanna strike while the iron is hot and do a part two tonight.
Part two? There is no part two.
It's right there in the title, "The Last Days of Sarah Lynn.
" Just sit down with Biscuits again and tell a few more colorful anecdotes from your years partying in Hollywoo.
Then, an encore presentation of the "Birthday Dad" finale.
Makes sense.
We got what we wanted out of this.
I don't think we should push it.
We're starting a dialogue.
I'm helping people.
Move over, Sad Dog.
Make room for Remorse Horse! That's great BoJack, but Listen, I'm ready to move on and go back to Connecticut, but it does feel good to be part of the conversation again.
And if my openness and candor about addiction is helping people, then I'm kind of a dick if I don't do another interview, right? I mean, I wasn't gonna say it.
Thank you so much for inviting us into your home for another night of questions.
Are you kidding? You couldn't keep me away! Because this is my house.
I wanna start with another Sarah Lynn question.
Oh, here we go.
Speaking of addicts, I think you're addicted to Sarah Lynn! You told the police you weren't with her when she died.
That she called you from the planetarium.
Yes, I lied.
Weren't you afraid the police would check the phone records? Oh! Well, I wasn't thinking clearly.
Guess I'm not a criminal mastermind! But the police did check the phone records, and your story checked out.
There was a two-minute phone call made from her phone to your phone, 17 minutes before you called 911.
Oh? If you were with her, how do you explain the phone call? I, um I called myself.
After I realized what had had happened, I took her phone and I called myself so I could make it look like she called me.
Why? I went into panic mode.
And then what did you do? I thought we were gonna talk about other stuff.
What did you do after you called your own phone, BoJack? I went outside to the parking lot.
And you just waited there for 17 minutes? Why are you asking about this? Biscuits Braxby.
Paige Sinclair.
You've been had.
A pleasure to meet you.
Had by who? The pleasure is mine, the pronoun is whom, and the whom is the horse.
BoJack? I got him to spill his guts about the worst moment of his life on national television for huge ratings.
Your disgusting display of soft-pedaling sycophancy made me wanna quit the journalism business altogether, two days prior to when I get married and quit the journalism business altogether.
But the Biscuits Braxby brand is keeping things light.
Celebs come on my show because I make 'em look good.
That access keeps me relevant.
But to what benefit is your relevance if it's squandered in the service of public relations? With the advent of social media, celebs don't need you to make them look good.
And if you don't alter your strategy soon, you'll have no career left to save.
Face it, chinchilla, you're all wet.
Well, I Ugh! Even if I wanted to do a hard-hitting interview, what would I say? I've a few ideas You keep looking over to your manager.
Well, I Can we talk about your relationship? Princess Carolyn? You dated her for seven years? Yes, and look! She's alive.
Did it ever get complicated, working with her while maintaining a sexual relationship? Well, she's always been good at keeping her personal and professional lives separate.
Quite an accomplished woman.
You said it.
She was an agent's assistant when I met her and now she's running her own company.
Plus, she's a great mom.
Oh, fish! Mom! I forgot about Todd's date! I can watch Ruthie for a few hours.
Thank you.
What can you tell me about Marcy Jerominek? Who? In the '90s, you had a fan club How do you know all this? Do you know where I'm going here? Marcy.
Yes.
She was the president of my fan club.
You slept with her.
We had a lovely evening together.
We both got something out of it, and Did you take a high school girl to her prom? That was a family friend.
Did you help a teen mom sneak out of rehab and take her to a high school party? I didn't take her.
We went together.
Is it true you once dated a woman who'd just woken up from a 30-year coma? Were you attracted to her naivetÃ©, too? What does all this have to with You had sex with the president of your fan club.
You had sex with your agent's assistant.
You party with underage girls.
You don't see a pattern here? It's not a pattern.
Do you enjoy having power over women? I don't even know what that means.
You don't know what it means to have power over women? I don't have power over anyone.
I barely have power over myself.
But you do have power over people.
And again and again, you abuse that power.
All these women that you mentioned, I never forced myself Not through force, but you understand the power differential.
So, I can't be with any woman I might have power over? Who does that leave me with? I'm just pointing out a series of You think everything is this nefarious scheme.
Most of the bad shit that happens in this world isn't because of wicked plots and machinations.
It's just because we're all a bunch of stupid, hungry, horny little goons just grabbing at shit, hoping it'll press that little button in our brain that says, "Okay, you're happy now.
" That's not an "abuse of power.
" Do you really believe you didn't have the power in all of those relationships? I I am an addict.
One of the first things that I had to accept was my own powerlessness.
But that's I understand what I did was wrong.
I'm not denying that.
But you're trying to paint this picture.
You're making it out like I'm a bad guy, and I'm not.
I'm not that guy you're saying I am.
So, back to Sarah Lynn No.
Why? You gave her the heroin I already told you, yes.
How many times can I say it? Breaking news! The thing I told you yesterday is still true.
Did you ever give Sarah Lynn alcohol? What? The first time Sarah Lynn ever got drunk, she was a child, and it was vodka, right? How how do you know about that? You were bringing vodka to the set of "Horsin' Around.
" Who told you all this stuff? Did Sharona tell you that? Doctor Champ, thank you for returning my call.
I didn't wanna say anything, but just watching BoJack in that interview, talking like he's a victim in all this.
If the world only knew the things I know I understand as a therapist, you're not at liberty to divulge what your client told you in confidence.
But I'm not a therapist.
I'm a therapy horse.
And I can tell you everything.
Oh.
Because Sharona was a drunk, too, so you can't trust a thing she says.
Obviously, she has a vendetta against me.
Besides, I already apologized to her.
Apologized for what? Okay, when you put it all together, it looks bad.
Do you see any connection between those other women and Sarah Lynn? There's no connection between anyone, that's what I keep saying! Sarah Lynn wasn't like those other girls.
I loved Sarah Lynn.
She was like a daughter to me.
I just keep seeing this story of you taking young women No.
Grooming them I didn't groom anyone, okay? It's not like I got Sarah Lynn drunk for the purpose of taking advantage of her.
She was ten! I didn't even have sex with her until she was 30! I'm sorry, what? No.
I just mean that Did you say you had sex with her? That was later.
She was an adult.
And we were both so drunk and high, I didn't We didn't know what we were doing.
We were addicts, and the thing about addicts This was during your bender? Yeah.
No! A different bender.
I took her to rehab, by the way! I tried to get her help.
I just keep thinking about those 17 minutes.
You waiting in the parking lot after she died.
But she wasn't actually dead yet.
She died in the hospital.
Right, but at the time, I didn't Ever wonder what would've happened if you didn't take those 17 minutes? Do you think she might still No! I Look, obviously when I did all that stuff, I wasn't So to recap, you gave Sarah Lynn alcohol when she was a child.
She then became an addict.
Come on, there was a lot of stuff in between I'm talking now.
You're not talking.
When she was intoxicated, you had sex with her, and when she was sober, you gave her the heroin that killed her.
Then in an effort to cover for yourself, you waited to call the paramedics that might have saved her life.
And you don't think you have any power over women.
So, it didn't go great.
The gross part is she doesn't even care.
This is just a ratings win she can use as leverage for her next big paycheck.
Maybe.
She was all over the place.
I think people are gonna see that she was just out to get me.
People are gonna see that, right? I guess we'll find out tonight.
Okay, maybe she had some good points, but she completely undermined herself with, like I mean, we dated for like seven years.
Do you think that I took advantage of you? I'm here, aren't I? And she kept bringing it back to women These "women I hurt" because that's what's hip now, right? Hurting women? But I have also hurt a lot of men! I told you to do just the one interview and go back to Connecticut.
But it's gonna be okay, right? You wanna grab some tacos? What do you think? I think you have three hours before this interview airs and your world changes completely.
You should think about how you wanna spend that time.
I'm going home to my daughter.
Sonny! It's great to finally meet you.
Hey.
Sonny! Come on! Good evening, ma'am.
Whoa! What's this? You made varsity? Yeah.
Coach moved me up for the rest of the season.
Wow! Congratulations! That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to wait for the jacket.
I'm so proud of you, buddy.
We should get Chicago-style cheese fries to celebrate.
Oh! I'll get I'm getting cheese fries.
So lacrosse.
What's your deal? What? My dad has a thing for broken women.
Then he nurses them back to health, and when they're better they leave.
You gonna leave him? Does your dad think I'm gonna leave him? It doesn't matter, because eventually my mom and dad are gonna get back together.
They're still in love.
What? No, they hate each other.
No, they don't.
They fight all the time.
Wha Really? Oh! Whoa! My dad hates my mom? Uh No! Of course not! Then why would you say that? You're so mean! I was gone for two minutes! Huh.
Ah.
Is this anything? "My girlfriend was upset I gave her a CD for Christmas.
But she gave me VD for Hanukkah!" That's nothing.
And possibly anti-Semitic.
Hold still.
Ugh! I am so ready to never do stand-up again.
Are you gonna put me on your TV show or what? I'm telling you, the network loves you.
They just need you to do a screen test.
It's basically a formality.
Screen test? What, you're too good for it? No, it's cool! A screen test! Ha! You wanna hit Alma's after the show? Best tacos in LA.
I keep telling you it's Neptune's Net.
Ugh! Malibu is for pretentious, rich douchebags.
That's Beverly Hills.
Malibu is for pretentious famous douchebags.
Hold still so I can finish.
Finish what? Look, you might never get a star on the Walk of Fame or a wax statue.
But this way you'll always be immortalized and undisturbed in Hollywood forever.
Unless they repaint.
Anybody from out of town? It's a trick question, it's LA.
Everybody's from out of town.
Most of Los Angeles isn't even in Los Angeles.
I mean, Azusa? Excusa? Oh, my God.
Hey, man.
I hated your show.
What? "Horsin' Around.
" Hated it.
Yeah, that's a hell of an opener.
But my baby brother loved it.
I'd be in my bedroom, sulking and I'd hear him laughing his ass off in the living room.
He had this great laugh.
Drugs took a lot from him, but he still had that laugh.
Right up to the end.
Now anytime I hear anything about that show, I hear my brother's laugh.
Thanks for that.
Well, shit.
You're welcome.
Hey, do you wanna go up? Oh, man.
I I haven't done stand-up in years.
You're famous.
They'll get a kick out of it even if you suck.
I don't think so.
Thanks, though.
Oh.
Mm-mm.
No.
Hmm.
Oh, what about this show? Oh, what's it about? It's really smart.
It's about New Orleans and jazz and Hurricane Katrina and drugs and John Goodman.
Sounds exciting.
It's not! Maude? I heard a man's voice! Yeah, Mom, Todd's over! Is that a burglar? He's my boyfriend! We're gonna watch TV! No shows about burglars, though! You got it, Mom! And keep the door open.
No funny business! Okay, Mom.
Wanna watch the second part of the BoJack interview? I don't know.
That guy was my best friend for like five years.
But not because we have anything in common.
I just landed at his house one night.
You ever get tired of living at the mercy of whoever happens to let you crash on their couch? What do you mean? Why don't you get your own place? Princess Carolyn doesn't need a live-in nanny anymore.
I think I'd get lonely.
How about this: what if you had your own place, but you shared it with someone? Like a roommate? Or a girlfriend.
But Maude, you're my girlfriend.
What am I supposed to do? Get a second girlfriend just to live with? No, I And by the way, you're one to talk.
You still live with your mom.
Yeah, I Why don't you get your own place? Right, that's actually what Wait.
I just got an incredible idea! Yeah? Because I just had an incredible idea, too.
Okay, let's both say our ideas at the same time.
One, two, three.
Salty gum.
Ice cream sandwich flavored ice cream.
Also, we should move in together.
Oh.
You know what they don't tell you about getting sober? The hardest part, worse than the DTs or the looking back at everything you did or the constant fear of relapse, the hardest part is figuring out what the hell to drink when you order a meal at a nice restaurant.
You expect me to order the bucatini carbonara at Gusto and then drink, what, an Arnold Palmer? I'm not even a red wine guy, but come on! "Here's your steak, sir.
Would you like an ice-cold Dr.
Pepper to go with that?" I mean Are you all right? Eh Hmm.
I guess what I'm getting at is I keep hearing you say, "That's not me.
I've changed.
" But how can we believe you've stopped this pattern of behavior if you won't acknowledge this pattern exists? I don't even know what pattern you're talking about.
I'll try one more time.
Over these last two nights, you've drawn us an outline of a person.
A person who doesn't think about others, a person who puts his own needs first.
And over and over, other people get hurt, not necessarily because he means to hurt them, but because he just doesn't care.
This person I'm describing, is it a different person, or is it you? Oh.
Yeah.
It's me.
[line ringing.]
[voicemail.]
Hey, it's Hollyhock.
Leave a message, if you're a hundred.
[beeps.]
Hey, Hollyhock.
Um, you still haven't returned my last call, which is fine.
I just I know you're going back to school soon, and you should know I won't be there.
Because of everything you've probably heard about.
So, if you were worried you'd have to see me, you won't.
But I would love to talk.
It's BoJack.
[beeps.]
[man.]
Welcome to Burritos and Mo! Home of burritos and much, much mo! Give me a large number three.
Oh, my God.
Ellie! Look at the monitor.
It's fricking BoJack Horseman.
Don't worry, I muted it.
[Ellie.]
He looks like crap.
Yeah.
His tie is all loosened up, which is like the universal sign for having a shitty day.
[Ellie.]
Probably because he just came from court.
It's all over the news.
He just settled with Sarah Lynn's family for five million dollars.
[man.]
Makes sense.
He seemed like a real psycho in that interview he did a few months back.
Yeah.
Guys.
[Ellie.]
I'm surprised he'd still wanna show his face in public.
Hey! [man.]
His face is everywhere.
The cover of every magazine.
Okay.
Even got the number-one slot for Hundred Most Hatted Men.
No, it [Ellie.]
Most Hatted Men? What is that? [man.]
List of men in hats, I guess.
He was wearing a fedora.
It was Most Hated Men! [Ellie gasps.]
[man.]
What? It was the Hundred Most Hated Men, it was a newsboy cap, and I can hear everything you've been saying! [Ellie.]
Uh [man.]
Get his bags, Ellie! You said you muted it! [BoJack grunting.]
[man.]
Have a burrito-ful day! [man 2.]
Hey! [grunts.]
You suck, asshole! [sighs.]
[theme music playing.]
[bleating.]
I don't think it's wise to be burning Bridges at this juncture.
I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.
Greetings, strangers! Maude? That's what they want you to think! I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus, we have never met before, and I'd be delighted to accept a job at this company.
[scoffs.]
What? As you know, I have 12 children.
What sort of day care services do you provide here? Has this ever happened to you? Todd? At the office? Can we wrap whatever this is up? I'm supposed to head over to the "Birthday Dad" set.
I wanna run a day care at VIM! I've mastered the art of looking at one baby and I'm ready for more.
You do have several employees with children.
If you employ Todd through the company, you could offer him a raise and still save money on taxes.
Great.
It's done.
Hooray! Corporate tax loophole! Plus, we can carpool to the office.
Which leads me to my next point.
I am moving out to live with Maude.
It's me! It's Maude.
I don't really have a twin sister.
Hey, that's fantastic! Where are you moving to? Um You can stay here! Live with me forever! [director.]
Cut! The line is, "Thank you for the birthday pizza.
Today, I am your dad.
" Oh, sorry! Let's take five? Hey, champ.
Everything okay? I'm just distracted.
Ever since Pickles left, I've been so lonely in that big, empty house.
I've always had a wife or a girlfriend, someone to take care of.
Princess Carolyn, you're perpetually alone.
How do you manage? One day at a time, buddy.
I went to the doctor to see if he could make me feel better, he said, "You should check out this Internet meme, it always cheers me up: Sad Dog.
" And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog.
" Guys, I'm really sorry this keeps happening.
When I got home, I found my wife and daughter had moved out.
All they left behind was this picture.
Okay.
Rude.
Shh! It's the stock photo that came in the frame.
My wife kept asking me to put in a picture of our family, but I was always too drunk.
But because of all of you and my sponsor Leo, I'm no longer just the man who's not in this picture.
I'm a different, better man who is also not in this picture.
Who's next? [sighs.]
Um, okay, I'll speak.
Ugh.
Things have been pretty brutal for me lately.
Most people hate me Mm-hmm.
I just lost five million dollars, so that's not great.
Could probably use a Leo of my own right about now.
Wow, tough room.
This AA meeting is a tough room.
[sighs.]
Hey, I'll be your sponsor.
Oh! Um I know what you're thinking, "Vance Waggoner? That guy's gonna be my sponsor? The guy Charlie Sheen once called 'a little much'?" Uh "Vance Waggoner? That guy's got more domestic assault convictions than Sean Penn!" And now you're thinking, "Did Sean Penn get convicted of domestic assault or was it just alleged? I gotta look that up later.
" I'm sure Now you're thinking, "Why would someone this cool and put-together wanna sponsor me, dumb slob BoJack Horseman?" That's not Wait.
I've been where you've been, BoJack.
And everyone abandoned me.
If you need someone to talk to, give me a call, okay? My number is 555-555-8008.
Because sometimes life turns you upside-down, and when you're upside-down, my number is boobs.
[phone buzzing.]
[beeps.]
Hello? Diane! How are the revisions going? Good! Usually at this stage I hate everything I've ever written and I feel like a worthless hack, but this book actually isn't terrible.
Great, so when can we expect the not-terrible sequel, "Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"? I don't know, Ivy Tran was fun but I'm a grown-up writer.
There are other things I wanna write.
Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt Interesting.
I didn't even tell you the thing.
I know.
I was interested in you not telling me.
Okay, good bit.
In the meantime, if you're interested in writing books that people actually read, you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two: Last Tran to Clarksville.
" Eleanor Roosevelt once Interesting! [disconnect tone.]
[audience laughing.]
[woman.]
And those congressional turd-weasels actually called this legislation the "Anti-Corruption Bill!" That's like if BoJack Horseman wore a T-shirt that said, "I am not a ginormous dick-weasel!" Hey, that is an unfair drive-by! Now, I know this Photoshop is not up to our program's usual standards, but in our graphic department's defense, none of them could spend ten minutes looking at this ass-weasel without their uteruses literally throwing up.
[phone ringing, buzzing.]
Ugh! [beeps.]
Yes? BoJack, it's your very good accountant Gaz.
I'm here with Your very good lawyer Chaz! Okay.
The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlement isn't gonna kill us.
What's the bad news? The bad news is you're being sued for a hundred million dollars.
What? Remember in your interview, when you disparagingly referred to yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"? The Xerox Corporation did not appreciate being implicated in your untoward behavior.
Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's death cost me five million dollars, but saying something bad about a brand is gonna cost me a hundred million? When you frame it that way, it almost seems comical! But it is not comical, because a hundred million dollars is a lot of money you do not have.
Okay, so what's the move? Funny you should mention "move.
" [doorbell rings.]
Your accountant told me you wanted to sell your house? Okay, I'm gonna call you back.
So, I sold your house! Wow-ee! It looks better than the pictures! You sold my house? Golly, are you? Sylvester Stallion.
From the Rocky movies.
Oh! Hey, you kids wanna go check out the pool? [boy.]
Yeah! [girl.]
I love my new life! You sold my house? I found this sweet, sweet family from Ohio whose kid just got cast in a movie! I wanted to make sure the ink dried on the mortgage before they find out the movie's being shot in Saskatchewan.
[chuckles.]
So, where do I go? What do I look like, a real estate agent? Wait.
Yeah? Your mail came.
Now leave.
You're harshing the buzz.
But Huh? Well, I'm all moved in.
[sighs.]
Me too.
Wow! Got a promotion and my own apartment all in the same day.
I never realized my boyfriend was butter.
You're right.
I am on a roll! What should I do next? [ringing.]
Chavez residence, this is Jorge.
Please state the purpose of your call so I can most appropriately modulate my tone.
Hey, it's Todd.
Is Mom there? Ah! Todd! Yes.
Oh.
She's resting at the moment.
Can I take a message? I just wanted her to know that I don't have anything to prove to her, but I got a new job and an apartment, so if I did have something to prove to her, I'd have proven it by now.
Well, that's wonderful, Todd.
Yes.
And quite mature.
And she won't even talk to me.
Does she know I'm butter? I'm glad to hear you're on a roll.
We'd love to see your home once you're settled.
What's that supposed to mean? I'm settled! I'm a grown-ass Todd! No, I just meant I don't need to impress you! Why don't you come to my fancy, sophisticated housewarming party tomorrow night and see for yourself! Consider us there.
What can we bring? Two chairs! [beeps.]
We could throw together a party, right? Um No.
I need a job.
There are no offers.
Can you check? Ask around? I'm checking.
I'm asking around.
[gasps.]
There are no offers.
But I'm broke and homeless.
[scoffs.]
I can get you a small role on "Birthday Dad.
" Great.
Have my pages delivered to me at the Chateau Marmoset.
You just said you're broke! And homeless.
You are not staying at a fancy hotel.
Who else would have me? You could stay here! Live with me forever! [sighs.]
[sizzling.]
[Mr.
Peanutbutter humming.]
And flip! Morning, sunshine! I hope I didn't wake you with the delicious smell of a well-balanced breakfast.
Less talky.
More coffee.
You got it, roomie! Coffee maker, make! [beeps.]
Took the liberty of doing your laundry and this letter was in your pocket.
[gasps, screams.]
Ooh-hoo! A mysterious pen pal! Is it a secret admirer or the snowman killer still at large? It's from Hollyhock.
But [sighs.]
I can't open it.
What if she says she never wants to hear from me again? Or maybe it says "I got rid of my TV three months ago.
What's new, BoJack?" I should just call her.
If I could talk to her, I feel like I could explain that [voicemail.]
Hey, it's Hollyhock.
Leave a message, if you're a hundred.
[voicemail beeps.]
Hey, Hollyhock.
It's me again.
And his good friend and roommate and coworker, Mr.
Peanutbutter! It's our first day of work together! I got your letter and I haven't read it yet, but I'm going to and It's really great to hear your voice your voicemail voice.
Just give me a call.
It's BoJack.
[beeps.]
Ready to go? What about this breakfast? We don't have time for that! You can feed me while I drive, let's go! Precision [Todd.]
Oh, whoa! Easy.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop! [kids giggling.]
Hey, Judah.
I need your advice.
I'm trying to throw a sophisticated adult party to impress my parents and I have no furniture or sophisticated adult friends.
I'm alarmed.
Do you not consider me a sophisticated adult or a friend? Judah, this is no time for one of your famous Judah tantrums! Sounds like you need to throw together a scheme in a short amount of time.
In situations like this, I often think, "What would Todd do?" And? He'd probably scour VIM's talent list for underemployed actors, tell them they've been hired for a site-specific immersive theater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers, invite just enough real friends to lend it an air of legitimacy and raid the "Birthday Dad" set for furniture.
That's brilliant! Todd, I've done it again! Let's go, babies! [giggling.]
Uh Babies.
Come on! [trunk trumpets.]
[giggling continues.]
War.
And for what? A couple trophies? A parade? [BoJack groans.]
No.
Not for me.
Maybe I'm just a crazy, old birthday person, but I think war is bad.
[bell rings.]
Great job, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You're changing hearts and minds.
Isn't this great? Working together? For the next take, can we get Dead Body Number Four to face away from the camera? Oh! That's you! Yeah.
Exciting! [grunts, groans.]
[director.]
All the way away from the camera.
[grunts, groans.]
[muffled.]
I can't really breathe.
That's okay.
Let's run it again.
[screams.]
Cool dressing room.
And great work on that scene.
You really seemed like a hollowed-out corpse.
Once animated by the fire of life, now consumed by horror and regret, and for what? Great.
You wanna get dinner? Oh, I'd love to, buddy, but I have like five more scenes to shoot.
Oh.
Of course, yeah.
I'll see you back at the house then? Yeah.
Oh! I'm probably going to head right to Todd's fancy party after work.
Todd's having a fancy party? Mr.
Peanutbutter, we're ready for the scene where you help an American soldier and a Taliban insurgent realize they both have the same birthday.
It's Christmas.
Ugh.
[line ringing.]
BoJack! [Todd.]
Greetings, cast! As you know, you have been hired to play urbane, civilized party guests.
So, if at any point tonight a "member of the audience" tries to talk to you, please say one of the three following phrases that elegant adults say all the time: "I'm starting to think smart phones are actually making us less connected.
" Oh, yeah! "Well, that's politics for you!" Or, "Sir, you cannot remove your shoes inside this Applebee's.
" [all.]
Ooh! Hey! Hello.
What's that? It's a case of Ass-Jolt, Pickles' favorite alcoholic energy drink.
I don't need them anymore.
Oh, fish, I forgot a gift.
You have two options.
This sourdough starter or a haiku I wrote on a grain of rice and then suspended in a bottle.
Uh Why don't we just say they're both from both of us? Yeah.
[woman gasps.]
Ugh.
And you don't wanna open it? I'm not ready.
As long as I don't read it, she's still in my life.
It's good to have people that remind us why we stay sober.
That's what my daughter is for me.
Here's your sandwich.
Chef made it just for you.
Hmph, hmph, hmph.
Okay, do I have a horn? Because everybody keeps looking at me like I'm some kind of freak.
Well, if you've got a horn, you're the ugliest unicorn I ever saw.
You'd be kicked out of the unicorn kingdom because you couldn't get a date to the marshmallow cotillion.
Yeah, or because I snorted up all the magic fairy glitter.
[deep voice.]
"This summer: Dumbass Unicorn.
" [chuckles.]
That's so stupid.
No, that's exactly what they'd do.
It would be like "Nasty Unicorn: The Unicorn Who Parties.
" [normal voice.]
Yeah, and his horn is like a corkscrew, and he tries to open a bottle of wine, but it gets stuck, so now he's got this wine bottle on his head, just dripping wine down his face, like [grunting.]
[laughing.]
"Nasty Unicorn.
He puts the 'U' in 'Eff you.
'" Okay, but it wouldn't be "Nasty Unicorn.
" It would be "Horny Unicorn"! Oh, shit, that's amazing.
Now we have to do it.
[chuckles.]
What do you mean "do it"? The movie.
You're the Horny Unicorn.
I'll direct.
We're doing it.
Yeah.
I'm not really the guy people wanna see in movies right now.
Yeah, they don't wanna see you be Secretariat or raising orphans.
But they will see you be a rude dude who says all the things polite society is too limp-dicked to say.
This is your way back in.
This is how you get that love back.
"The Horny Unicorn"? Yeah, 'cause deep down, he's wounded.
He's misunderstood.
It's not his fault he's the way he is! And people are gonna see that! Yeah? Yeah! He's like, "Hey, buddy! I never asked to be the horny unicorn! What? You think I like it that I gotta jizz rainbows every 20 minutes to keep my horn from going soft?" [chuckles.]
I don't know.
Come on.
I know you need the money.
When are you gonna stop punishing yourself? [video game noises.]
Flip it.
No, you gotta [sighs.]
Flip the thing.
Flip it.
Hey, Sonny, do you know where the advance copy of my book is? Your stupid book about the mall? Haven't seen it.
'Cause I would never even notice it.
'Cause it's for losers.
Girl losers.
[laughing.]
You can just say losers.
Girls can be losers without specifying that they're girls.
Will you let me know if you see it? I need to get revisions to my publisher.
[chuckles.]
Sounds like a "you" problem.
[sniggering.]
Girl loser.
[piano music playing.]
[indistinct chatter.]
Hello.
We're here for the party? We brought a plant.
Uh, just one sec.
I'm starting to think smart phones are actually making us less connected.
They are! Well, that's politics for you.
It is! Hey, man.
Uh What's going on? We're here for the party.
We brought a plant.
Look [sighs.]
BoJack, don't make me ask you to leave.
You don't have to Come on, dude.
Let us in.
This plant's heavy as tits.
I don't want a whole thing here.
My mom is coming and I haven't spoken to her in ten years, and I can't risk anything happening.
What do you think is going to "happen"? I don't know, man, but something always happens with you and usually I've been cool because I know you're always dealing with your own shit, but I can't risk it tonight.
I'm sober.
Nothing is going to happen.
Yeah, bro, what do you think's gonna Oh, shit.
Ugh! I'll see you around.
We spent like 30 bucks on that plant.
Yes, I have made mistakes.
So, now what? I'm just supposed to go away forever? I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.
This is where you find out who your real friends are.
Part of being sober is leaving behind all the people who can't stop seeing you as the person who pissed in the fountain at my own daughter's sweet 16.
Yeah? You think you owe them something because they tolerated you at your worst, but these people enjoy seeing you fail because it lets them feel superior.
They don't know how to process it when you're no longer the huge screw-up who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van to bring my friends to a strip club.
I don't know I do.
You know what else I know? You gotta go where the love is.
Yeah.
Maybe.
That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn.
" Because it's gonna make a billion dollars and drive all those assholes crazy! It would be good to have something to keep me busy.
See? That's what I'm talking about! There he is! There's my Horn-corn! [phone buzzing.]
Ah, shit.
My daughter's in trouble.
What is it? You mind if we swing by EWE.
S.
C.
real quick? EWE.
S.
C.
? I'm trying to keep a low profile.
I don't think a college campus BoJack, this is my daughter, okay? She's the one person I care about, the one thing keeping me sober.
Why do you need me to go with you? Unbelievable.
When everyone else abandoned you, who was there for you? When the world judged you and ridiculed you? And now, the one time I need something from you Okay.
I'm in.
Or as the horny unicorn would say, "Am I in?" Oh, you're in, baby! [video game noises.]
No.
No.
Come on, come on, come on! Come on! What the hell, Diane? Ah! I'm working! I'm just taking a break.
Oh, you found my book? Yeah, and it sucked.
Totally unrealistic.
You read my book? I've been reading it.
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it in front of my friends, because it's a book for girl babies, but anyways it didn't even make sense! What do you mean? Like, you say the book takes place in Chicago, but Ivy lives in Schaumburg.
Schaumburg, Diane? Schaumburg's not Chicago.
It's in the Chicago metropolitan Oh, my God, what's next?! Evanston, Chicago? Morton Grove, Chicago? Naperville, Chicago? That's what you sound like! Okay, it's not too late to change it.
Good.
And while you're at it, I've got some other questions.
Yeah? Like, okay.
When Ivy told Moose that he wasn't her best friend anymore and Moose said, "You're still my best friend whether you like it or not" [sniffs.]
was that real? What do you mean? Like, did that really happen, that someone could be someone's best friend still even when they're disappointed in them? Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real.
Okay.
And you know how Ivy kept her dad's watch in her locker because even though he wasn't around she still knew that he loved her? Was that real, too? Well, the book is fiction.
Yeah, no, I get it, I just parts of it felt real, you know? Yeah.
I know.
It's cool that you wrote a book.
I mean, I think girls are gonna like it.
Especially girls who, like, don't have good self-esteem.
I hope so.
So, when's the next one coming out? Just in case you need me to check it for other mistakes, you know.
[sniffs.]
Well, if I get started right away, it should be out by next fall.
Cool.
You gotta flip it.
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit! Jagger! Jagger! Shh, shh.
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down maybe? Oh, my God, Dad, is this seriously happening? Why are you here? You knew what you were doing when you liked your mother's Instagram post of her on the beach with her new boyfriend.
What? It was a good picture! That's why we're here? Every month, you get five Instagram likes on my account and five on your mother's account.
You heard what the judge mandated! Hey, man, let's just go.
Okay? People are starting to Are you BoJack Horseman? No.
Yeah, you are.
NoJack.
Were you trying to get my attention? 'Cause you got it now, baby! Dad! The story got picked up by TMZ! You're ruining my life! You're making me look like a real cuck, Jagger.
I'm getting cucked by my own daughter! You don't even know what that word means! I just want you to know, I think you got a real bum deal.
Oh, yeah? You got massively sandbagged in that interview, bro.
You were trying to apologize.
Thank you.
Everything these days is all "patriarchy" this and "male gaze" that.
And, well, I think it's cool you're pushing back against that.
Well, no, I'm not pushing back.
No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool.
You can relax here.
This is a safe space.
Okay.
You're embarrassing me! Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing? Your last spon-con post for L'OrÃ©al? It came off as disingenuous! [gasps.]
You know I love my wide array of L'OrÃ©al products! From game days with the gals to cram sessions at the creamery, L'OrÃ©al gives me the confidence to shine my brightest! Do you wanna come back to Delta House? I think those guys would be super-stoked to meet you.
They'd be stoked? Super-stoked.
All right, let's get out of here.
My daughter sucks, which is surprising because I did such a good job raising her.
Let's make one more stop.
Hey! Looking good! Well, that's politics for you! [phone buzzes, beeps.]
Hello? Your mother isn't feeling well.
She's still recovering from her surgery.
Oh.
Does that mean you're not coming to my refined, upscale party that I totally didn't just throw together only to impress you? I'm sorry, uh, no.
But thank you for inviting us.
Jorge, I'm trying to connect to her.
I know.
Please keep trying.
[beeps.]
I'm starting to think that smart phones are actually making us less connected.
And then I passed out in the pool.
Sploosh! Luckily, Lindsay Lohan was there to perform CPR.
She still credits me for being the reason she got sober that time.
[chuckles.]
Wow.
Who's Lindsay Lohan? She's a celebrity from the olden days.
Olden days? Jesus.
Hey, look, buddy, I gotta go.
I'm gonna walk this co-ed back to her room.
'Cause, you know, there's pervs out there.
Are you serious? You're supposed to be my sponsor.
So, what, I gotta hang out with you all the time? Relax, okay? I'll call you tomorrow, we'll set up "Horny Unicorn.
" Enjoy your people.
Okay.
[camera shutter clicks.]
Hey, man.
Hey! No pictures! Delete that.
Come on.
Hey, no.
You come on.
I'm not here to be your cool story later.
Okay, sorry.
I shouldn't be here.
[bottle clinks.]
[line ringing.]
[female voice.]
The number you are trying to reach has been disconnected.
Goodbye.
What? [gasps, exhales.]
Huh.
[sighs.]
[indistinct chatter.]
[camera shutter clicks.]
[camera shutter clicks.]
[camera shutters click.]
And that's the end of a sexist, fatphobic anecdote in which I was so desperate to get out of the rain, I slept with a plus-sized woman.
Hold the door.
Oh! Did I miss a meeting? No, Angela.
We took Davey here out for a big '90s-style birthday party, it being the '90s and all I would have come! I love the '90s, and it being them.
Come on, the president of the network shouldn't fraternize with the board.
Let your number two handle that stuff.
I don't like you going to birthday parties behind my back, Teddy.
I was doing reconnaissance for you! You didn't hear it from me, but there's some concern that as a single career gal, you're, well, a single career gal.
And? ABC's supposed to be a family network.
I understand families.
Uh-huh.
Does he? Oh, Herb.
I'm sorry, okay? It's called discretion, Herb.
We're trying to sell the network to Disney.
Disney? You think Michael Eisner gives a hoot who I go to bed with? We don't need to bring Eisner into this.
Obviously, Michael Eisner is a compassionate and progressive individual.
This isn't about him.
So, it's you.
Just say it's you.
No.
You're the one If you're going to fire me, at least have the balls to fire me.
You're fired.
Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think you can do "Horsin' Around" without me? We could do it without anybody.
All we need is the horse.
And that horse is just gonna go along with you canning his best friend? You want BoJack to betray me, you're gonna need one hell of a pitch.
Okay.
Mr.
Horseman, you're invited to set? Thank you.
The set of "Horny Unicorn"? Yes, I'm aware.
To shoot a scene in whichthe titular horny unicorn gets his penis stuck in a saxophone, because he was hoping to "get blown"? I know the scene, thank you.
Ah.
Hello? BoJack, this is Angela Diaz.
Huh? We met once before.
I remember.
I saw your interview several months back.
It made me nostalgic.
Me too.
Nostalgic for the day before I did the interview.
Oh, yes, humor.
If you're free tonight, you could come by the house, watch the fire, reminisce.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
What? Wouldn't you love to find out? Uh So, the Stephen King musical opened right next door to the Sondheim revival.
We have clients in both.
I was worried there'd be tension, but it turns out Misery loves Company.
Judah, are you in a band? Why do you ask that? I've always wondered if you were in a band ever since this afternoon when I overheard Juniper tell Stuart that you were in a band.
You're playing a gig tonight, and the whole office is going.
I was planning to invite you, but didn't want you to feel obligated.
We're not good.
Lenny! How the shell are you? I got trouble, PC! You know Teddy Buttons, my head of production? I'm familiar with Teddy.
I somehow missed that Teddy has spent the last 20 years showing women his I'm familiar.
See, that's why I love you.
You're discreet.
You're tough.
You're Teflon.
That's me, an old frying pan.
I could use someone who can handle the heat over here.
Someone who can be more professional and less Moonves.
What are you saying? I want you to run Turteltaub's new female-focused studio division, Girtletaub! I didn't sneeze.
No, Girtletaub is the studio.
I wanna announce a slate before the Teddy story hits the trades.
You think you can throw one together? You want me to pitch my dream movie studio? I need it tomorrow morning.
We gotta hit the ground running with this thing.
You don't wanna go slow and steady? What am I, a tortoise? Hmm.
Get me box office numbers.
We need firm financial figures to frame how fans flock to flicks that flex chicks, woman films, like Pretty, Wonder, Little.
Diary of a Mad Black.
I'll get my laptop.
Oh, wait! Your gig.
I have time.
This is important.
When a Man Loves a What? That's another film title, as we were discussing previously.
Oh, of course.
Mm.
Hey, Guy, I'm about to Diane.
Am I wearing a T-shirt right now that says "Treat me like I'm some kind of asshole"? I can't see you right now, but I'm guessing by your tone, no? Then why is my ex-wife treating me like I'm some kind of asshole? Did you tell her you weren't wearing the shirt? Lady got a job in Houston.
She's taking Sonny out of school and moving to Texas.
She can't do that! Well, she can, because she has full custody.
And this is her dream job, and I'm really happy for her.
But this sucks! Well, they must need cameramen in Houston, and I can write anywhere I couldn't ask you to do that.
I wouldn't ask you to ask.
If Sonny's going to Houston, then we're going.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Houston.
Uh, g-go, Astros! Go rodeos! Hope you like barbecue! I hope I don't need another abortion because they are hard to get there! Wait, what? Just trying to think of Texas things.
Sorry.
Houston! All day at the airport, I watch people pull suitcases.
Why do we suffer that extra weight dragging us down? Because we need clean clothes.
The point is: helium luggage.
Why pack light when you canpack lighter than air? All right, so Mom's too sick to come out of her room but not too sick to make her famous Frito pie? Well, she wanted to see you.
She was fine all day and then suddenly ill with a stomach bug.
I wanna see her.
No, no, no, no, she's not there! She's at the Zumba.
Is she at Zumba or is she sick? She is sick but was hoping the Afro-Latin fusion beats would make her feel better.
This was a mistake.
Hmm.
Todd, I must confess to you, your mother is not at Zumba.
I can see her in the window.
Oh! That's a mannequin so I can test out my outfits.
You're lying again! Okay.
She didn't come to dinner because she's ashamed.
She can't say hello? The woman has my kidney! And that's why she's ashamed.
A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.
If she could turn it around somehow, save your life But, alas, she cannot.
Huh.
But maybe if she could but no, youâre obviously healthy.
But if you weren't But you are.
Hmm.
Clearly there is nothing to be done.
Hmm.
Ugh.
Hey.
Wha Aren't you the horse from "Horsin' Around"? Mm.
Look at this thing.
I fell down one time and I'm an invalid.
Word to the wise, BoJack, don't get old.
I'll see what I can do about that.
My 40-year-old companion treats me like a fragile antique.
I've got a Lamborghini Miura and she won't even let me drive it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Anyway, I wanted to say I'm sorry.
Uh Yeah? I'm sorry that at the '94 upfronts we made you do that stupid BoJack dance.
Oh.
Is that why you wanted to see me tonight? No.
You're tall.
I need you to reach a box.
"Melanie, good luck with your braces.
I think they look cool.
" Huh? Mr.
Peanutbutter? Oh.
Uh Who's that dog? Mr.
Peanutbutter! Diane! You wrote a memoir? Oh, yeah! I had the idea a few months ago, then one weekend it just fell out of me.
What? From the way people talk about writing, I always assumed it was very difficult, but it turns out it's not at all, literally anyone can do it! Yes, that's always been my experience.
I loved your new book, by the way.
Thanks.
I'm happy for you, Diane.
Even though it's really easy to write a book, it's still an accomplishment to be proud of.
I am.
And how's Chicago? Are you a Chicagoan yet? You know, I went to school in Chicago.
You went to Northwestern.
That's not in Chicago.
Ah! You are a Chicagoan! I'm actually about to move to Houston.
In New York? Oh, I think there they pronounce it "Hose-town.
" No, Texas.
My boyfriend and I are going.
Oh, wow! Boyfriend.
Yeah.
That's fantastic.
I wanna hear all about him.
I assume he's a good guy? He's actually the best Guy.
His girlfriend looks nice.
He seems healthy.
What What's his job? I think he runs a daycare, but he talks about the babies as if they're his co-workers, so it's impossible to know for sure.
I should have been there.
We'll try again.
Oh! Hello? Listen up, Helen.
I've kidnapped your son and I demand a ransom or I will Next card? "Murder him!" Oh, no! Todd's gonna get murdered by a fearsome stranger whose sage, buttery voice simultaneously comforts me and fills me with dread.
Sounds like a lot of range for a kidnapper.
Who are you and what do you want? "I'm your worst nightmare and I want one hundred of your famous Frito pies." Yes.
Anything! "Under the Hyperion Street Bridge in one hour." That was perfect! Thank you, Margo! It's the least I can do.
Getting you to buy that addictive video game was the act that set me down this ruinous path so many years ago.
If I can make things right by you, maybe there's hope yet for this wretched soul.
Okay! Open it.
Whoa.
The studio went all-out.
They even found your original screen test.
That's incredible.
Too bad no one will ever see it.
After your interview, we couldn't give these things away.
Oh, right.
Sure.
It was a great show.
It would be a shame for it to be forgotten now.
Maybe it's for the best.
I just feel so bad for Sarah Lynn.
She was so good.
It's tragic she won't be remembered for it.
Well, nothing we can do about it now, right? I've completed a projection for female-led films over five years.
It's encouraging but vague until I get the specifics of your dream slate.
I don't know what that is! I don't remember my dreams.
Did I ever even have dreams? If you leave now, you can still make your show.
My job is to be here when you are.
No.
Don't give your whole life to this job, because if you do, someday someone will finally ask you what you want and you'll realize you don't even know anymore.
Okay.
I'm sorry to miss it.
You missing it will make eye contact easier tomorrow.
Gronkle has been re-cutting old episodes of The Cosby Show to take out all the Cosby scenes.
They call it "The Show.
" Huh.
They wanna try something similar with "Horsin' Around.
" So, it'll just be "Around"? It'll just be around eight minutes an episode, which is perfect for today's ADD-addled youth.
It's about three precocious orphans living without any adult supervision, who learn that wisdom and guidance can be found everywhere.
It's all "around.
" Well, sounds like you got it all figured out.
What do you need me for? Your backend.
Nobody's going to watch the show if they think you're still profiting off it.
I need that money now more than ever.
We want to buy you out.
A one-time payment and then you're divorced from the show forever.
Oof.
Do it for Sarah Lynn.
Doesn't she deserve more than to be remembered as the girl you killed? Have you seen the episodes without me in them? Mm-hmm.
And they're good? If you sign that document, you won't need to worry about that ever again.
Good, let's drink.
I'm fine with my water, thanks.
You're not fooling anyone with that water bottle.
Let me fix you a real drink.
One.
Wow, this is a huge crowd for us.
Is everyone from your office here? Not everyone.
Judah, obviously I was speaking figuratively.
Hi, we are Spectrum of Enchantment.
Our lead singer had to go back to work What? so we'll be playing all of the instrumental versions of our songs.
So Whoo! Instrumentals! Now boys and girls If you wanna do the BoJack Take your hands Put them up on your lower back Take your circle and strut and strut Wiggle your hips and jiggle your Uh-oh! Whoo! troubles and pull up your pants That's how you do the BoJack dance! Brilliant! Yeah, but no one wants to do the BoJack now.
It's funny.
I remember a time when I was scared you'd leave the show.
Who'd have thought one day I'd be asking you to? When were you scared that I'd leave the show? Oh, Herb was gay and I had to convince you to let us fire him.
Let you? You probably don't even remember, but I had this whole speech I practiced in the mirror.
I was terrified you were going to call my bluff.
Bluff? All this time, I thought there was nothing I could have done I guess I bluffed good! I'm not taking your stupid deal.
No! You signed! Stop, you idiot! No.
No! Why should I give you what you want? You took everything from me.
My job was on the line.
You have no idea Every stupid decision I made, every bad thing that has ever happened, it all started because of you.
Grow up.
You play these games, "if I hadn't done this, if I wasn't so that," but you did and you were and here we are.
I can't I Here we are! Because we did what we had to do.
So, what do you have to do now? Oh, God.
That's right.
Now, another drink? Please! Don't hurt him! Boy dies if you don't got the pies.
We have them.
Jorge? Go! Go! Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! We should have boxed them! No! Please don't hurt him.
I never got to make it right.
I've ruined my chance Spare me the deets.
I just want the freets.
Frito pies, that is.
Oh! No! Stop! Mom! Mom! Helen? Are you all right? It's okay.
It's not real.
I'm fine! It's a classic Todd shenanigan! But how would you know what that is? I think my wife is having a heart attack.
That's Margo Martindale, the actress! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I was too convincing! Oh, if only I wasn't so good at acting! It's funny, isn't it? The things that matter? The truth is none of it matters and the truth is it all matters tremendously.
It's a wonder any of us ever get out of bed at all.
And yet, we get out of bed.
I'm going home.
What are you doing? I'm taking your car.
What? You're not using it.
Someone should get some pleasure out of something in this sad, stupid world.
Consider it a signing bonus.
Ugh.
And I'm taking these.
But the lazy Susans turned out to be very problematic.
Why? Offensive to Susans.
There was a protest organized by Susan Sarandon.
Oh, no! Not that many Susans showed up.
You know what they say about Susans.
They're lazy? Suddenly you're desperately seeking them.
Anyway, I don't know how we got talking about me for so long.
You were gonna tell me about your boyfriend.
It's good? It's really good.
When I'm with him, I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know? Like, every other relationship, I always felt like a "me" in a relationship.
Does that make sense? Uh, yeah.
That makes sense.
Sorry.
I-I didn't realize I was doing that.
I've always tried to be an "us" with people even when I could see it wasn't a good idea.
Now that I'm single, I feel like I'm finally learning how to be a "me.
" That's great.
I know there were times you would try to tell me something and instead of listening, I just tried to fix it or convince you there wasn't a problem.
I shouldn't have done that.
We're all doing our best.
I wanna know now.
Know what? Tell me what it's like to be Diane.
Okay.
When you're Diane, you can live your whole life like it's a puzzle, put together from the pieces of different sets.
Like a crossover puzzle? Exactly.
Your whole life is full of these pieces that don't quite fit.
Sounds like a hard puzzle.
But at some point, you start to think it's you.
You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.
And you spend so long with that feeling that the feeling becomes your home.
And it can be jarring when you discover one day that you suddenly don't feel that way anymore.
At first, you don't trust it.
But then, gradually, you do.
I'm sorry.
That was a weird thing to be telling my ex-husband.
No.
I'm really happy for you, Diane.
It's funny.
I feel like if we met each other as the people we are now, things would be totally different with us.
Yeah, but if we hadn't met each other until now, we wouldn't be the people we are now.
Yeah.
Two equally accomplished book writers.
Uh-huh.
You suffered an anxiety attack.
I'd encourage you to avoid stressful situations like, uh, fake kidnappings under abandoned bridges.
Okay, paperwork time.
You seem like a fellow who enjoys unnecessary bureaucracy.
I do, Doctor.
Mm, was that the bridge where they shot Grease? Yeah! That's neat.
Todd, I'm so sorry! Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to I thought kicking you out was the right thing.
You were 18.
You had dropped out of high school.
You were always high.
You only wore flip-flops.
You never showered.
You don't have to list everything.
I wanted you to grow up, not leave forever.
Then more and more time passed and I didn't know how to make it right.
Truth is, I did grow up.
Your plan worked.
I haven't had a mom for so long, I I don't really need one anymore.
Oh.
So, what do we do now? Well, I do have one idea.
What? A big robot suit like in Aliens, but for babies so they can do grown-up things! That sounds dangerous.
Yeah, I guess it is.
But maybe the robots could be powered by energy generated from sucking on pacifiers.
That is so smart! Babies love sucking and right now it's just wasted energy! And so you see, the circle had become complete.
All the twists and turns had allbeen part of a beautiful tapestry, a grander mission to bring this boy and his mother together again.
That's quite a story.
But you've killed a lot of people.
Margo Martindale, you're going to pris Wait! You can't send her to jail before she gets to act in one of my movies! Indie filmmaker Nicole Holofcener? I find it hard to believe Margo Martindale has never appeared in your work.
It's true! And I need her to play the mother of the poetry student Catherine Keener has an affair with in my new film, "Classroom Warfare.
" Ooh! Can I, Mr.
Judge? Please? Damn, that does sound good.
Okay, you're free to go.
Yee-haw! Come on.
Open.
Open! Open up! God.
Where's my stupid Why is everything so difficult? Have it your way, door.
Todd! How come we never go swimming? This is terrible.
Well, hello.
Who put pills in my house? Judah, you were supposed to have the night off! Your hair is so long! I'd rather be here.
I know.
Would you think I was an idiot if I didn't go work for Turteltaub? I would never think you were an idiot.
This slate we're putting together We could get some financiers and do it ourselves, right? If there's one thing I know about this business, it's never underestimate what Princess Carolyn can do by herself.
Well, not all by myself.
Well I've got the babysitter 'til 11:00.
We might as well keep working, right? How can I help? Why don't you play me one of your songs? I strive for precision My aim is to be accurate and clear I don't say things I don't know to be true So believe me When I tell you I love you I don't write good love songs I'm not adept with metaphors or rhymes I just want to describe The things I know And the only thing I know Is that I love you Please believe me when I tell you I love you, Princess Carolyn.
Mm.
What are you so happy about? BoJack Horseman.
Six-foot-five.
All right.
Whenever you're ready.
A mustard sandwich? We may be orphans but leave us our dignity.
Uh, BJ, that's Ethan's line.
Oh, right.
Uh Orphans, huh? What am I supposed to feed you? All right, stop.
You're nervous.
Oh.
Forget the script.
Okay.
We're gonna do that movie that you're always making me watch.
You know You have to answer for the chimpanzee, Tino.
No, Mickey, you got it all wrong! So, where'd all the bananas go? The chimp's dead, Tino.
So's the bonobo.
Who you been monkeyin' around with? I can't do it anymore! It was the marmoset! Good.
Perfect.
Now look at the red dot.
Go! What am I supposed to feed you? I have mustard.
A mustard sandwich? We may be orphans but leave us our dignity.
Well, I can't fix you a martini.
Hey, wait! I have olives! Nope.
Not olives.
Perfect! Yeah? You, you think we got it? Buckle up, buddy, your life is about to start.
Ch-ka, ch-ka, ch-ka, ch-ka, ch-ka, ah Ch-ka, ch-ka, ch-ka, ch-ka, ch-ka BoJack Whoa, whoa, yeah! Hey Now, boys and girls If you wanna do the BoJack Take your hands And put them on your lower back Walk in a circle and strut and strut Wiggle your hips And jiggle your uh-oh! Push away your troubles And pull up your pants And that's how you do The BoJack dance! Hey
[birds chirping.]
[doorbell rings.]
What you got there? I think it's a hydrangea.
Does she even like that kind of plant? Probably not.
She doesn't like anything.
Hello, BoJack.
Thanks for having me, Mom.
You're the guest of honor.
Everyone, BoJack is here.
[Herb.]
Hey, buddy! Get in here! [Sarah Lynn giggles.]
For you.
Oh, a plant.
Dirt for inside.
Goody.
[sighs.]
[theme music playing.]
[dripping.]
You got here just in time, BoJack.
A bird flew in through the window and we're having trouble getting her out of the house.
[Sarah Lynn.]
Yeah, call yourself early and go get a worm! Golly, she's more coy than a coyote claiming a cottontail.
Ahem.
Phone for you, Mrs.
Horseman.
[grunting.]
Thank you, butler.
Is that Zach Braff? Who? Zach Braff.
Actor, independent filmmaker, real-life friend of Donald Faison? You mean my butler? At your service! I actually was friends with Donald in real life.
He's a spectacular man Butler! Sorry! Phone call for you.
I'll take it in the kitchen.
BoJack, make yourself useful for a change and help, will ya? With the bird? Hello? Oh, it's you.
All right.
That does it! [grunts.]
Son of a! With a drop like that, you'd think she was the ratings for Veronica's Closet when it moved to Mondays.
Ugh.
Comedy poison.
Who wants to laugh on a Monday? BJ! Finally made it to our little soirÃ©e, huh? Yeah, I kept having this dream where I was having dinner with all the people who were gone and I thought, "I should do that!" So, here I am.
We've got to flank her from the left.
[bird.]
Huh? Hello.
Crackerjack? That's what it says on my underpants! [giggles.]
[grunts.]
The uncle I never met and yet could never live up to! [grunts.]
All right, soldier.
Ready, aim [bird giggles.]
Huh? Hey! What's up, man? Hey, Corduroy.
[stammers.]
Good to Still weirded out because the last time you saw me I was naked, hanging from my iPhone charger, holding a lemon, with a very erect penis despite being deceased in my trailer for over an hour? Yep.
You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.
Hmm.
Mm.
Ooh.
What are you? Stop that.
Oh! Oh, sorry.
Forgot where I was for a second.
Think this'll help? Kid's got the right idea.
We can chuck the choker and spook her with this poker! Show her who's boss! [Sarah Lynn.]
Ruffle her feathers! [Corduroy.]
Get her to the kitchen! [grunting.]
And that! All right! [Herb.]
Go! [Crackerjack.]
Ha-cha! [Sarah Lynn cheers.]
[all whooping.]
Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.
Bully for him.
Speaking of useless, my husband is running late, so we're gonna start dinner without him.
He'll be here before the show starts, won't he? He'd better be.
In the meantime, let's adjourn to the dining room before our dinners get as cold as my parenting style.
[all laughing.]
[Sarah Lynn.]
I think mine would be the first time someone asked for my autograph.
Really? Oh, wow! I didn't even know how to write my name! I just drew a squiggle! Water? Thank you, Zach Braff.
You only get to give your first autograph once, you know.
The second time it becomes an obligation, the third time a chore.
But the first time [sighs.]
The first time [chuckles.]
Hey.
What is that? Ah, ah, ah.
Shh.
[BoJack.]
Mm.
Okay.
My turn.
Mine was also when I signed on a dotted line to enlist.
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song" in the big show later? No, Mom.
You know I never make it to the show.
I didn't know then that enlisting would lead to my two worst parts.
You have two? I didn't know we could pick two.
Corduroy, it's a conversation, not an assignment.
[Corduroy.]
In that case, I have three.
[Herb.]
Three is way too many.
My worst parts were saying goodbye to my mother and seeing a bullet go straight through my general's face, right before it hit my own.
[all gasp.]
At least your death was instantaneous.
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV from when I had cancer.
Drip.
Drip.
Ooh.
[Corduroy.]
What about you, BoJack? What? Best part, worst part, what about you? Well, I guess my worst part has to be, um Right before I got here, I think? Uh I went to Angela Diaz's house.
[gulps, spits.]
Ugh! Does anyone else's water taste like chlorine? Hey, Braff, can I get some different water over here? Right away, Mr.
Horseman.
Crackerjack, do you think your death meant something because it was in the service of a greater cause? Aw, shucks.
Of course it meant something.
I think questions like that are too big for a little soldier like me.
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.
Because sometimes I wonder But see, this is where I get hung up, because when we valorize the idea of sacrifice, of loss, of suffering BoJack, don't start with this again.
When we grow up in a house that does that, we internalize this idea that being happy is a selfish act, but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.
[Sarah Lynn.]
Yes, it does.
Sacrifice? In the service of something greater, maybe, but just in and of itself? What's the good in that? A lot.
Sacrifice is good.
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton, and I was freaking awesome.
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice? I gave everything.
I gave my whole life.
You died in a hedonistic bender.
I'm not talking about my death.
I'm talking about my life.
I gave my whole life.
If we get into everyone's whole life, we're gonna be here all night.
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part," not "Everything That Ever Happened.
" Okay, worst part: the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour.
" My manager leaked nudes to get more tour dates added, my mom pointed out every carb I ate, it was hell.
But it gave millions of fans a show they will never forget.
And that is worth something.
No, that's a high you chase.
It was not.
You think you singing songs on stage is the same thing as this guy who died liberating the camps? We don't need to compare apples to Auschwitzes.
Herb, tell 'em.
It means something the work we do, the joy we bring.
It has to, right? Boy, I sure thought so.
I-I used to really believe in it.
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport during a snowstorm on the eve of the dance championship guest starring Gregory Hines" episode away from an Emmy.
Then I lost it all.
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing this leak? Fine, we'll get a bucket.
The drips are hitting me! Then you'll hold the bucket.
But the funny thing is, it wasn't until I got fired that I actually became myself.
I was out of the closet.
I was free.
I was authentically me.
What does being authentic have to do with anything? Well, when I wasn't hiding behind some facade, I could be at peace.
That's when I really got into philanthropy.
Can I ask you something, Herb? Why do people say that? If you're asking it, then yes, you can and you will and you just did.
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions? Yeah, what are these questions, royalty? [imitates fanfare.]
Announcing King and Queen Query of the Interrogative Isle.
May I ask you how do you do? Very well, thanks.
Ah, bup, bup, bup! I didn't ask you yet.
I asked if I could ask you.
Did you get pleasure from your charity work? Like real, deep pleasure? It dwarfed every other joy in my life.
Doesn't count then.
If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.
And it's only good if it's selfless.
Who made up that rule? I helped people.
Who cares if it made me feel good, too? Feeling good is inherently selfish.
If I'd given myself to Christ, truly went down the path I don't care for this talk of religion in my house.
If I wasn't constantly trying to feel good, get it better, always looking for maximum pleasure [sighs.]
That was my worst part.
Well, one of the three worst parts.
Wait, actually, can I have four? Discovering you in your trailer definitely cracks my top five.
This is bullshit! I did a lot for a lot of people! I was not a bad person.
No one is accusing you of being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.
[yelling.]
You are! You all are with your "being authentic" and "charity work" and "killing Nazis.
" I actually never killed a Nazi.
All my kills were friendly fire.
I also never liberated any camps.
I'm honestly not sure what I did.
Here you go.
Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.
Wait, Dad's here? He's never made it to dinner before.
Hey, here's a question.
Another question has arrived! Did any of you have a song of yours played in outer space? Anyone? No.
Just me? Oh.
That's what I thought.
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)" is making its way to Mars! That means something.
I will be remembered.
That has to mean something.
I will be [door opens.]
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss the show? Hey! There he is! There's our guy! Dad! I Oh, you didn't miss a thing.
It's not like we have anywhere to be.
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves to your schedule? I already apologized.
I was running.
Yes.
As always, running late, while I was running myself ragged trying to get dinner on the table.
[clears throat.]
Yes, you helped.
And now I'm running out of patience for you running your mouth.
And I'm running out the clock until we both Well.
Here we are.
I'll just squeeze in here.
Get yourself something nice.
Ooh! Thank you, Mr.
Secretariat.
What'd I miss? We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.
Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.
When I left "Horsin' Around," I honestly thought about killing myself.
Shit, Herb.
Really? Yeah.
But the Knicks were having a good season and I wanted to see what happened.
Wait, you didn't kill yourself because the Knicks were having a good season? What would you have done if they were having a bad season? I don't know.
Gotten into baseball? Oh, for the love Where's your follow-through? It's like you didn't even wanna kill yourself! And I'm so glad I didn't.
Because there I was ten years later at Machu Picchu and I realized there was so much more I could do in a life.
Okay, my turn.
August 22nd, 1973, I was banned from running ever again.
And running, well, that was the only thing that ever made sense to me, so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.
[coughing.]
This is your worst part? Best part: jumping off that bridge.
Jesus.
What did I say about the Jesus talk? It was my choice.
I got to go on my own terms.
Not a lot of people can say that.
No.
That's true.
The view from up there.
Eh, you wouldn't believe it.
[coughs.]
[all laughing.]
Oh, my.
It must've been from swimming earlier.
Oh, you were swimming? Yeah.
I, um [clears throat.]
When was I swimming? Don't think about that.
Do you have a best part? Oh, uh, I don't know.
This past year I took a teaching job.
And I had this one student who was really struggling, just couldn't get over this hump.
And what, you helped him do good in a scene? For your class? That's the best part of your whole life? I don't know, I was just spitballing.
I didn't know you were gonna put me on the spot like this! Come on, buddy.
What was so special about that moment? It felt good to help someone do something.
See? Helping someone, like I said! But he liked it because it felt good, like I said! I liked it because it reminded me of when I was young, just starting out.
You and me, screwing around, hitting up open mics.
Trying to figure it out.
I think I think that was the best part.
Really? Well, are we ready to start the show? [Corduroy.]
Let's do this! Okay, nice seeing you all! You're not coming? This is always the part where I wake up.
You all go to the show.
Zach Braff says "Pardon my reach" even though he can clearly get my plate from another angle.
Then I wake up.
Oh, okay.
Next time then.
[sighs.]
[dripping.]
Pardon my reach.
Hmm.
[Herb.]
Hello, everyone! Please take your seats.
Tonight's show is in honor of BoJack Horseman! What do you say, huh? Should we get this show started? Yeah! Tonight's opener needs no introduction, but I'm gonna give her one anyway.
Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sarah Lynn! [audience cheers, applauds.]
Thank you, thank you! I'd like to dedicate tonight's performance to the man of the hour, BoJack Horseman! Sarah Lynn, I'm so sorry for everything that happened with you.
With us.
I should have protected you Ah, ah, ah.
BoJack.
This is my time.
Yes.
Of course.
Sorry.
[knuckles crack.]
[clears throat.]
Life is a never-ending show, old sport Except the minor detail that it ends The overture's a lifetime But the show is short Here with all your family and friends You run the race You blurt your lines They put your face On shirts and shrines And giant signs a thousand feet tall And don't stop dancing Don't stop dancing 'Til the curtain call Shows are a never-ending life Of course A silhouette that stays When you are gone What use is the struggle And the strife, old horse? End it and your legacy lives on The chatter stops The crowd departs A needle drops, the music starts A song you taught me when I was small Don't stop dancing Don't stop dancing [inhales.]
[squelches.]
[audience cheering.]
Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn! Okay, performing an interpretive aerial routine, your friend and mine, and a killer hang [audience laughs.]
Corduroy Jackson-Jackson! Where did Sarah Lynn go? Shh.
Try to enjoy the show.
[grunts.]
Ha! Where does this door go? Sit down, buddy.
You'll get your turn.
No, I need you to tell me What? Watch out! [BoJack grunts.]
[Corduroy grunts.]
[drumroll.]
[audience cheers.]
That's a series wrap on Corduroy Jackson-Jackson! Down in front, please? All right, let's keep this show going, huh? Next up, you know him, you love him, please a give a warm, warm, burning hot welcome to Hey.
You wanna grab a smoke? Zach Braff! Yes.
Yeah, let's get out of here.
[audience cheering.]
[Zach.]
Oh-ho, whee! I'm honored.
Honored, honored.
So, what's on the other side of that door? The nerve of that guy.
With the beard.
Herb? Yeah.
Herb.
What, he says he's at peace? 'Cause why, Machu Picchu? I don't buy it.
I don't know.
I I believe him.
I promise you, every single person in that room would go back if we could.
Peace? That's someone trying to convince himself of something.
Of what? That life has meaning or purpose, that that if you check the right boxes and do the dance, then you get a little parting gift at the end, a framed certificate that says, "Congratulations, you've got peace.
" [chuckles.]
I wouldn't mind that.
But guess what? All the time those people spent, trying to do good or help people or be something? I did none of that shit, and yet here I am, same as them.
You were the fastest runner in the world.
You inspired millions.
And yet, here I am, same as you.
So, if you could go back, do it again, what would you do different? [sighs.]
What would I do? I wouldn't have cared so much.
Cared about what? Racing? About everything.
I know this part is confusing because I'm Secretariat and also your dad for some reason, but speaking as your dad, it's important that you know that I cared.
No.
You never cared.
You cared about your book.
You cared about getting drunk and telling everyone how miserable you were, but that's not caring.
You think I didn't care because I put up walls, but I cared so much, BoJack.
About you, about your mother.
I wanted you to respect me.
I wanted you to love me.
I was so afraid that you would know that.
I cared so much.
It's a shame that we could never talk like this in real life.
All the good it would have done.
Least we got the chance this time, before I wake up.
[chuckles.]
Wake up? Oh, you're not getting it, are you? Getting what? Loss is a collaborative art, between the people who leave us and those who remain.
We dance with the shadows of their absence.
With that in mind, I present to you [grunts.]
Stop the show! Excuse me.
What's happening? You're being very rude.
I was about to do my roller-dance routine.
Calm down, son.
Yes, why don't you sit down, and No! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no.
Please! I'm not ready.
I never got to direct my Backdraft remake: "Zach Braff's Backdraft"! I never finished my memoir: "I Started A Zach Which Started The Whole World Braffing!" I never got to license the Zach Braff Short Stack Breakfast Attack at Shake Shack! Cash-strapped hash brown fans who hashtag "Zach's snacks" get cash back fast with the Braff Bucks app! I need to wake up.
I can't be here.
Of course.
Everything's always about you.
BJ, buddy Herb! How did I get here? How the hell should I know? I broke into my house.
But it wasn't my house anymore.
I was I was watching the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.
Yes.
Yeah, and I drank some more and I found some pills.
And then I went swimming No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait! I got out of the pool.
Yes! And I called Diane! BoJack, we're trying to do a show here.
But I called Diane.
I couldn't have drowned if I got out of the pool to call Diane! So, I shouldn't be here.
[stammers.]
If I could just finish the conversation.
Where's a phone?! [pants.]
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a real treat for you next.
A real treat.
Come and see him before he makes a run for it.
No! Stop! It's Secretariat! Stay calm.
Flyin' off the handle won't change a thing.
This was gonna happen to you one of these days.
A poem.
Original, obviously.
It's called "The View from Halfway Down.
" [clears throat.]
"The weak breeze whispers nothing The water screams sublime His feet shift teeter-totter Deep breath, stand back, it's time Toes untouch the overpass Soon he's water bound Eyes locked shut but peek to see The view from halfway down" [audience applauds, cheers.]
I'm not done.
Hold on.
I'm not done.
I'm not done.
[clears throat.]
"A little wind, a summer sun A river rich and regal A flood of fond endorphins Brings a calm that knows no equal You're flying now You see things much more clear Than from the ground It's all okay, it would be Were you not now halfway down Thrash to break from gravity What now could slow the drop? All I'd give for toes to touch The safety back at top" I change my mind.
[stammers.]
I change my mind.
I don't wanna It's okay.
"But this is it, the deed is done Silence drowns the sound Before I leaped I should have seen The view from halfway down No! I really should have thought About the view from halfway down" Find your peace, big guy.
Find it.
"I wish I could have known About the view from halfway down" [BoJack gasps.]
I need to get out of here! Wha BJ, where do you think you're going? Nothing you do in here matters, pal.
Yelling and struggling isn't gonna pull your body out of that pool, so you might as well just Sit down! [echoes.]
But I Look, BJ, it's possible that someone is going to find you and save you, and it's also possible that someone won't.
We don't get to know.
Can I ask you a question? [imitates fanfare.]
Has anyone ever come back from this place? [sighs.]
[mic feedback.]
BJ, there is no place.
It's just your brain going through what it feels like it has to go through.
All you can do right now is sit back and enjoy the show.
[sighs.]
Folks, here is Beatrice Horseman with her younger older brother, Crackerjack! [audience applauds.]
[organ plays.]
[trumpet playing.]
[Beatrice hums.]
Hoo! [BoJack exhales.]
This is the hard part.
[grunts.]
Golly.
And now the easy part.
Over and out! [grunts.]
[squelching.]
[audience cheering.]
Wow.
Beatrice Horseman, huh? You know, she was gonna sing for us tonight, but apparently, she was a little "horse.
" [chuckles.]
Okay.
You ready for the headliner? [audience cheering.]
No.
Please welcome to the stage [drumroll.]
No.
Please.
The star of "Horsin' Around" and "The BoJack Horseman Show"! "Philbert"! "Secretariat"! The upcoming "Horny Unicorn"! Son of Butterscotch and Beatrice! Husband to no one! Father to none, that we know of! [chuckles.]
Stand-up comedian, actor, crippling alcoholic! A talented charmer and a stupid piece of shit.
It's BoJack Horseman! Is it terrifying? No.
I don't think so.
It's the way it is, you know? Everything must come to an end, the drip finally stops.
See you on the other side.
Oh, BoJack, no, there is no other side.
This is it.
[audience applauds, cheers.]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[mic feedback.]
I I need to make a phone call.
[squelching.]
[indistinct chatter.]
Hello? Someone? Anyone? [pants, yells.]
[gasps.]
[stammers.]
I'm looking for a phone.
[screams.]
[grunting.]
[screams.]
Diane! Diane! Are you there? Diane! I need you! [Diane.]
BoJack? Diane! Thank God! Thank God, Diane.
Okay, Diane.
Diane, you're gonna save me, right? I called you and you're coming to get me? BoJack, why did you call me? I live in Chicago.
I can't save you.
You didn't pick up.
Right.
It went to voicemail.
Yeah.
And then I went back in the pool.
[squelching.]
It's too late.
What's done is done.
No.
There's nothing I can do, BoJack.
I'm not real.
None of this is.
So, what do I do now? BoJack, it doesn't matter.
Well, if it doesn't matter, can I stay on the phone with you at least? Okay.
How was your day? Good.
Yeah? Yeah.
My day was good.
[heart monitor blares.]
[heart monitor beeping.]
I'm running through the pages And they start to turn In love with the life I had Not the one I've got Tell me I'm the good guy I wanna come in first Here is celebrity at its worst So why the long face? 'Cause I don't wanna live here In this sunny place Runnin' from my time So why the long face? Because I've been losing I really could use you on my side So why the long face? So why the long face? So why the long face? So why the long face? Look, nothing's easy.
But I wouldn't be talking to you now if I didn't believe that it wasn't too late for us.
So what are we doing here? I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm here to put on the best goddamn production of Hedda Gabler this supermax prison has ever seen! So let's take it back to Mrs.
Elvsted's entrance, and remember, if you're on stage, I can see you, you're in character, you have an opinion about the return of Ejlert LÃ¸vborg.
Oh, shit, is it 10:30 already? Okay, look, guys, I gotta go, but I'll be back tomorrow and we'll pick up rehearsals Monday.
If everyone could be off-book by then, that would be phenomenal.
Schlesinger, if you have time to fashion a shiv and organize a jump on the rats in Block C, you have time to learn your lines, 'kay? Priorities.
There he is! Uh-oh! America's most wanted over here, huh? Thanks for picking me up.
The jury finds you guilty of being a super-cool dude, am I right? You're extremely clever, can we go? I sentence you to life filled with my friendship! If this is my only other option, I choose prison.
So you were just planning on wearing this to the wedding? Really leaning on that "optional" in black tie optional.
These are the clothes I went in with.
I didn't know I'd be going to a wedding in a year.
That's why you always gotta pack a spare suit, just in case.
What are you in for again? Officially, breaking and entering, but I think it was kind of for everything.
Ah, a little bit of everything.
Like the varied cuisine at your favorite small plate lazy Susan restaurant, right? Pardon? Do you have a favorite establishment of that sort? A favorite small plate lazy Susan restaurant? Hell if I know.
BoJack, it means so much that you would say that.
I actually am a little hungry.
Where could we get lunch around here? Elefino! No? Oh, how about the diner? So, do you spend a lot of time with them, as a couple? Well, I see Princess Carolyn a lot at "Birthday Dad" events.
Emmys, Golden Globes, Critic's Choice Awards, Peabody Awards.
The Nobel Prize for Television they created just for our show.
But Judah usually stays home with Ruthie.
I can't believe she's getting married.
Thought it would be with you, huh? I thought it would be with nobody because I wasted all her best years.
Turns out her best years are now.
Well, joke's on me.
I couldn't even waste the right years.
I'm shocked she could get me out for the weekend.
When are you getting out for real? Few months.
Wow.
What are you gonna do next? Big plans post-big house? Big Momma's House reboot? Reboot of the franchise Big Momma's House, starring you? My main goal right now is just not screwing up this weekend.
You won't screw it up.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
Mm.
Can you get me another suit? You think Diane's gonna be there? Everyone's going to be there.
It's the party of the year.
I haven't talked to Diane since, uh What about you? Are you seeing anyone? Oh, I'm too busy with my show.
Those birthdays aren't gonna dad themselves! What is this show? Besides, I'm really trying to focus on myself right now.
I had this breakthrough recently.
One day, in therapy, I just blurted out, "Is my problem with women any movie directed by Christopher Nolan? Because, yes, women are involved, but it's really never about the women.
It's about me.
" That's actually somewhat astute.
It occurred to me: Are my self-destructive patterns and unexamined cycles of co-dependency the popular Jim Carrey character The Mask? Because "somebody stop me"! Are all of your breakthroughs phrased like that? Um, are all of my breakthroughs a British prog-rock band from the '70s? Because yes.
Ugh! W-What are we doing here? Is this where the wedding is? I just have to make a real quick stop.
At the Griffith Observatory? I have a press event.
You took me to a press event? It was on the way.
Ah! No.
What do you I can't be here.
It'll take 15 minutes, 20 tops.
Definitely not more than two and a half hours.
Hello, everybody! You all know and love me as the titular Birthday Dad.
I've also been known for other roles: Sad Dog, fracking advocate, finder-outer of what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know and whether they know things, but some of you might remember me as the notorious Stealer of the "D"! Ooh! Now, to celebrate the success of "Birthday Dad," I thought it was time I gave a birthday present back! I called up my favorite sign company and said, "I wanna give this whole town the 'D'! 'D' for Dad.
'Birthday Dad, ' that is!" Yay! So, without further a-dad, let's say goodbye to the era of Hollywoo forever, and say hello to Holly woob? Huh? No, I said "D" as in "Birthday Dad.
" No, obviously I meant the "Dad" part of "Birthday Dad," I assumed that went without saying.
Look, I gotta go, but the next time I need a sign made I'm going to strongly consider going with a different company.
Okay, next stop: wedding! I'm not ready for this.
You gotta take me back to jail.
What? Come on, Shawshank, you're gonna be fine.
No, I can't be around people.
I can't face them, I'm not ready.
What do you think is gonna happen? I don't know! I never know.
I just know that something bad is gonna happen if I go to that wedding.
How about this? We'll go to the wedding and if you get there and you wanna leave, we can leave.
Yeah? Yeah.
And if you wanna stay, I'll stay there with you.
I will not leave your side.
You sure? Of course.
I'm here for you, buddy.
No matter what.
Unless I see my good friend Erica and get distracted by some noteworthy aspect of her character or presentation, but, BoJack, what are the odds that would No more lonely nights Ugh.
Wishes do come true Hmm.
Huh.
BoJack! Thank God I found you! What? What is it? The fireworks are going to start in ten minutes.
There's no time to explain.
We need to go down to the beach so I can sit on your shoulders! What? Why? I just said there's no time to explain! Did you go to jail for being a bad listener? Come on, we gotta go! Okay.
Whoa! Ho-oh! Oh, wow! That's like a 3-D one! So why did we need to be on the beach? Oh, you just seemed really overwhelmed at the party.
I thought you could use some air.
Oh.
Thanks.
But then why are you on my shoulders? So I could get a better view of the fireworks.
Okay, get down.
Oh, okay.
It's good to see you.
How'd you get out of the supermax? Did a helicopter crash into the side of the building and then you just walked out? What? No.
I'm just here for the wedding.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Oh, bummer.
No, it's good.
I think the routine is good for me.
I'm staying out of trouble, at least.
Hooray! Staying out of trouble, at least! I'm trying to set little goals for myself.
Like, in a couple months, I'll beat my record for being sober.
Nice! Yeah, so that's that's something to aim for, but then, uh, after that, um After that, you'll beat your record again.
Every day, you'll set a new record.
Sure.
But it's easy now.
In jail.
I don't have to make any choices for myself.
I worry about what's gonna happen when I get out.
What if I relapse again? Then you'll get sober again.
Let me tell you something.
I was at the office the other day, doing the "Hokey Pokey" with some work associates Uh-huh.
and I realized everyone misunderstands that song.
"The Hokey Pokey"? Yeah, there's way too much emphasis on the "hokey pokey" part.
That is what it's all about.
No.
That's exactly what I mean.
That's not what the song is saying.
Okay.
And I was thinking about my mom, you know, my relationship with my mom.
It's weird.
You know, awkward.
I feel like she doesn't really get me, but, you know, she's trying.
And a couple years ago, I never thought I would have any kind of relationship with her.
Like, I was sure of it.
What changed? I don't know.
I did? Or Or she did? Or, um, we are? Huh.
So, that's what I'm talking about.
It's like the song says.
"You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.
" You turn yourself around.
That's what it's all about.
Yeah, I don't know if the songwriters put that much thought into the existential significance of the lyrics.
They literally rhyme "about" with "about.
" But isn't the point of art less what people put into it and more what people get out of it? Is that the point of art? Maybe.
Or maybe art doesn't need a point.
Maybe that's why it's called art.
I can't tell if you're being smart or stupid.
Oh, I never know.
I think you had it for a moment and then you lost it.
Oh, well! It was nice while it lasted, right? Sure.
It was nice while it lasted.
Ugh! Huh! Not bad.
Hey, there he is! Oh, my God, that was an incredible wedding.
Yeah? It wasn't too much with the fireworks, and the cirque performers, and the procession of exotic peafowl? No, you produced the hell out of it.
What'd you think about the part where the priest got murdered and Judah had to figure out which bridesmaid was the culprit? A little outside the box, as far as weddings go, but it worked in context.
I thought so, too! Congratulations.
And Judah, too.
Where is he? I think he's going over some contracts.
We're putting together an all-female reboot of 12 Angry Men.
It's called "11 Angry Women.
" Not 12? You gotta leave room for a sequel.
So your groom is doing paperwork during his own wedding reception? Oh, we had our real wedding a week ago.
This one's just for the industry.
What? I invited the town's top talent, took away their phones, and shuffled them together.
Give 'em some booze, get 'em chatty, next day, they're calling me, "Hey, could you put me in touch with so-and-so?" Boom! I've attached myself as a producer! Does that really work? Hey, Jennifer Jason Leigh! Have you met regular Jason Lee? You're my two favorite Jason Lees.
Discuss.
Well, I am offended I wasn't important enough for your real wedding, but I'm flattered I'm important enough for your industry one.
Are you kidding? "Horny Unicorn" is tracking huge.
What? All of Hollywoob is buzzing about your comeback.
No.
Did you say "Hollywoob"? If this movie does what it's supposed to, the district attorney's not the only one who's gonna wanna lock you into something.
I'm not sure I should take on more projects.
I started this drama program at prison and we're doing Hedda Gabler.
I mean, it's not Strindberg, but, you know, we're having a good time.
I thought that maybe when I got out, I could go back and volunteer.
Oh! Well, that sounds fabulous! Yeah, but I didn't even think that I'd have other options.
A year ago, everyone in this town hated me.
People have short memories.
It's the best and worst thing about people.
Well, maybe there's a way I could do both? I've really enjoyed teaching.
Oh! Oh.
Maybe I could direct something? I'm sorry I said anything.
I Well, I mean, hold on.
Yeah, I shouldn't just jump into something, but if there's a good opportunity, I'd be stupid not to take it, right? I mean, we both know how hard it is to get heat in this town.
Think it over.
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.
Well, a decision.
Hey, you wanna dance? Yeah.
What? Oh! Aw.
You know, I had this weird idea when I heard you were getting married that I'd get here and there'd be some disaster, and I knew that either I would cause it or, just maybe, I would be the only one who could fix it.
A disaster, huh? Not like a "disaster" disaster, like a sitcom disaster, you know? Like, it would be time for the wedding and no one would know where to find you.
No one but you, right? Yeah.
And I'd find you in some special spot and I'd say, "Come on, it's time to go.
" And you'd say, "What am I doing, BoJack?" And then what, I'd run off with you? No, I would talk you into going through with it, and it would be like a symbol of how much I'd grown, that I could let you go.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
No, I mean, I'm happy for you.
Just it's a better story if you had cold feet.
It's a better story for you.
I think I like it better this way.
I guess you're right.
What would you have said to me? Oh, I don't know.
I would have said, uh, "Come on, man.
Do it.
" Oh, wow.
No, no, no.
I would Okay.
Hold on.
Tell me what you're afraid of.
In this make-believe scenario that you came up with? Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I guess I'm afraid of losing some part of myself.
I'm afraid that if I let someone else take care of me that I'm not really me anymore.
I'm afraid of getting too comfortable, you know, going soft.
I'm afraid that this could be the best thing that ever happened to me and if it doesn't make me as happy as I'm supposed to be, that means I'm a lost cause.
Holy shit.
What? I don't know, those are some really good arguments.
Are you kidding me?! Okay, okay, look.
Yes, all those things could be true, but on the other hand, what if you deserve to be happy and this is a thing that will make you happy? And maybe don't worry about whether you'll be happy later and just focus on how you're happy right now? Oh, is it that easy? No.
But you're here because, at some point, Princess Carolyn thought this was a good idea.
And I think we oughta listen to her.
Because she's the smartest woman I know.
That's true.
She is.
So, what do you think? Are you gonna marry him? Well, I already got the dress.
But you didn't need me to say any of that, did you? I guess I didn't.
Hey, if I do decide to get back into the business when I get out of prison I mean, I probably won't, but if I do, I'm gonna need representation.
Someone who can look out for me, help me make the right decisions, keep me out of trouble I can recommend some excellent people.
Hey.
Thought I might find you here.
I'm trying to quit.
Yeah, you look like you're trying really hard.
Don't be shitty.
I haven't seen you in a while.
You doing okay? Yeah, I'm doing okay.
I mean, you know, okay.
Sure.
I'm working on this middle-grade fiction series.
I mean, who am I, Rick Riordan? Who's Rick Riordan? Yeah, good point.
What have you been up to? Well, let's see, um, I've been getting into podcasts, went through a Sudoku phase, and, uh, oh, I'm in prison, so Right.
That's still happening? Oh, it's very much happening.
I've also got a new movie coming out.
Oh, yeah, with Vance Waggoner, right? I know what you're thinking, but he's You don't need to explain yourself to me.
I know you think I'm some kind of a sell-out, but it wasn't like other opportunities were banging down my door I'm not arguing with you.
Because of "Horny Unicorn" I'm not going to help you work through whatever you're trying to work through.
I just came out here to smoke.
You came to me.
Because I wanted to talk to you.
About what? "The Horny Unicorn"? No, about I don't know.
I just wanted to talk to you.
I miss talking to you.
I wish I had my phone right now.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I never know what to do with my hands at parties.
No, I wish I had my phone so I could play you the last voicemail you left me.
Did you remember that, that you left me a voicemail? Ooh.
I thought you were sober.
You told me you were sober.
And things were good in my life and I was thinking about my future, and then I woke up one morning and I had this voicemail.
Look, I-I wasn't in the You were happy on the voicemail.
You sounded happy.
Or lightly sardonic, or glibly nihilistic, or however you'd describe that thing you get that's the closest to the emotion normal people call happy.
I'm sorry And you were clearly intoxicated, and you were talking about swimming.
"I'm going swimming," you said.
"Since nothing matters anyway, and nobody cares about me, I might as well go swimming, right?" I'm so sorry.
"Call me back if you don't want me to go swimming.
Otherwise, I'm just gonna assume you don't care.
" I thought you were dead.
For seven hours, I couldn't get in touch with anyone and I was sure you were dead, and it was my fault for leaving you, for feeling good, for not worrying.
When I left for Chicago, you promised me you were gonna be okay, but I made you promise me that.
Was I selfish for believing you? No.
Why did you call me? You knew I was in Chicago.
I don't know.
I was drunk and and I was high.
And I just I wanted to talk to you.
When I found out you weren't dead, I was angry.
I was relieved, but I was also angry that I'd given you that power over me.
I was angry at you for a really long time.
Are you still angry at me? No.
I don't know.
What good has being angry at you ever done for me? I'm sorry.
I wish I could have been the person you thought I was, the person who would save you.
That was never your job.
Then why did you always make me feel like it was? I don't know, maybe it's everybody's job to save each other.
I don't know.
Anyway, I'm glad you're alive.
I am, too.
So, you're still in Chicago, then, or? When I got that voicemail, my boyfriend at the time wanted me to move to Houston with him.
I wanted to move with him.
But after you called, I got scared.
Oh, no.
I didn't trust myself.
I was happy and I didn't trust that.
So I stayed in Chicago.
We tried to make it work long distance, but it was hard.
Eventually, I just thought, "This is stupid.
" So, what, you broke up with him? No.
I moved to Houston.
To be with your boyfriend at the time? Yeah.
Plus, the winters in Chicago are cold as shit, I don't know why anyone would build a city there.
No wonder that cow started that fire.
I get it.
I'm on Team Cow.
But your boyfriend at the time, he's not your boyfriend anymore? He is not.
Wow.
Yeah.
How'd you learn how to trust it? The happiness? I didn't.
But I trust him.
It's hard to imagine you in Houston.
Oh, I'm like a totally different person now.
Are you? No? Yes? I wear fewer jackets.
I smile more.
Sometimes I look back at my LA years, and I think, "Who was that person?" Does she ever come back, that Diane? Sometimes.
I felt her when I got back to LA.
I feel her now that I'm talking to you.
But it's not you? I mean, it's all me.
I'd love to say, "No, she's gone forever.
" But I was terrified of coming back here for the wedding.
Seeing Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Seeing you.
What'd you think was gonna happen? I don't know, I would spin out, start questioning everything, blow everything up.
But that didn't happen, did it? No.
That didn't happen.
But was part of you kinda hoping that it would? Mm.
You ever miss the mess? No, "miss" is the wrong word.
Sorry, Miss.
I'm glad I lived in LA, but I'm not nostalgic for it.
I'm glad I knew Mr.
Peanutbutter, even though he's not in my life anymore.
Yeah? I think there are people that help you become the person that you end up being, and you can be grateful for them even if they were never meant to be in your life forever.
I'm glad I knew you, too.
"Knew," huh? Mm.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if this night was the last time we ever talked to each other? Um, anyway, I I need to tell you No.
You don't have to You don't owe me anything.
No, I need to tell you: Thank you.
And it's going to be okay.
And I'm sorry.
And thank you.
Wait.
Why? I know.
I know.
But can I just tell you a funny story? Sure.
But it better be very funny.
I don't wanna lie to you, it's only kind of funny.
So we have this movie night at the prison, right? And we get to vote on what movies we wanna see.
But of course the whole thing's rigged, because Big Andy's favorite movie is The Family Stone, so Big Andy gets his guys to vote for it every week, and so every week we watch The Family Stone.
Hold on, whose favorite movie is The Family Stone? I mean, yeah, it's a fine movie But every week? That's what I'm saying! So, one day I'm like, "If I see Luke Wilson teach Sarah Jessica Parker how to let her freak flag fly one more time, I'm gonna snap.
" I don't understand, is movie night mandatory? No.
So why don't you just not go? What am I, a philistine? I support the arts, sue me.
Okay, sorry.
But I know a guy who volunteers in the library, which is where they keep the DVDs, so I make a deal with him.
"I'll give you my Jell-O for a month if The Family Stone goes missing.
" I feel like this doesn't end well.
So, movie might comes around, time for another Christmas in Connecticut, but then, uh-oh, the DVD's gone, what do we do? So Big Andy's getting really upset, and his guys are all riled, and then I go, "Fellas, fellas, fellas! Why don't we watch Pieces of April this week? Change of pace.
Patricia Clarkson's in it and" And? Prison riot.
Oh, shit, really? No.
Worse.
Big Andy falls in love with Pieces of April, so now we watch Pieces of April every week.
You kind of made your own bed on that one.
Story of my life.
I'm sorry, that sounds awful.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? Life's a bitch and then you die, right? Sometimes.
Sometimes life's a bitch and then you keep living.
Yeah.
But it's a nice night, huh? Yeah.
This is nice.
